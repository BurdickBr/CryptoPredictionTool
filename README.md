### Important files/directories for running project: 
---
* ***CryptoPredictionTool.ipynb****
  * This file contains the Jupyter notebook, which consists of:
    *  All logic pertaining to the collection, creation and organization of the data used for model
    *  Training and testing of model
    *  Retrieval of live data and final prediction
*  ***CryptoPredictionAPI.py****
   *  This file contains the logic necessary for the generating the price prediction in the form of a web API. 
*  ***cpt Directory***
   *  Directory contains the entirety of the front-end React application for running this project.

**NOTE*: If you plan on running these two files, and you do not have the required *secrets.py* file supplied with the submission of this project, you **must** create your own api keys and store them in a secrets.py file in your locally pulled version of this repository.
