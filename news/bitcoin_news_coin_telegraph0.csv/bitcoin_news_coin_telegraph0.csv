0,"Amid the looming Ethereum London hard fork, Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead predicted that the upcoming upgrade would likely help Ether (ETH) outpace Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest cryptocurrency.As a newer cryptocurrency, Ether has more potential than Bitcoin, Morehead said at the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Monday, noting that the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 upgrade will help the digital token to trade more like a fixed asset.One of five EIPs in the Ethereum London upgrade, EIP-1559 is an anticipated update to Ethereum’s existing fee structure, introducing a minimum payment for sending Ethereum transactions and move away from a bidding system that allows miners to prioritize the highest bids. Designed to programmatically adjust fees for users to pay the lowest bid for each block, the EIP-1559 upgrade could potentially make Ether a deflationary asset.“You’ll see a transition of people who want to store wealth, doing it in Ether rather than just Bitcoin,” Morehead predicted, adding that the cryptocurrency’s shift to Ethereum 2.0 will significantly reduce Ether’s mining energy consumption levels compared with the one of Bitcoin. Ethereum’s wide implementation in decentralized finance applications would also help Ether grow bigger than Bitcoin, he said.Despite predicting a brighter future for Ether, Morehead is still optimistic about Bitcoin’s growth in the future. The CEO reportedly predicted that Bitcoin would trade between $80,000 and $90,000 by the end of 2021, rising above $120,000 within a year. Surging mainstream adoption could further drive Bitcoin’s price to as high as $700,000 in the next decade, Morehead noted.Related: Ether price hits 2-week high as London hard fork momentum buildsLaunched in 2015, Ether is the second most valued cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization amounting to $290 billion at the time of writing. Scheduled to take place on Wednesday, the Ethereum London is one of the biggest Ethereum upgrades designed to move its blockchain from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake, meaning that the network would mostly rely on staking instead of mining. Launched in 2009, Bitcoin relies on the PoW consensus algorithm.Morehead is not alone in thinking that Ether could outperform Bitcoin in the future. Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital, predicted in late June that Ether could become the “biggest cryptocurrency one day.”"
1,"Bitcoin (BTC) outflows from centralized exchanges have surged to their highest level year-to-date, with roughly 40,000 BTC being withdrawn over the past seven days.According to Glassnode’s Monday “The Week On-Chain” report, Bitcoin outflows have accelerated to a rate exceeding 100,000 BTC per month for just the third time since September 2019. The on-chain analytics provider estimates that just 13.2% of circulating BTC is currently held on exchanges — a new low for 2021.“This represents a near full retracement of the significant inflow volume observed during the May sell-off,” the report noted.Outflows surged to nearly 150,000 BTC monthly at the end of April 2020 following the violent “Black Thursday” crash that saw crypto prices tumble by more than 50% in less than two days after then-United States President Donald Trump announced a travel ban between Europe and the U.S. in March as the coronavirus pandemic intensified. Despite the aggressive crash, Bitcoin had rebounded by 150% by the end of May 2020, driving heavy accumulation.Outflows again came close to 150,000 BTC monthly in November 2020 as Bitcoin surged to test its then-record price high of $20,000, with BTC rallying into new all-time highs the following month.Glassnode notes divergent trends between Coinbase and Binance throughout most of 2021, with Coinbase having experienced significant outflows, while Binance has been the largest recipient of BTC.However, Binance’s reserves are now beginning to dwindle, with 37,500 BTC (worth roughly $1.5 billion) exiting the exchange over the past week.Coinbase balances remained steady in June. While the exchange received 30,000 BTC in mid-July, 31,000 BTC was withdrawn from the platform this past week.Related: Traders are withdrawing 2,000 BTC from centralized exchanges dailyLooking at the macro sentiment, the on-chain analytics provider referred to its “Liveliness metric” to identify trends in accumulation.The metric, which measures the ratio of the sum of coin days destroyed and the sum of all coin days ever created, indicates a broad trend of accumulation following May’s immediate sell-off.“It seems that HODLing and accumulation is the most likely dominant trend in the on-chain market,” the report concluded."
2,"Bitcoin (BTC) might have suffered its largest coordinated attack over the last couple of months, but in this instance, the investor community did not capitulate. China outright banning mining in most regions after giving BTC miners a two-week notice and this caused the single largest mining difficulty adjustment after the network hash rate dropped 50%.The market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin was already damaged after Elon Musk announced that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to the environmental impact of the mining process. It remains unknown whether China’s decision was influenced or related to Musk’s remarks, but undoubtedly those events held a negative effect.A couple of weeks later, on June 16, China blocked cryptocurrency exchanges from web search results. Meanwhile, derivatives exchange Huobi started to restrict leverage trading and blocked new users from China.Finally, on June 21, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) instructed banks to shut down the bank accounts of over-the-counter desks and even their social networks accounts were banned. OTC desk essentially act as a fiat gateway in the region so without them it would be difficult to exchange from Bitcoin to stablecoins.As these events unfolded, some analysts were reluctant to describe the tactics as nothing other than meaningless FUD, but in hindsight, it appears that China launched a very well-planned and executed attack on the Bitcoin network and mining industry.The short-term impact could be considered a moderate success due to the collapse in Bitcoin price and the rising concerns that a 51% hashrate attack could occur.Regarding Bitcoin Mining and China, I would not believe anything you hear. I would not rule out the possibility that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to orchestrate a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network. Stay vigilant.Despite the maneuvers, China's attack ultimately failed and here are the main reasons why. After peaking at 186 million TH/s on May 12, the Bitcoin network hash rate, an estimate of the total mining power, started to plunge. The first couple of weeks were due to restrictions to coal-powered areas, estimated at 25% of the mining capacity.However, as the ban extended to other regions, the indicator bottomed at 85 million TH/s, its lowest level in two years.As the data above indicates, the Bitcoin network's processing power recovered to 100 million TH/s in less than three weeks. Some miners had successfully moved their equipment to Kazakhstan, while others shifted to Canada and the U.S.Even though the companies involved in crypto transactions have been banned from the country, individuals continued to act as intermediaries—some of these recorded over 10,000 successful peer-to-peer transactions according to data from the exchange’s own ranking system.Both Huobi and Binance offer a similar marketplace where users can trade multiple cryptocurrencies including USD Tether (USDT). After converting their fiat to stablecoin, transacting on a regular or derivatives exchange becomes possible.A complete crackdown on trading from Chinese entities would likely be reflected in the exchanges previously based on the region, like Binance, OKEx, and Huobi. However, looking at the recent volume data, there hadn’t been a meaningful impact.Take notice of how the three 'Asia-based' exchanges remain dominant, while Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitfinex are nowhere near their trading activities.China's ban on Bitcoin mining and transactions may have led to some temporary hiccups and a negative impact on BTC price, but the network and price have recovered in a way that is better than many expected.Currently, there is no way to measure the OTC transactions where larger blocks are traded but it is just a matter of time until these intermediaries find new gateways and payment routes.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

3,"Bitcoin (BTC) dropped back below $39,000 on Aug. 2, suggesting that short-term traders were booking profits after the price failed to close above $42,451.67. However, lower levels could again attract buying as seen in late July. Data from Santiment showed that Bitcoin held on wallet addresses storing between 100 and 10,000 Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high at 9.23 million Bitcoin on Aug. 1. The previous all-time high for this group of investors was recorded on April 5, just over a week before Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $64,854 on April 14.Santiment highlighted that the “addresses have accumulated approximately 170,000 more Bitcoin” in the last four weeks. A similar pace of purchase was seen in late December 2020, just before the start of the strong bull move in 2021.CoinShares data showed that the assets under management in Bitcoin-focused funds dropped by $20 million last week, its fourth successive weekly decline. Over the past month, Bitcoin funds have witnessed cumulative outflows of $67.8 million.The data was not all bearish because multi-asset funds attracted cumulative inflows of $7.5 million last week and $11.9 million over the past month.Could Bitcoin break out of its range and lead the crypto markets higher? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin peeked above the overhead resistance at $42,451.67 on Aug. 1 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. This shows that bears are attempting to keep the range-bound action intact.The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($36,968) and the relative strength index (RSI) above 62 suggest that the sentiment is positive. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to push and sustain the price above $42,451.67.If they succeed, it will signal the start of a new uptrend. The first target on the upside will be a move to the overhead resistance zone at $50,000 to $51,500 where bears may again mount a stiff resistance.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the $36,670 support. That will indicate that the BTC/USDT pair could extend its consolidation between $28,805 and $42,599 for a few more days.Ether (ETH) broke above the downtrend line on July 31, invalidating the descending triangle pattern. The bears sold at higher levels on Aug.1 as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick but the positive sign is that bulls did not allow the price to drop below the downtrend line.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,273) and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that bulls are in control. The ETH/USDT pair could now rally to the psychological level at $3,000 where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears pull the price back below the 20-day EMA, it may trap the aggressive bulls. This could result in long liquidation, which may sink the pair to $2,000 and then to the critical support at $1,728.74.Binance Coin (BNB) rose above the overhead resistance at $340 on Aug. 1 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests that bears are attempting to defend this level.Although the price dipped back below $340 on Aug. 1, the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. If the price consolidates between the moving averages and $340, it will improve the prospects of a break above $340.If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern. This setup has a target objective at $454.58 but the climb may not be easy because the bears will erect roadblocks at $380 and then again at $433.On the downside, if bears sink the price below the moving averages, the pair could drop to the trendline. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the next stop could be $211.70.Cardano (ADA) rose above the downtrend line on Aug. 1 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests that bears are defending the resistance aggressively.The marginally rising 20-day EMA ($1.27) and the RSI above 56 suggest that bulls have a slight advantage. If buyers can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, it will invalidate the descending triangle pattern.The ADA/USDT pair could then rise to $1.50 where the bears may again pose a stiff challenge. If buyers can overcome this resistance, the pair could start its journey toward $1.94.This positive view will be negated if the price turns down and plummets below $1.20. That could open the doors for a further slide to $1.14 and then $1.XRP has been consolidating near the overhead resistance at $0.75 for the past few days, which suggests that bulls are not booking profits as they anticipate the relief rally to extend further.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is above 63, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers drive and sustain the price above $0.75, the XRP/USDT pair will complete a double bottom pattern, which has a target objective at $1.If bulls fail to sustain the price above $0.75, short-term traders may close their positions. That could drag the pair down to the moving averages. A break below this support will suggest that the pair may extend its stay inside the $0.50 to $0.75 range for a few more days.Dogecoin (DOGE) has been consolidating near the overhead resistance at $0.21 for the past few days. This suggests a state of uncertainty among the bulls and bears.The flat 20-day EMA ($0.20) and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. Usually, a tight consolidation near the stiff resistance resolves to the upside. If buyers thrust the price above the $0.21 to 50-day simple moving average ($0.22) resistance zone, the DOGE/USDT pair could rise to $0.28 and then to $0.33.On the contrary, if bulls fail to clear the overhead hurdle, it could attract profit-booking. The pair could then gradually slide down to the critical support at $0.15. A bounce off this level may keep the pair range-bound between $0.15 and $0.21 for some more time.The $16.93 level had acted as a stiff resistance between June 22 to July 8 but the bulls propelled Polkadot (DOT) above it on Aug. 1, which is a positive sign.The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is just below the overbought territory, suggesting that buyers have the upper hand. If bulls flip $16.93 to support, the DOT/USDT pair may continue its journey to $26.50.On the other hand, if the bears pull the price below $16.93, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($15.21), which may act as a support. If the price rebounds off this level, the buyers will again attempt to resume the relief rally. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could result in a retest of $13.The long wick on Uniswap’s (UNI) candlestick on Aug. 1 suggests that bears are defending the overhead resistance at $23.45, but the positive sign is that bulls have not given up much ground.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, indicating that buyers have the upper hand. A break above $23.45 will clear the path for a possible rally to $30.If the price again turns down from the overhead resistance, the UNI/USDT pair is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA ($19.55). If the price rebounds off this support, it will improve the prospects of a break above $23.45.Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.Related: There’s no reason not to hold Bitcoin for 100 years, Michael Saylor saysBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading between the 50-day SMA ($498) and the overhead resistance at $546.83 for the past four days. A tight consolidation near a stiff resistance suggests that buyers are not closing their positions as they anticipate a move higher.If bulls sustain the price above $546.83, the BCH/USDT pair will complete a double bottom pattern. This bullish reversal setup has a target objective at $710.13. The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive zone, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the pair could extend its range-bound action between $383.53 and $546.83 for a few more days.The bulls pushed Chainlink (LINK) above the overhead resistance at $22.07 on July 30 but the bears are not allowing the buyers to have a runaway rally.The bears are attempting to pull the price back below $22.07 but the bulls have held the support for the past three days. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating that buyers have the upper hand.If bulls drive the price above $24, the LINK/USDT pair could rise to $26.48. A break above this resistance could clear the path for a possible rally to $32.Alternatively, if the price breaks below $22.07, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($19.17). A strong rebound off this support will suggest that sentiment remains positive as traders are buying on dips. The bears will have to sink the price below the moving averages to gain the upper hand.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

4,"While Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has slipped by more than 8.2% after rising to $42,230, the 43.5% rally included 10 consecutive days of gains. But despite BTC currently trading at around $39,700 as of Monda, some analysts anticipate that it can rise by another 100%.Nunya Bizniz, an independent market analyst, posted the bullish setup on Sunday, noting that each of the cryptocurrency’s previous 10-day bull runs has ended up doubling its prices at a later stage.Therefore, if history repeats or rhymes, Bitcoin’s price can go up by more than 100% in the next 30–60 days.Bizniz noted that the next Bitcoin peak could form on Sept. 21, 2021, citing the cryptocurrency’s performances before and after its previous two halving events. The halving is a pre-programmed phenomenon written into Bitcoin’s source code that automatically reduces its new supply rate by half every four years.After the first halving in 2013, it took Bitcoin prices approximately 326 days to establish a new record high. Meanwhile, following the next halving in 2016, Bitcoin rose to a new peak 526 days later. That shifts the date of Bitcoin’s cycle peak to Sept. 21, 2021, coinciding with the 10-day bullish fractal mentioned above and based on its previous halving in May 2020.Short story:

A+B= pic.twitter.com/iWwK4IpEtIMeanwhile, Seeking Alpha financial markets contributor Ariel Santos-Alborna noted that the current Bitcoin cycle is more similar to 2013 than 2016. Back then, the BTC/USD exchange rate topped out at $255 in April, bottomed in July at $66, and then rose to a peak of $1,150 in December.Similarly, the pair reached almost $65,000 in April, later plunged to around $29,000 in July, and, as Santos-Alborna believed, was heading for a new peak in the next 2021 fiscal quarter.Related: BTC price sees 6% correction in contrast to booming Bitcoin on-chain dataBut the analyst warned traders against setting up their upside targets based on previous price rallies. For instance, a run-up from $66 to $1,150 in 2013 does not mean Bitcoin will rise from $29,000 to, say, $256,000 in 2021.“Both tops occurred in November and December, respectively, which could insinuate that the trigger for bear markets has more to do with taxes,” explained Santos-Alborna, adding that $88,000–$150,000 is a “more realistic” upside target for Bitcoin in 2021.The statements come at a time when regulators and governments have increased their scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. That includes a recent push by United States lawmakers to impose more taxes on the profits made by cryptocurrency investors.

5,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen an impressive rally of 44% with 10 green days in a row. This rally and the substantial number of green days resulted in a sentiment shift. Practically two weeks ago, the market was comparable to a funeral, with many expecting more downside to $20,000. However, the sentiment completely shifted after the breakout above $31,000. The current sentiment is the expectation of Bitcoin to rally to $100,000 or higher in the second part of this year, while on-chain analysts are back on their game, once again.Is Bitcoin going to break upward from here, or will a healthy correction take place? Let’s take a look at the technicals. The weekly chart shows the current range-bound construction for BTC/USD. In this construction, a breakout didn’t happen. Last week, Bitcoin’s price tried to break through the resistance zone but couldn’t force a breakout yet.Therefore, the conclusion is that the market is still unsure about the market direction at this stage. However, the weekly chart also shows apparent support in the zone between $28,000 and $31,000. This level has been tested several times and is still holding up as support despite the extreme bearish euphoria the last time Bitcoin’s price visited that range.Finally, if the market wants more information about the direction, the lower time frames often indicate further clues that should be watched.Bitcoin’s daily chart doesn’t tell us much information, even though the recent rally was a steep staircase of green candles.This rally not only showed the interest in the market but also that the most popular projections are often wrong. Many people anticipated a further crash to $20,000 when Bitcoin’s price was hovering around $30,000. On-chain analysis shows that short-term holders have been selling heavily in that range, anticipating a further correction to be happening, while long-term holders have been accumulating heavily.Thus, the exact opposite of a correction took place. Bitcoin rebounded by 44%, while altcoins have seen gains of 70%–150%.Further, if Bitcoin’s price can’t break further upward above $42,000, a potential higher low scenario can be validated in the region around $36,000 or $33,000.However, a substantial corrective move to $33,000 would be unwelcome if the market is truly bullish, as such a correction would grant an entry position to the latecomers once again.Moreover, a correction to $36,000 would generate a higher low, which would confirm a market trend change. After a higher high, a higher low confirms a trend change and the bullish divergence, making the $36,000 scenario the optimal level for this to happen.The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has seen a devastating and rapid crash by 55%, resulting in a sentiment switch from euphoria to depression.However, looking at the chart, a healthy and beautiful retest has been made at the $1.1-trillion levels. This level wasn’t tested during the entire move-up. Now, it has finally got this retest, resulting in buyers stepping in.This level is comparable to the $28,000–$31,000 region for Bitcoin, which has survived multiple tests. The total market cap of crypto doesn’t seem to be ready for an upward breakout, however, as it’s currently facing a critical resistance zone at $1.75 trillion.The red zone has been showing resistance multiple times, forming a range-bound construction. In that structure, a higher low is needed to confirm a change in trend. In that regard, a higher low at $1.35 trillion would be a good level for bullish continuation. If the total market capitalization breaks above $1.75 trillion, new all-time highs will become likely.The one-hour chart for Bitcoin shows a clear picture of the current market. On the four-hour chart, a bearish divergence is spotted, which will be confirmed if the price of Bitcoin drops beneath $38,500.With the one-hour chart, the price of Bitcoin dropped beneath the support level at $40,800. This drop means a market breakdown has taken place and the subsequent support had to be tested. That next support level can be found at $38,600.The breakdown didn’t have much volume, however, as the actual stops are placed beneath the recent low at $38,500. Therefore, a heavier correction toward $36,500 and $35,000 is on the table if the market breaks down once more.Such a correction would correct the entire market, through which Ether (ETH) could see a drop to $2,300 and $2,000 as well.The crucial levels on the downside are found at $38,500, as well as at $36,500 and $35,000.Finally, the crucial resistance to breaking Bitcoin’s price is found at $40,600–$41,000. If that level breaks, it’s very likely to see a continuation of the rally happening to $48,000, as the price of Bitcoin will take out the recent high at $42,000.However, after such a substantial rally and a fast sentiment switch, a correction is very healthy, especially if Bitcoin can’t break above $40,800 in one go.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

6,"Institutional outflows from cryptocurrency funds intensified last week, a sign that fund managers were still taking profits on their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings following a historic run-up through April. Digital asset investment products saw cumulative outflows totaling $19.5 million for the week ended Friday, marking the fourth consecutive weekly drawdown, according to CoinShares data.The bulk of the outflows were concentrated in Bitcoin-focused funds, where assets under management declined by $20 million. That, too, was the fourth consecutive weekly decline. Meanwhile, funds dedicated to Ethereum (ETH) saw weekly outflows totaling $9.5 million.Related: Ethereum investment products see largest weekly outflows on record — CoinSharesMulti-asset investment products continued to buck the trend as institutional investors increased their allocation by a cumulative $7.5 million. Multi-asset funds have attracted $11.9 million in inflows over the past month. By comparison, Bitcoin funds have seen cumulative outflows totaling $67.8 million over the same period.As Cointelegraph reported, institutional selling of cryptocurrency in June reached its longest streak since the onset of the 2018 bear market. At the time, the Bitcoin price was hovering around the $32,000 mark following several failed breakout attempts. Sentiment has clearly shifted over the past week, with Bitcoin briefly reclaiming $42,000 before correcting lower.Institutions continue to have significant exposure to cryptocurrency investments. By Coinshares’ calculation, the major fund providers have a combined $45.1 billion in assets under management. Institutional exposure could rise in the short term if the bullish case for the four-year market cycle is validated.Related: German law allowing institutional funds to hold crypto comes into effect Aug. 2"
7,"Amid a renewed bullish trend on the cryptocurrency markets over the past few weeks, more users have moved into trading Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Data from blockchain analytics platform Glassnode shows that Bitcoin has seen a notable surge in terms of active addresses in the past week of July, with active BTC entities rising 30% from 250,000 to 325,000 active users.According to Glassnode’s seven-day exponential moving average statistics of active Bitcoin entities, this is the biggest surge recorded after the number of active Bitcoin entities dropped 41% from 425,000 in January to below 245,000 addresses in early July. The current level of Bitcoin activity corresponds to levels maintained in July 2020, when Bitcoin was trading around $11,300, Glassnode noted.#Bitcoin has seen a resurgence in Active Entities over the past week, rising by 30% from 250k to 325k active entities per day.

This degree of activity was sustained in July 2020 when $BTC prices were around $11.3k in Q2-2020.

Live Chart: https://t.co/jsxqAS9wdk pic.twitter.com/TWtrtLvnehAlongside a significant uptick in active Bitcoin users, BTC investors have been accumulating larger amounts of the cryptocurrency in late July.According to data from analytics company Santiment, the amount of Bitcoin held on addresses storing 100-to-10,000 BTC hit 9.23 million Bitcoin ($364 billion) as of Aug. 1, which is a new all-time high for this group of investors. The previous all-time high took place on April 5, just one week before Bitcoin price broke an all-time high above $64,000.Related: Betting on tax bill FUD: 5 things to watch in Bitcoin this week“In the last four weeks, these addresses have accumulated approximately 170,000 more BTC. This staggering pace was last matched in late December 2020, right before a massive bull run kicked off in 2021 where prices jumped from $29.0k to $40.8k in the year’s opening week,” Santiment noted.The latest growth in Bitcoin activity comes amid the BTC steadily gaining momentum after Tesla CEO Elon Musk disclosed that his firm SpaceX owns Bitcoin on July 22. The CEO also said that Tesla was planning to resume crypto payments for vehicle purchases, citing the increasing percentage of renewable energy used for Bitcoin mining. Musk is known for being likely to contribute to Bitcoin’s price crash earlier this year, cutting BTC payments for Tesla in May due to the rapid increase of fossil fuel usage for Bitcoin mining."
8,"Marathon Digital has announced the purchase of additional Bitcoin mining hardware from Bitmain.According to a release issued on Monday, the United States-based Bitcoin (BTC) mining giant has completed a purchase deal for 30,000 Antminer S19j Pro at a reported cost of $120.7 million.The news marks a continued increase of Marathon’s Bitcoin mining inventory, with Bitmain expected to complete the delivery of the new rigs by June 2022.With the 30,000 rigs in tow, Marathon’s total Bitcoin miner count will go north of 133,000, delivering an estimated hash rate of 13.3 exahashes per second (EH/s).To put the figure into perspective, data from BTC.com puts the top three BTC mining pools at between 13.16 EH/s and 18.67 EH/s.At 13.3 EH/s per second, Marathon will effectively control over 12% of the current Bitcoin mining hash rate.Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon, alluded to the benefits of such a commanding presence in the global hash rate distribution with the announcement quoting him saying:Related: Four North American Bitcoin miners that could benefit from the East-West shiftChina’s Bitcoin mining crackdown has upended the global hash rate distribution, with North American participants expected to control a larger portion of the industry. Even before Beijing’s actions against crypto mining, American and Canadian mining giants upscaled their capacity with new inventory from the two major Bitcoin makers — Bitmain and MicroBT.The East-to-West hash rate migration may also serve to improve the carbon footprint associated with Bitcoin mining. Marathon is among a growing list of U.S. miners reportedly committed to “green mining.”Meanwhile, Chinese miners have reportedly begun to set up shop in Kazakhstan, with the immediate impact being an increase in the Bitcoin mining hash rate."
9,"Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $39,000 on Aug. 2 in what traders had long predicted would be a necessary reaction to recent gains.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting local lows of $38,915 on Bitstamp Monday.After a successful weekend turned less optimistic, the start of the new week saw mixed activity as Bitcoin bulls faced off with the prospect of fresh FUD from regulators.For Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe, a comedown was nonetheless not just likely, but necessary.“Given the vertical move that we’ve had, it would be very surprising if we just continued moving towards $48,000, as that is the next point of interest,” he explained in a fresh YouTube update.Van de Poppe noted that low volumes on the rise to local highs above $42,500 fuelled the argument that such levels constituted a “fakeout.”Should downside take hold more convincingly, $38,500 has formed a potential bounce zone, with the area between $34,800 and $36,000 critical to hold as support, he added.At the time of writing, BTC/USD was back above $39,000, still down around 5.6% over the past 24 hours.Despite volumes remaining low for supporting a bullish advance, meanwhile, on-chain data showed a return to form among Bitcoin entities at large.Related: Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, UNI, LINK, SOL, XMRAs noted by Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovski Capital, average weekly active Bitcoin network entity numbers were back at levels last seen before the May BTC price drop.It’s not the only metric to have “erased the dump,” as Moskovski called it — strong hodler command of the BTC supply has also rebounded strongly, with illiquid supply hitting all-time highs.In additional good news, the entire realized cap of Bitcoin was growing again as August began, something stock-to-flow model creator PlanB suggested was a bullish event.#bitcoin realized cap is rising again!

10,"The Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) stirred interest among crypto enthusiasts last year after investing $5 million in blockchain-based oil trading company Vakt. While this move aimed to digitize and streamline post-trade processing, Saudi Aramco was also rumored to undertake Bitcoin (BTC) mining activities. However, Saudi Arabia’s state oil company released an official statement to dismiss the ongoing rumors around mining Bitcoin. It said:Many governments, including China, have recently unleashed a crackdown on home-grown crypto mining activities, forcing businesses to find refuge in other crypto-friendly countries. On the other hand, Middle Eastern countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia continue to test the latest innovations around cryptocurrency. The Central Bank of Bahrain recently issued a license to an in-house crypto exchange for legally operating within the country.Related: UAE to experiment and launch an in-house digital currencySaudi Aramco has an extensive history of investing in blockchain firms. As reported by Cointelegraph, a Saudi Aramco Subsidiary was part of a $6-million deal with Data Gumbo Corp. for developing a commercial blockchain network. Just last month, the Central Bank of the UAE announced its 2023–2026 strategy that highlighted concrete steps to experiment and launch an in-house digital currency. As a part of this initiative, the UAE government intends to implement a digital identity system “to bolster financial inclusion and easy access to financial services.”"
11,"Michael Saylor, CEO of business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, has staunchly defended the company’s bullish, long-term Bitcoin (BTC) position based on its unique potential to evolve into “the future of the property.”In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Saylor argued that MicroStrategy’s big bet on Bitcoin, which it has turned to the debt markets to sustain, is the “highest upside, lowest risk strategy” the company can pursue.“Some people think diversification means buying other types of cryptocurrencies or other kinds of equities,” he said. “We think that by holding Bitcoin, we’re diversified. Because we can see Bitcoin on the balance sheets of cities, states, governments, companies, small [and] big investors. Ultimately, Bitcoin is going to be the core to tech innovation at Apple, Amazon and Facebook, so we want to be holding the Bitcoin.” In response to his interviewer’s probing as to how the interests of large, centralized behemoths such as Twitter and Facebook can be reconciled with a decentralized network, Saylor made the case that Bitcoin holds the key to solving their endemic issues with cybersecurity and spam. Integration with Bitcoin — and, specifically, the micropayment-supporting Lightning Network — could tackle these by incorporating an ecosystem that can vouch for creditworthiness and trust:Saylor’s projection for Bitcoin’s long-term potential appears to be balanced between this capacity to support new functionalities on the web and to evolve into the future of the property. Related: MicroStrategy pledges to buy more BTC despite paper loss on its holdings of $424.8M in Q2The reason MicroStrategy has leveraged long on Bitcoin — for which it has controversially borrowed $2.2 billion at a blended interest rate of about 1.5% — is that the firm anticipates that Bitcoin, as an open property network, will be used by “billions of users.” While the firm currently takes a 10-year view, Saylor’s comments suggested his perspective is long in a truly maximalist sense:In the interim, the coin is nonetheless also meeting the needs of retail traders, Saylor observed, noting that cryptocurrencies in general offer users of apps like Robinhood the unique possibility of trading 24/7, 365 days a year. In his view, it “makes total sense” for Robinhood to drive hard and up its support for the new asset class. Yet among digital assets, Bitcoin, as the “risk-off king of all the cryptos,” is, for Saylor, still “where all the traffic and excitement is.”According to the results of a recent study from Crypto.com, the number of crypto users worldwide more than doubled from 100 million this January to 221 million in June. While Bitcoin retains the lion’s share of users, smaller altcoins have slowly eaten into both the veteran coin market share and the market’s second-most popular crypto, Ether (ETH)."
12,"Jack Dorsey’s cryptocurrency-friendly digital payments firm Square is expanding competition with global payments giants like PayPal by acquiring a major Australian lending company.Square announced Sunday that the firm has entered into a scheme implementation deed to acquire all of the issued shares in fintech company Afterpay in a $29-billion deal. The transaction is based on the closing price of the Square common share and is expected to be paid in all stock in the first quarter of 2022.The acquisition enables Square to further accelerate its strategic plans for payment ecosystems as the company is looking to integrate Afterpay into its Seller and Cash App business units to enable a “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) service.Also referred to as installment loans, BNPL transactions allow customers to pay a bill in small portions throughout a fixed period of time and are actively pioneered by global financial firms such as PayPal, Mastercard, Klarna, Citi and others.According to the announcement, the integration will enable small businesses to offer BNPL at checkout, allowing Afterpay consumers to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App and to discover that BNPL offers directly within the app. The integration marks a new milestone for Square in meeting the growing consumer demand for shifting away from traditional credit.Square co-founder and CEO Dorsey said that the acquisition will help the companies to deliver on their shared mission to make the financial system more accessible, fair and inclusive. “Together, we can better connect our Cash App and Seller ecosystems to deliver even more compelling products and services for merchants and consumers, putting the power back in their hands,” he noted.Related: DeFi on Bitcoin: Jack Dorsey says Square’s new division will make it happenAs part of the transaction, Afterpay’s co-founders and senior executives will join Square and help lead Afterpay’s related merchant and consumer businesses within Square’s Seller and Cash App ecosystems. Square has also agreed to establish a secondary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) to allow Afterpay shareholders to trade Square shares via CHESS depositary interests on the ASX.The news comes amid Square announcing notable second-quarter earnings, reporting 200% growth in Bitcoin (BTC) revenue. Square’s Bitcoin services generated $55 million in gross profit, increasing 223% year-on-year, while Cash App generated a gross profit of $546 million, surging 94%."
13,"Bitcoin (BTC) is at a crossroads as it starts a new week, hovering around $40,000 but with serious headwinds keeping it from bouncing higher.After an impressive weekend that saw highs above $42,500, a comedown saw BTC/USD lose the $40,000 mark.A reversal and consolidation were broadly expected — the pace of gains over the past week has rattled an investor base that until recently was still forecasting a drop to the $20,000 range.Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors that could shape BTC price action in the coming days.Stocks and the United States dollar continue to diverge from predicted behavioral patterns when it comes to Bitcoin.After China took aim at big tech late last month, Bitcoin began a serious rebound, but stocks were delayed in making up for lost ground.U.S. markets are now back on the up, however, while China remains nervous. As a result, the U.S. dollar is losing ground against its peers, which is something that runs contrary to predictions.At the time of writing, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) traded at just above 92, down from highs above 93 a week ago.As Cointelegraph reported, analyst Crypto Ed believes that the DXY needs to hit local highs of its own at around 94 before reversing downward and giving Bitcoin room to breathe. This, under current circumstances, is looking difficult to fulfill.“The dollar appears to be breaking down from the local ascending wedge,” fellow trader and analyst Scott Melker summarized last week.Beyond China, however, traditional markets still face familiar problems of their own, these still apt to put the cat among the pigeons when it comes to longer-term performance.“Shares remain at risk of a short-term correction or volatility as coronavirus cases rise globally, the inflation scare continues and as we come into seasonally weaker months, but surging company profits in the U.S. and lower bond yields are providing support,” Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital, said in a note quoted by Bloomberg Monday.When it comes to Bitcoin price action, it’s a tale of two markets this week.The blistering rally over the past seven days brought one group of investors in particular into focus — the large-volume buyers and sellers on over-the-counter (OTC) markets.While retail also picked up, it was these larger players who were on the radar of analysts.As exchanges’ BTC balances began to fall precipitously, speculation began to flow that institutional entities were back buying up the spare Bitcoin supply in a big way.At the same time, some old hands appeared to be selling, a phenomenon put down to “disbelief,” which nonetheless formed a sticking point for further price gains.As the weekend drew to a close, however, OTC activity also began to err on the side of caution. Data from major derivatives platforms, notably FTX, showed bets piling up for a price dip, which popular trader Pentoshi suggested could be linked to a cryptocurrency tax bill that could be ratified by U.S. lawmakers this week.Meanwhile, more figures show the likely extent of OTC participation in the market overall.“$131B worth of $BTC moved yesterday, but only 1% from the exchange deposits/withdrawals. Fund Flow Ratio for all exchanges hit the 2-year low,” on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant noted Monday.It’s by no means all doom and gloom in Bitcoin despite changes in trading habits.Fundamental indicators governing the network overwhelmingly favor bullish continuation, the latest data shows.The difficulty, arguably the key regulator of the network, saw its first positive adjustment since the May price crash this weekend — up 6% and set for further gains in 11 days’ time.This is no mean feat — the huge upheaval among miners caused by China is now in retreat as players settle overseas or increase existing non-Chinese operations.This is further evident in the hash rate, which according to best estimates briefly surged back above 100 exahashes per second (EH/s) over the weekend.“It’s stunning that Bitcoin hashrate just had its largest drop in history and price is up 40% in 10 days,” asset manager Travis Kling reacted on the weekend.At its peak, the hash rate hit 168 EH/s before dropping to post-China lows of 83 EH/s. The 50% decrease roughly corresponds to BTC/USD, which bottomed at $29,300 from $64,500 all-time highs.Besides the China narrative, another key talking point that appears to be diminishing in importance is the pit of Bitcoin’s mini bear market — the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) share unlockings.While dubious as a market force at best, the unlockings caused an uproar among even mainstream financial entities, which were convinced that they would crash the BTC price further.This turned out to be a non-starter, and with the unlockings almost over, GBTC itself is increasing its real-time market appeal.This is apparent in the fund’s premium trending back to zero from a maximum of -15.5%. On the weekend, with the latest data yet to become available, the premium stood at around -6%.“The final batch of GBTC unlocks have cleared, causing the GBTC premium to recover significantly from a 15.5% discount on the 15th of July to a discount of just 6.67%, possibly a signal that investors are confident in BTC’s recent recovery,” Delphi Digital, a research, consulting and investment firm, argued at the time.Grayscale saw two of its funds become available via $25-billion robo-adviser Wealthfront last week, while high-profile buy-ins also continue.The slight cooling from local highs above $42,000 has in fact been therapeutic for market sentiment based on one metric’s evaluation.Related: Bitcoin 'supercycle' sets up Q4 BTC price top as illiquid supply hits all-time highAccording to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which takes multiple factors into account when gauging sentiment across crypto markets, the dip below $40,000 has flushed out “greed.”On Monday, the Index stood at 48/100 — “neutral” territory — versus 60, or “greed,” on Sunday.In the meantime, $40,000 is by no means lost, with BTC/USD fluctuating around the level while doing its best to flip it to sturdy support. BTC price action, therefore, has room to grow without impacting sentiment to the extent that a sell-off is hugely likely.For contrast, Fear & Greed languished in the “extreme greed” zone just one week ago, seeing a giant transformation as Bitcoin ran up and exited the $30,000 zone.“Wow, Bitcoin Fear-And-Greed-Index significantly recovered from its heavy lows seen after the major bearish declines. Showing a lot of demand in form of greed came into the market with recent volatility upside bounce,” trader, investor and analyst Vince Prince commented in one of many surprising reactions to the changes."
14,"Jack Dorsey’s Square has reported a 200% increase in Bitcoin (BTC) revenue for the second quarter year-on-year (YoY).The company announced the impressive earnings figures in its second-quarter shareholder letter on Sunday. In the report, Square revealed its total gross profit grew 91% YoY to $1.14 billion.Bitcoin services drove $2.72 billion in revenue for the app, with a gross profit of $55 million and respective increases of 210% and 223%, respectively, year-on-year. Cash App generated a gross profit of $546 million overall, up 94% YoY.However, compared to the first quarter of this year, Bitcoin revenue and gross profit decreased and are down 22.3% from 3.5 billion.Square attributed the weaker performance to the more than 50% retracement suffered by the broader crypto markets during May and June.Square also reported an impairment loss of $45 million on the Bitcoin it holds. As Tesla holds its Bitcoin as an “intangible asset,” accounting rules require the firm to report an impairment loss when the asset’s price drops below its cost basis. Square is also not required to report increases in the value of its intangible asset holdings until the position is realized through a sale.According to Bitcoin Treasuries, Square currently holds 8,027 BTC worth an estimated $320 million at the time of writing.Related: Square doubles down on Bitcoin, investing another $170MSquare recently bought 3,318 BTC in February for $170 million, adding to its initial purchase of 4,709 BTC in October 2020.On Friday, Cointelegraph reported that mobile software firm MicroStrategy pledged to buy more BTC despite an impairment loss of $425 million on its Bitcoin stash for Q2. Tesla also reported an impairment loss of $23 million for the quarter."
15,"Nigerian cryptocurrency adoption continues to rise despite a government crackdown, with peer-to-peer (P2P) trade volume for Bitcoin (BTC) posting its second strongest week on record last month.According to data from Google Trends, Nigeria still ranks No. 1 by search interest for the keyword “Bitcoin” as of this writing. P2P Bitcoin trading denominated in the Nigerian naira has also steadily increased in 2021, with Nigeria ranking behind only the United States as the second-largest market for peer-to-peer BTC trading, according to Useful Tulips.The growing Bitcoin adoption in Nigeria has helped Sub-Saharan Africa emerge as the leading region by P2P volume, with the region posting $18.8 million in weekly volume to beat out North America’s $18 million this past week.A confluence of political and economic crises has spurred local crypto adoption, including social repression, currency controls and rampant inflation.Tensions in Nigeria have escalated since October after massive public protests opposing police brutality and the infamous “Sars” police unit swept the nation.The EndSars protests saw protestors attacked with tear gas and water cannons, with more than 50 civilians killed in total, including a dozen who were shot dead by police armed with live ammunition on Oct. 20.The government crackdown saw economic repression, too, with social organizations supporting the protestors with food and medical aid quickly finding their bank accounts frozen. Amid the violence, protestors increasingly turned to cryptocurrency in order to place their economic activity outside of the government’s reach.Adewunmi Emoruwa, the founder of Gatefield — a public policy organization whose accounts were suspended for providing grants to journalists covering the protests attributed Nigeria’s recent hostility regarding crypto assets to October’s protests, telling The Guardian:An anonymous source claiming to represent a social organization whose bank accounts were targeted during the turmoil also told the publication that their group has been able to pay members’ salaries with crypto despite the financial embargo.“We keep some securities in crypto — not too much but enough, sort of as an insurance policy,” they said. “When the ban happened we were, thankfully, able to pay salaries.”In February, the government banned licensed banks from processing cryptocurrency transactions in an attempt to crack down on digital asset adoption.However, Nigeria’s steadily rising P2P Bitcoin volumes suggest the country’s growing crypto user base has largely been driven underground in a bid to access crypto assets from outside of the government’s purview.Marius Reitz, the Africa general manager of crypto trading platform Luno, told The Guardian that Nigeria’s ban has only made cryptocurrency trading harder to monitor, stating:The government’s moves to repress crypto have also received internal criticism, with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo publicly rebuking the ban in February.Related: Why is Bitcoin $86K in Nigeria? Here's why the BTC premium is huge in some countriesDespite the country’s hostility toward decentralized crypto assets, Nigeria is currently exploring the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).In late July, Nigeria’s central bank revealed plans to begin trialing its CBDC from Oct. 1 of this year."
16,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) 43% rally from $29,482.61 on July 21 to $42,316.71 on July 30 has invigorated the bulls, who had been sitting on the sidelines. After the sharp rise, some analysts are debating whether Bitcoin could repeat its sharp bull runs of 2013 and 2017.Vailshire Capital founder and CEO Jeff Ross highlighted that Bitcoin had rallied tenfold in the second half of 2013 after facing three months of negative news. Ross said: ""I still contend that 2021 will behave in similar fashion.""PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow price model, said Bitcoin’s comeback in July was “like clockwork.” He said that the stock-to-flow model will remain valid if Bitcoin closes August above $47,000.Meanwhile, institutional investors continue to accumulate Bitcoin while the price is still depressed. Asset management firm GoldenTree, with about $45 billion in assets under management, has purchased an undisclosed amount of Bitcoin, according to The Street.Bitcoin’s short-term sentiment has clearly turned bullish, following the strong recovery of the past few days. Let’s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that may participate in the up-move in the next few days.Bitcoin’s (BTC) sharp rally of the past few days is facing stiff resistance at $42,451.67, but the positive sign is that buyers have not given up much ground. This suggests that bulls are not dumping their positions, as they anticipate the up-move to continue.The rising 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $36,800 and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If bulls drive the price above $42,451.67, the BTC/USDT pair could start a new uptrend, which could reach the psychological level at $50,000.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level, the bulls will attempt to defend the support at $36,670. A strong rebound off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $36,670 and $42,451.67 for a few days.The bears will have to pull the price below $36,670 to gain the upper hand. Such a move could unlock the possibility for a retest at $31,000.The four-hour chart shows that both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating an advantage to buyers. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at $42,451.67.Alternatively, if the bears pull the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). A strong bounce off this support will suggest that sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips.The bullish momentum may weaken if the price dips below the 50-SMA. Such a move could result in a decline to $36,670.Uniswap (UNI) rose above the downtrend line on July 30, invalidating the descending triangle pattern. This could result in a short squeeze as aggressive bears rush to cover their positions.If bulls drive the price above the $23.45 to $25 resistance zone, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to the stiff overhead resistance at $30. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI has risen into the positive territory, suggesting that bulls are in command.However, the bears may have other plans, as they are likely to try to defend the overhead zone. If the price turns down from the zone but rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($19.25), it will suggest that traders are buying the dips. That will increase the possibility of a break above $25 and a rally to $30.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and plummets below the moving averages, several aggressive bulls may get trapped. That may result in a drop to $17.24 and then to $13.The UNI/USDT pair could rise to $23.45 where the bulls may encounter stiff resistance from the bears. If the bulls do not give up much ground, it will suggest they anticipate a further rally. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone also indicate that the sentiment favors a further rise.This positive view will be negated if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that traders booked profits near $23.45 aggressively. That may result in a deeper pullback to the 50-day SMA.Chainlink (LINK) broke above the 50-day SMA ($18.73) on July 27, suggesting that bears were losing their grip. After a minor hesitation near the psychological level at $20, the bulls resumed the relief rally on July 30.However, the long wick on Aug. 1's candlestick suggests that the up-move may be losing steam.If the price turns down from the current level but rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($18.83), it will suggest that the sentiment has turned bullish. The buyers will then attempt to push the LINK/USDT pair toward the stiff overhead resistance zone at $32.50 to $35.Conversely, if the pair breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that bears have not yet given up. They may then pull the price down to the critical support zone at $13.38 to $15.Both moving averages are sloping up on the four-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting that bulls are in control. The bulls are likely to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the pair could resume its up-move, with the next possible stop at $26.20.On the other hand, if bears pull the price below $21, several aggressive bulls may get trapped. The price could then drop to the 50-day SMA. This is an important level for the bulls because if it cracks, the pair may extend its decline to $15.The bulls pushed Solana (SOL) above the downtrend line on July 31, invalidating the descending triangle pattern. Currently, the bears are attempting to pull the price back below the downtrend line and trap the aggressive bulls.The 20-day EMA ($30.49) has turned up and the RSI has risen above 61, indicating that buyers have the upper hand. If bulls buy the dip to the downtrend line, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned positive. The buyers will then try to resume the up-move by propelling the price above the $37 to $38.10 resistance zone.If they succeed, the SOL/USDT pair could rally to $44 where the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance. This positive view will invalidate if the bears pull the price below the moving averages. Such a move could open the doors for a further fall to $26.50.The bears are attempting to stall the relief rally near the overhead resistance at $38.10, but the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If the pair rebounds off the 20-EMA, the buyers will again attempt to clear the overhead hurdle. If they manage to do that, the pair could start its journey toward $44.A break below the 20-EMA will be the first sign of weakness. That may pull the price to the 50-SMA and delay the possible break above $38.10.Related: 3 reasons why Ethereum price might not hit $5,000 anytime soonMonero (XMR) broke above the downtrend line on July 26, which invalidated the developing descending triangle pattern. The failure of a bearish setup is a positive sign.The XMR/USDT pair has been consolidating in a tight range for the past three days. If bulls drive the price above $250, the pair could start its journey toward $288.06 and later to $316.23. The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating advantage to the buyers.If the price turns down from the current level but finds support at the 20-day EMA ($220), it will suggest that traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then make one more attempt to resume the up-move.This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the current rally was a bull trap.For the past few days, the four-hour chart shows the pair had been stuck between $180 and $227.50. The breakout of this range gives the pair a target objective at $275, but the bears have other plans. They are aggressively defending the psychological resistance at $250.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If bulls thrust the price above $250, the upward march may pick up momentum.On the downside, bears will have to sink and sustain the price below $227.50 to invalidate the bullish view.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

17,"Bank of America, one of the nation’s largest financial institutions based on total assets, believes El Salvador could have a lot to gain with its latest foray into Bitcoin (BTC).In a report published last week, analysts at the bank said El Salvador’s decision to recognize BTC as legal tender could streamline remittances, promote financial digitization, provide consumers with greater choice, and open up the country to American firms and digital currency miners.The bank noted that remittances account for a staggering 24% of El Salvador’s gross domestic product, but a sizable chunk of that goes toward transaction fees.“Using Bitcoin for remittances could potentially reduce transaction costs compared to traditional remittance channels,” the report said, according to an image provided by state-backed Diario El Salvador. “The idea is that Bitcoin could be used as an intermediary for the cross-border transfer so that dollars are converted to Bitcoin by the sender and then converted back to dollars domestically by the receiver.”#ElSalvador El Presidente @nayibbukele comparte esta mañana algunas de las oportunidades que @BankofAmerica ve en El Salvador, tras la adopción del #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/08D1RuGFYIIn June of this year, El Salvador became the first nation-state to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, marking an important milestone in the digital currency’s evolution from obscurity to mainstream acceptance. The decision to integrate BTC into the country’s financial system has been met with criticism by the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations’ Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.

18,"Bitcoin (BTC) closed July above $41,000 in a “bullish engulfing” candle that dramatically upends its previous downtrend.In a tweet on Aug. 1, investor and entrepreneur Alistair Milne joined many in celebrating a classic return to form for BTC price action.After seeing three monthly red candles in a row, BTC/USD held onto late gains to post a monthly close that few had anticipated.Despite the dip to $29,000, bears failed to stay in the driver’s seat as July drew to a close as resistance levels fell and sentiment improved. “Bullish engulfing on the monthly chart for Bitcoin,” Milne summarized. A bullish engulfing pattern is a chart pattern that forms when a small red candle is followed by a large green candle — i.e., July, the body of which completely covers or engulfs the body of the previous candle (June).The move up — and its staying power — has been so surprising that even seasoned hodlers appear confused about what to do next.On-chain data shows that some long-term holders (LTH) are in fact selling as BTC/USD rises, something that analyst Lex Moskovski believes corresponds to the “disbelief” stage of a classic market cycle.Moskovski highlighted the long-term holder spent output profit ratio indicator (LTH-SOPR), which this weekend hit its lowest levels in 2021.SOPR looks at the value of coins moved in a particular time period to get an impression of profitability of coins being sold. A downtrend toward the neutral 1 value, Glassnode explained, suggests that profitability among the coins in question is low.“Some long-term bitcoin holders are selling into this bounce with minimal profit as indicated by LTH-SOPR hitting this year’s low for two days straight,” Moskovski commented.Bulls, meanwhile, continue to look for triggers that could send BTC/USD past $42,000 resistance for good, this having seen two tests in the past 24 hours.Related: Bitcoin 'supercycle' sets up Q4 BTC price top as illiquid supply hits all-time highBeyond there, as Cointelegraph noted, little lies in the way until $45,000 and $47,000.Equally enthusiastic for upside on Saturday was PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow price model family, who described Bitcoin’s July close as being a recovery “like clockwork.”#bitcoin July closing price $41,490 ... it bounced from the lows, like clockwork pic.twitter.com/xZIlbaBBqIStock-to-flow, while currently demanding a Bitcoin price of nearly $100,000, remains valid, with PlanB giving a minimum August close requirement of $47,000."

A breakout and close above the neckline completes the setup, indicating that the downtrend has reversed.As shown above, the asset is in a downtrend but after a significant decline, value buyers believe the price has reached attractive levels and will start bottom fishing. When demand exceeds supply, the asset forms the first trough from the left shoulder and the price starts a relief rally.In a downtrend, traders sell on rallies. The bears sell aggressively after the pullback and the price dips below the first trough, making a lower low. However, bears are unable to capitalize on this weakness and resume the downtrend. The bulls buy this dip and start a relief rally, forming the head of the pattern. As the price nears the previous peak where the rally had stalled, the bears again step in.That starts the decline, culminating in the formation of the third trough, which is arrested almost in line with the first trough as buyers anticipate a turnaround and purchase aggressively. This forms the right shoulder of the setup. The price turns up and this time, the bulls manage to push the price above the neckline, completing the pattern.The neckline thereafter becomes the new floor as traders buy the dip to this support. This signals the start of a new uptrend.Bitcoin (BTC) had been in a downtrend since forming a local top at $13,970 on June 26, 2019. The buyers stepped in and arrested the decline in the $7,000 to $6,500 support zone, forming the left shoulder of the (IHS) pattern. This started a relief rally that pushed the price to $10,450. At this level, short-term bulls booked profits and bears initiated short positions, aiming to resume the downtrend.Aggressive selling broke the support at $6,500 and the Bitcoin/Tether (USDT) pair plunged to $3,782.13 on March 13, 2020. The bulls viewed this fall as a buying opportunity and that started a strong relief rally, which reached close to $10,450. This second trough formed the head of the setup.The right shoulder was shallow because the selling pressure was reduced and bulls did not wait for a deeper correction to buy. Finally, the bulls pushed the price above the neckline on July 27, completing the (IHS) pattern.The bears tried to trap the bulls and they pulled the price back to the neckline. Although the price dipped just below the neckline, traders did not allow the pair to sustain below $10,000. This suggested a change in sentiment. The bullish momentum picked up as buyers pushed the price above $12,500.To calculate the minimum target objective of the (IHS) pattern, calculate the depth from the neckline to the lowest point, forming the head. In the above example, the neckline is around $10,450, and subtracting the lowest point at $3,782.13 gives a depth of $6,667.87.This value is then added to the breakout level, which in the above example, is near $10,550. This gives a target objective at $17,217.87. When a trend changes from down to up, it may fall short or exceed the target objective. Therefore, traders should use the target as a guide and not dump their positions just because the level has been reached.No pattern succeeds at every breakout and traders should wait for the setup to complete before initiating the trades. Sometimes, the pattern structure forms but the breakout does not happen. Traders who preempt the completion of the pattern and initiate trades get trapped.For example, Chainlink’s LINK topped out at $4.58 on June 29, 2019, and started a correction. The buyers attempted to stall the decline in the $2.20 to $2.00 zone. This formed an (IHS) pattern with a head and two shoulders as can be seen in the chart above.Although the price reached the neckline on Aug. 19, 2019, the buyers could not push the price above it. Due to this, the pattern did not complete and the buy signal did not trigger.The LINK/USDT pair turned down from the neckline and broke below the head of the setup at $1.96, invalidating the pattern. This trapped traders who may have purchased in anticipation of a trend reversal.The (IHS) pattern could be a useful tool for traders to jump on a new uptrend as it is getting started. There are a few important points to remember while using this setup.Traders should wait for the pattern to complete, which happens after the price breaks and closes above the neckline, before initiating any long positions. A breakout of the neckline, which is on above-average volume, is more likely to result in a new uptrend compared to a breakout that happens on low volumes.When a trend reverses, it generally continues for a long time. Therefore, traders should not be in a hurry to dump positions only because the pattern target has been met. At other times, the pattern completes but quickly reverses direction and the price plummets. Traders should closely watch the other indicators and price action before squaring up a position.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

20,"Bitcoin (BTC) is gearing up for a comeback that should lead it to repeat the classic bull run years of 2013 and 2017, analysts are arguing.As $42,400 local highs appeared on Saturday, narratives around the market are flipping back to a bullish Bitcoin “supercycle.”Bitcoin has been busy repairing the impact of the China miner rout since mid-May, but last week’s price advances were stronger than most anticipated.Related: Bitcoin open interest mimics Q4 2020 as new report ‘cautiously optimistic’ on BTC rallyRather than suffer a serious dip, BTC price action has held onto its gains, which at the time of writing total 23% in a week.What seemed all but impossible just seven days ago is now the flavor of the month among an increasing portion of the analytical community.“History doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes” #bitcoin
A repeat would be a Q4 blow off top. New ATH’s into 2022 seem more likely. Super cycle/last cycle will depend on what happens in 2023 IMO. https://t.co/07Ryn3pcTf“Following a troubling three months of news and price action, bitcoin went on to print five green monthly candles in a row and went up ~10x in the second half of 2013,” Jeff Ross, founder and CEO of Vailshire Capital, said in Twitter comments Saturday.With its latest uptick, meanwhile, BTC/USD broke through its 21-week exponential moving average, which analyst Rekt Capital described as a “time-tested bull market indicator.”While Ross added that such a prediction was “just a guess,” he has an increasing number of on-chain indicators to support him.The hash rate is back above 100 exahashes per second (EH/s) after bottoming at 83 EH/s, while difficulty saw its first positive readjustment since the May price crash on Saturday.Investor behavior further mimics the change in sentiment. Strong hodlers with little to no history of selling their BTC are now back in control at levels never seen before and absent since Bitcoin’s current all-time high of $64,500 in April.“This is very bullish,” Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovski Capital, summarized alongside an accompanying chart from Glassnode. It showed hodler conviction in terms of an increasing amount of the BTC supply becoming illiquid — taken off the market.“Bitcoin ‘supply shock’ is now at levels that previously priced Bitcoin at $53K,” fellow analyst William Clemente III commented on the same data."
21,"In the last few weeks, the Bitcoin (BTC) mining market has experienced a black swan event, leading to a lot of uncertainty and confusion surrounding the future of the market. This is why I felt it was right to give the public a quick update and explain why it's a fantastic time for Bitcoin mining in the United States.Bitcoin miners are rewarded Bitcoin for securing the network and for each block they mine. As more miners participate, the difficulty rate increases and the reward for each individual miner’s security contribution decreases. And vice versa, when fewer miners are participating, the difficulty rate decreases and the reward for each miner’s contribution increases. Understanding this is key as to why this is an exciting time to get into mining.Related: A trade war misstep? China is vacating crypto battlefield to US banksRecently, we have experienced a historic decrease in the difficulty rate. This chart shows the initial impact of Chinese miners being forced to shut down and move out of China.Related: China crackdown shows industrial Bitcoin mining a problem for decentralizationThere are many potential reasons why this occurred, but the net result is that an exodus of Chinese miners and their equipment has begun. As of July 2, the rate was adjusted by -27.94 percent. It was the fourth negative adjustment that happened in a row, “with the difficulty rate almost halving since mid-May.”Let’s take a look at the most recent block time intervals.Even with record-high Bitcoin prices, we are still anticipating additional rate decreases in the near future.However, the difficulty decrease wasn’t over at that point, and with the additional drop of over 27% in early July, the volatility is still coming as the network catches up to the effects of all these miners going offline. These events have caused a lot of dramatic and quick changes to the crypto mining market, but their impacts can be boiled down to three major changes:The last time that the difficulty rate was around 15 trillion was in January 2020, with Bitcoin being worth only $7,000. Currently, the price of BTC is around $32,000, more than four times higher. With low-priced hardware for mining and the high price of Bitcoin, the opportunity in Bitcoin mining has never looked better. Right now, it's not about the mining equipment, it’s more about the infrastructure.As all investors know, the time to invest is when costs are heavily discounted. For Bitcoin mining, that’s right now.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

22,"Cash may be king when it comes to purchasing Bitcoin (BTC), as recent data states that there has been a spike in crypto ATM installations during 2021, showing a 71.3% increase from Jan. 1, 2021, until the time of reporting. Specifically speaking, there are currently over 24,000 crypto ATMs located across the globe. Data further suggests that crypto ATMs are being installed at a rate of about 52.3 machines per day. While growth is clearly underway for the cryptocurrency sector, the reason behind the surge in crypto ATMs may be due to a demand for using cash to buy Bitcoin. Alona Lubovnaya, director of product operations for Bitcoin Depot — a Bitcoin ATM operator — told Cointelegraph that more people from all walks of life are becoming interested in crypto, particularly the underbanked community. “We’ve entered a new era where traditional bank accounts can be replaced with digital wallets, and because of this, more people are choosing to buy crypto with cash.”While there are many reasons as to why certain individuals would want to buy cryptocurrency from an ATM versus an exchange, most of the common use cases seem to be focused on easy and quick access to crypto.For instance, one piece of research claims that over 50 million Americans are likely to buy cryptocurrency in the next year. Findings also indicate that a lack of understanding is the biggest barrier for new investors. Specifically, 20% of those surveyed said that they still don’t understand how to buy cryptocurrency.Derek Muhney, director of marketing and strategy at Coinsource — a provider of Bitcoin ATMs — told Cointelegraph that many people looking to get started with crypto value the haptic element of a physical machine, such as an ATM. According to Muhney, Bitcoin ATMs are the best way to buy Bitcoin for an increasing target group of unbanked and underbanked. While this may be obvious, Muhney further pointed out that this has become the case with baby boomers and millennials, noting that these users make up the lion's share of Bitcoin ATM transaction volumes to date.Echoing Muhney, Ben Weiss, CEO of CoinFlip — a Chicago-based Bitcoin ATM operator — told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin ATMs function primarily to make crypto digestible and attainable to new users who may not understand the intricacies of cryptocurrency or blockchain technology. To demonstrate this point, CoinFlip conducted a Twitter poll to find out how many people on Crypto Twitter have used a Bitcoin ATM. CoinFlip’s survey revealed that 72.2% of individuals never used a Bitcoin ATM, while only 27.8% noted they have.Weiss explained that he wasn’t surprised by these results, noting that Crypto Twitter is composed of people who are passionate about cryptocurrency and have a relatively deep understanding of the technology. As such, Weiss commented that mainstream users are the primary customers of Bitcoin ATMs:Alex Mashinsky, CEO and co-founder of Celsius — a centralized cryptocurrency lending platform — further elaborated on this, noting that there are many groups of customers in the crypto space. For example, Mashinsky explained that hodlers will never sell their crypto, while speculators aim to time the market. Yet, Mashinsky noted that “tourist” users will be the ones to likely leverage a Bitcoin ATM. Mashinsky added:Considering the fact that over 6% of United States households, or a total of 14.1 million American adults, are currently unbanked, Bitcoin ATMs will undoubtedly multiply moving forward. The estimate, further supported by Muhney, suggests that “more than 100,000 Bitcoin ATMs will be installed by 2025 and that the industry will grow to beyond $1.7 billion.""While this is notable for the growing cryptocurrency sector, security challenges may hamper adoption. John Jefferies, chief financial analyst of CipherTrace — a cryptocurrency intelligence firm — told Cointelegraph that as recently as last year, Bitcoin ATMs operating in Canada did not require any form of Know Your Customer, or KYC, processes. “None of these Bitcoin ATMs required KYC, making these the wild west,” Jefferies said. As the crypto space matured, Jefferies noted that the majority of Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. now require KYC from users:Jefferies added that this has also become the case due to examinations from entities like the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS: “Similar to traditional money services businesses, Bitcoin ATM providers will get visited by examiners. The IRS does this for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.”Moreover, Jefferies pointed out that CipherTrace is starting to see Bitcoin ATM providers take an interest in a solution to comply with the travel rule. The Financial Action Task Force's (FATF's) Travel Rule came into effect for Virtual Asset Service Providers, or VASPs, in 2020. The Travel Rule requires regulators and VASPs to collect and share customer data during transactions.According to Jefferies, CipherTrace is working with six Bitcoin ATM operators to apply a travel rule solution called ""Traveler"" to specifically address the counterparty VASP's due diligence that is demanded by the FATF guidelines. While the Traveler tool was recently implemented by some exchanges like Binance and Crypto.com, Jefferies shared that CipherTrace is making the product more viable for Bitcoin ATM operators to be compliant.Related: Crypto cowboys: Texas counties welcome Bitcoin miners with open armsAlthough this may be, some industry experts believe that Bitcoin ATMs are just as safe as traditional ATMs. Jonathan Ovadia, CEO and co-founder of Ovex — a South Africa cryptocurrency exchange — told Cointelegraph that based on the company’s research, “we don’t believe Bitcoin ATMs will be used for extremely large transactions.” As such, Ovadia noted that there is no need for specialized security compared to regular ATMs, both in terms of physical and cybersecurity.Eric Grill, CEO of Chainbytes — a Bitcoin ATM manufacturer — told Cointelegraph that the company operates HippoAtm.com, charging a hefty 17% fee per transaction. Grill shared that the average transaction amount on HippoAtm.com machines was $1183.92 for July 2021 and $1325.98 for June 2021.This is an important point to consider in terms of security. Jefferies shared that Bitcoin ATMs processing large transactions may be suspicious. For example, Jefferies referenced that in August 2019, Kunal Kalra, also known as “shecklemayne,” was operating an unlicensed money services business where he exchanged U.S. dollars for Bitcoin and vice versa. According to Jefferies, Kalra worked on commission and only dealt with customers willing to exchange at least $5,000 per transaction.Despite these concerns, Bitcoin ATM providers remain optimistic. Muhney stated that Coinsource end-users have already invested “several hundreds of millions"" into Bitcoin. “This is why we are extremely bullish about the next phase of spike adoption, similar to 2017/2018, which we expect for the second half of 2021.”"
23,"Bitcoin (BTC) shot to new highs of $42,400 on July 31 in a surprise attack on a range resistance that sellers failed to squash.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining for a tenth straight day across exchanges, reaching $42,420 on Bitstamp.A subsequent cooling-off preserved most of the gains, with Bitcoin circling $41,900 at the time of writing, still up over 8% over the past 24 hours.In trading circles, talk focused on a rare performance for the Bitcoin daily chart — ten green candles in a row, which last occurred in 2012.Bitcoin has closed 10 straight green daily candles! pic.twitter.com/6FEG4CgqLlEven eight days of consecutive gains are a rarity, while nine have been seen only twice. Depending on the exchange, the data can be slightly different — Coinbase saw 12 green candles one after another in May 2017, one Twitter user noted.Regardless, on one hand, Bitcoin’s strength was conspicuousness; on the other, there was a lack of bearish selling pressure.A glance at short activity on major exchange Bitfinex underscored the current mood, with hardly any trader willing to take on the risk of shorting the Bitcoin spot price at current levels.""BTC just tapped 42k as resistance for the first time since the epic drop in May,"" popular trader Scott Melker summarized on the day.As Cointelegraph reported, $42,000 represents the final resistance hurdle in Bitcoin's multi-month trading range. Since coming down from all-time highs and falling through the level, which also represents the previous all-time from February, it has acted as a de facto unchallenged price ceiling.Related: Price analysis 7/30: BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, XRP, DOGE, DOT, UNI, BCH, LTCAbove, orderbook data shows, little lies in Bitcoin's way — $45,000 or even $47,000 could easily be next, a hypothesis also supported by whale investing behavior.According to the popular and historically accurate stock-to-flow Bitcoin price forecasting models, the spot price should still be much higher — $94,839 on Saturday.Nonetheless, its creator, PlanB, has said that a monthly close of at least $47,000 for BTC/USD in August would be enough for progress to remain on track."
24,"Large price jumps and 100x gains get a lot of attention from pundits and influencers in the cryptocurrency community because they offer the hope of overnight riches.In reality, these opportunities are few and far between. Not to mention, only a handful of traders actually manage to catch these waves and cash out in time to lock in life-changing money. Fortunately, catching a large price surge is far from being the only way for crypto investors to make a buck, and the recent rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and the slow march of mainstream crypto adoption provides a near endless stream of investment opportunities.Let’s have a look at five different ways crypto holders can make an easy buck without actually having to trade.Staking, which rewards users for locking tokens on a protocol as collateral for transaction validation, is one of the best ways to earn a yield on assets held in a crypto-based portfolio.In August, the Ethereum network will switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus model to a proof-of-stake (POS) model, and Ether (ETH) holders who stake in the Eth2 contract can earn up to 5.83%.Under this new PoS system, token holders actively participate in transaction validation by locking their coins in nodes on the network that then vie for a chance to verify transactions, create new blocks and receive the rewards that come along with it.Data from Staking Rewards shows that a stake of 10 Ether currently results in a weekly earning of 0.0075 ETH, worth $17.96 at current prices, and a yearly earning of 0.3876 ETH which is currently worth $933.69.The percentage yield for Ether decreases as more tokens are locked on the network so the final earnings may change.Currently, the top five crypto assets by staked value are Cardano’s ADA, Ether, Solana (SOL), USD Coin (USDC) and Polkadot (DOT).All things considered, staking provides one of the best low-risk opportunities in crypto to gain a bigger stack regardless of market sentiment or performance, while also helping to support the network through transaction validation.The growth of the DeFi sector led to the development of a diverse crypto lending ecosystem, where users can deposit their cryptocurrencies to various lending protocols in exchange for rewards in the underlying token or in different assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether and various altcoins.Aave is the top lending protocol at the moment and the platform offers yield opportunities for tokens on the Ethereum and Polygon network with its native coin MATIC.The chart above shows the top seven lending pools available through the AAVE protocol on Polygon and rewards are paid in Wrapped MATIC (WMATIC), with the current deposit annual percentage yield (APY) being 1.92% and a yearly estimated APY of 6.1%.Other top lending protocols include Curve (CRV), Compound (COMP), MakerDAO (MKR) and Yearn.finance (YFI).Lending offers another low-risk way to earn a decent yield, in both bull and bear markets, on tokens that don’t offer user-controlled rewards like staking.Liquidity provision is one of the primary components of a DeFi platform, and investors who choose to provide funds to emerging platforms are often rewarded with high percentage returns on the amount staked, as well as a percentage of the fees generated by transactions within the pool.As seen in the image above, providing liquidity to an Ether/USDC pool on QuickSwap will entitle an investor with a percentage of the $23,098 in total daily distributed rewards and a fee APY of 33.81%.Ideally, long term investors would be wise to research the available pools on the market, and if a liquidity pair comprised of solid projects or even a stablecoin pair such as USDC/Tether (USDT) looks appealing, it has the potential to be the blockchain version of a savings account that offers far better yields than can currently be found in any bank or legacy financial institution.Yield farming is the concept of putting crypto assets to work in a way that generates the highest yield possible while minimizing risk.As new platforms and protocols emerge, they offer high incentives to depositors as a way of mining for liquidity and increasing the total value locked (TVL) on the protocol.Rewards for STKGHST-WETH LP deposits on DinoSwap. Source: DinoSwapThe high yields offered are generally paid out in the native token of the platform as seen above, where a user has deposited a liquidity pool token for an STKGHS-WETH pair which has an APR of 189.2% and has so far generated a reward of 3.312 DINO.For long investors who hold a portfolio filled with an assortment of tokens, yield farming is a way to gain exposure to new projects and obtain new tokens without having to spend new fundsRelated: Here’s why DinoSwap’s (DINO) TVL rose above $330M a week after launchBlockchain gaming and NFT collecting is another way to produce a return on a crypto portfolio without spending new funds.Axie Infinity is the most popular example at the moment, and the in-game play involves trading, battling, collecting and breeding NFT-based creatures known as Axies.Playing Axie Infinity generates rewards in the form of Smooth Love Potion (SLP), an in-game token that is used in the Axie breeding process and also trades on major cryptocurrency exchanges. Users can swap SLP for dollar-based stablecoins or other large-cap cryptocurrencies.According to data from Your Crypto Library, “Today, the average player earns between 150 to 200 SLP per day,” which, at current market value, is worth between $40 and $53.50.In some parts of the world, that amounts to the income provided by a full-time job. For this reason, Axie Infinity has seen a massive uptick in user activity and new accounts in countries like Venezuela and Malaysia.Crypto investing, lending, staking and play-to-earn blockchain games provide a much higher return on investment than traditional banks offer on savings and checking accounts. As the blockchain sector grows, it’s likely that investors will continue to flock to platforms that offer high yields for engaging with the protocol.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

25,"Bitcoin (BTC) and most major altcoins seem to be faltering near their respective overhead resistance levels. This suggests that some investors are continuing to sell at higher levels.However, 21st Paradigm co-founder Dylan LeClair said that on-chain data shows “big transfer volumes from over-the-counter (OTC) desks over the last week.” Cointelegraph also recently highlighted a historic 57,000 BTC outflow from exchanges on July 28.Ecoinometrics also cited on-chain data to show that ""whales"" and “small fish'' accumulated Bitcoin when the price recovered from $29,400 to over $40,800 this week.Institutional investors are also not to be left behind in their plans to accumulate more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy, which holds about 105,085 Bitcoin, said in its second-quarter report that the company intends “to deploy additional capital into our digital asset strategy.""Wealthfront, a popular US-based robo-investment firm $25 billion in assets under management, announced that it would allow its clients to allocate up to 10% of their portfolio into Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.With demand increasing from small investors and high-net-worth individuals, will cryptocurrencies stage a sharper recovery? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin formed a Doji candlestick pattern on July 29, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears near the $40,000 mark. That uncertainty briefly resolved to the downside and if the price does not hold its recent surge above $40,000 the price could drop to $36,670.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. If the price rebounds off $36,670, it will suggest that bulls have flipped this level into support.The buyers will then again try to push the price above the overhead resistance zone at $41,330 to $42,451.67. This may not be easy because bears will try to defend this zone aggressively.If the price turns down from the zone, the BTC/USDT pair could remain range-bound between $36,670 and $42,451.67 for a few more days. A breakout and close above $42,451.67 will suggest the start of a new uptrend.The bears will be back in the driver’s seat if they can sink the price back below the moving averages.Ether (ETH) reached the downtrend line today but the bears are defending the resistance aggressively. The price could now drop to $2,200 where buyers may step in and arrest the correction.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory, suggesting that bulls have the upper hand. If the price rebounds off the 20-day exponential moving average, the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the downtrend line.If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could rise to $2,600 and then to $3,000. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move could sink the price to $2,000 and next to $1,728.74.The bulls pushed Binance Coin (BNB) above the 50-day simple moving average ($310) on July 29 but they could not challenge the overhead resistance at $340. This suggests that buying dries up at higher levels.The bears will now try to take advantage of the lack of demand to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($305). A break of this support could result in a drop to the trendline and next to the July 20 low at $254.52.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest buying on dips. The bulls will then make one more attempt to clear the overhead resistance at $340. If they pull it off, the BNB/USDT pair could rise to $379 and next to $400.The failure of the bulls to drive Cardano’s (ADA) price above the 50-day SMA ($1.32) indicates that bears are aggressively defending the resistance.If the price breaks below the 20-day EMA ($1.25), short-term traders may close their positions and that could drag the price down to $1.10 and later to $1. A break below $1 could result in long liquidation.On the other hand, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to push the price above the downtrend line. If that happens, the DOT/USDT pair could rise to $1.50 where bears may again mount a stiff resistance.The bulls have failed to push XRP above the $0.75 level for the past two days, which suggests that bears are defending this level aggressively.The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. If bulls do not allow the price to break below the 20-day EMA ($0.64), the XRP/USDT pair may rise above $0.75. That will complete a double bottom pattern, clearing the path for a possible rally to $1.07.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and plummets below the moving averages. The bears will then try to pull the price to $0.59 and then to $0.50. Such a move will indicate that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.The bears have been defending the $0.21 resistance for the past few days but a minor positive is that bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that buyers are not closing their positions as they anticipate Dogecoin (DOGE) to move up.The flat 20-day EMA ($0.20) and the RSI above 45 suggest a balance between supply and demand. This balance will tilt in favor of the bulls if they can push and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.23). That may clear the path for a rally to $0.28 and then $0.33.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $0.18, the DOGE/USDT pair may drop to $0.15. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because if it gives way, the pair may witness panic selling and drop to $0.10.The bulls pushed Polkadot (DOT) above the 20-day EMA ($14.15) on July 27 but they have not been able to clear the hurdle at the 50-day SMA ($16.05). This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.The price has turned down from the 50-day SMA today and the bears will now try to sink the DOT/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $13. A break below this support could sink the pair to $10.37.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance at $16.93. If that happens, it will suggest a change in the short-term trend. The pair could then start its journey to $20 and later to $26.50.The bulls are attempting to push Uniswap (UNI) above the downtrend line but the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests that bears have other plans.If the price turns down from the current level but stays above the 20-day EMA ($18.50), it will indicate that bulls are buying on dips. That will improve the likelihood of a break above the downtrend line, invalidating the descending triangle pattern.The UNI/USDT pair could then rise to $24 and if this level is crossed, the up-move may reach $30. Conversely, if bears pull the price below the moving averages, the pair may decline to $17.24 and then to the critical support at $13.Related: Who takes gold in the crypto and blockchain Olympics?Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing stiff resistance at $546.83. This suggests that bears are attempting to defend the resistance of the range and extend the consolidation for a few more days.If bears pull the price below the moving averages, the BCH/USDT pair could witness further selling and drop to $441.17. A break below this level will open the doors for a further slide to the critical support at $383.53.On the other hand, if bulls do not allow the price to drop below the moving averages, it will enhance the prospects of a break above $546.83. If that happens, the double bottom pattern will complete and the BCH/USDT pair could start its journey toward the target objective at $710.13.Although bulls pushed Litecoin (LTC) above the 50-day SMA ($137) on July 28, they could not clear the hurdle at the overhead resistance at $146.54. This indicates that bears have not yet given up.If sellers pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($130), the LTC/USDT pair could start its downward journey to the critical support at $103.83. Such a move will indicate that the pair may remain range-bound for a few more days.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $146.54. If they succeed, the pair will complete a double bottom pattern, which has a target objective at $189.25.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

26,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exposure has come to one of the world's biggest automated investment firms.In a blog post on July 29, Wealthfront, which has $25 billion in assets, confirmed that it had added two Grayscale funds to its suite of investment options.The recent rise in cryptocurrency prices has kept institutional products such as Grayscale's various funds in the spotlight.Wealthfront, an example of a so-called ""robo advisor"" in the investments space, will now allow its clients exposure to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).""Buying cryptocurrency can feel intimidating — it takes time and effort to research all of the options, set up a wallet, and monitor an additional account. That’s why we’ve made it easy to get exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum right in your Wealthfront portfolio, no wallets required,"" the blog post explains.Clients will be able to have up to 10% of their portfolio in Grayscale products, a limit the firm attributes to the ""riskier and more volatile"" nature of crypto products.The move nonetheless reduces the ease-of-access dilemma faced by those interested in Grayscale's funds, which are not always directly available, and place strict rules on shareowners.Alongside Grayscale, meanwhile, Wealthfront increased its offering of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from ARK Invest, itself a major GBTC stakeholder.The announcement comes as institutional interest in Bitcoin in particular shows no signs of decreasing at prices around $40,000.Related: Bitcoin open interest mimics Q4 2020 as new report ‘cautiously optimistic’ on BTC rallyAs Cointelegraph reported, exchange balances have fallen sharply this week, as over-the-counter (OTC) desks also see significant activity.For its part, Grayscale has rid itself of a negative narrative surrounding unlocking of GBTC shares after the events had no perceptible impact on BTC price action.Remember when all the traditional analysts said the Grayscale unlock would unleash billions in selling this last week? Yeah, no.Its CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, this week reiterated a pledge to turn all Grayscale crypto funds into ETFs at the earliest opportunity, subject to regulatory changes in the United States."
27,"At the same time that China has declared war on cryptocurrencies, giant American banks appear to be embracing crypto — evident the final week of July with the news that crypto firm Lukka will provide State Street Bank’s private fund’s clients with digital and crypto asset fund administration services. This follows forays into the crypto space from the likes of BNY Mellon, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs among traditional bank heavyweights.Is it too early to speak of trend and counter-trend? And if a trade war has broken out between the United States and China, as many believe, why is China turning its back on cryptocurrencies while some of the West’s largest financial institutions, long wary of crypto, appear to see fresh value in blockchain-based digital currencies?“Yes, U.S. banks are firmly embracing Bitcoin as an investment tool,” Nik Bhatia, author of the book Layered Money: From Gold and Dollars to Bitcoin and Central Bank Digital Currencies and adjunct professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California, told Cointelegraph, adding, “JPMorgan and Goldman, for example, have greenlit Bitcoin investment products such as GBTC (Grayscale) for their clients.”“We can see that banks and other financial institutions, such as JPMorgan and Citi, are starting to realize that blockchain technology is not just a passing trend,” Bobby Ong, co-founder and chief operating officer of CoinGecko, told Cointelegraph. He added that “as such, they are beginning to explore ways for them to offer cryptocurrency products to their clients.”But what’s with China? Since the beginning of summer, it has taken steps to curb — if not outright ban — cryptocurrency mining and trading. Do China’s financial guardians know something that U.S. bank leaders don’t?“China doesn’t like crypto. It’s not a sovereign currency, and it’s beyond the Chinese government’s control,” Raymond Yeung, author of China’s Trump Card: Cryptocurrency and its Game-Changing Role in Sino-US Trade, told Cointelegraph, adding, “Even if it’s mined in China, it’s still not administered by them — it’s bypassing the PBoC (People’s Bank of China). That’s not acceptable.”“China is a state that wants to keep everything under its control,” agreed Ong, adding, “This can be seen from the recent crackdown on tech firms and even private education firms.” Bitcoin’s decentralized structure gives Chinese authorities fits, he suggested, and they would much prefer to create something that they can manage, like their digital yuan, which is in the process of being rolled out.It doesn’t help that Bitcoin (BTC) mining uses so much energy and contributes to global warming, either, Yeung further explained. China has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, and its “emissions target is real.” The government is already imposing emissions restrictions on the country’s steel industry, and it just introduced a national emissions trading scheme. Bhatia added, “China does not want Bitcoin miners hogging their [energy] grid.”If a trade war is indeed underway between the U.S. and China, hasn’t China miscalculated, though, by shutting down BTC mining operations, especially since North American miners are only too happy to take over China’s role as the world’s crypto mining center?“It might very well be a huge blunder, as hash rate that comes offline is very hard to get back,” Bhatia said, adding, “That hash power has likely left China forever.”“I think it’s difficult to say what China’s goals are in this particular situation,” commented Ong. He added, “They are aggressively trying to introduce the digital yuan as the de facto currency in the country and as a proxy to reduce the world’s reliance on the U.S. dollar.” As a result, when it comes to the core objective, this may not be a bad move: “It is in line with their goals of pushing for a centralized currency that is completely traceable by the government.”There may be some nuances with regard to Bitcoin mining, too. The People’s Republic of China could be using the mining crackdown to drive down the price of Bitcoin so the state can purchase more BTC at a cheaper price, Bhatia suggested, further explaining to Cointelegraph:Others agreed that China might have a hidden agenda. The “crackdown on Chinese miners might mean that they are offloading coin into a thin market and taking us lower,” according to Ben Sebley, chief growth officer of crypto firm BCB Group.Yeung, on the other hand, believes that China is serious about washing its hands of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but that doesn’t mean it is necessarily forsaking crypto’s underlying blockchain technology.“The government is willing to sacrifice BTC or Ether,” Yeung told Cointelegraph, “but they don’t want to sacrifice blockchain technology.” There is still a lot going on in China in terms of blockchain technology development. “The government treasures the technology, but not crypto itself.”Moreover, as the government has stated, “crypto is a source of financial risk,” said Yeung, adding further, “They want to control crypto, but they can’t. But they can still embrace blockchain technology, which they believe will improve productivity and spur economic growth.”Related: Death knell for Chinese crypto miners? Rigs on the move after gov’t crackdownMeanwhile, U.S. banks are acting like crypto’s summer swoon never happened. “The growth in popularity of digital assets is showing no signs of a slowdown,” said Nadine Chakar, head of State Street Digital, adding that State Street “is committed to continuing to build out the necessary infrastructure to further develop our digital assets servicing models.”“There is growing acceptance of Bitcoin’s role in being a hedge on the current fear of currency debasement,” Ong told Cointelegraph. “After the announcement of an unexpected hike in the inflation rate” — U.S. inflation skied 5.4% in June, the fastest rate in 13 years — “many people are considering alternative ways to preserve their wealth, and Bitcoin is starting to become a viable alternative.” Banks are in the business of offering financial services, and as the demand to hold cryptocurrencies rises, it is not surprising that they are eager to enter the industry, he added.U.S. banks may also have an eye on future customers. “With an influx of younger investors entering the market, they are more likely to invest in riskier and diverse asset classes,” said Ong, adding:The fact that Bitcoin continues to avoid any scrutiny as a security or as an investment product that requires additional oversight may also factor in the U.S. banks’ calculus. “It’s a commodity and is able to avoid the SEC [regulation], which is essential,” said Bhatia.Related: China’s crypto industry is gone? Beijing’s crackdown keeps sending shockwavesThe U.S.’s and China’s approaches to regulation are philosophically different, summarized Yeung. China’s government basically says, You need my approval for anything, while the U.S. says, If you do anything that hurts me, I will ban you. U.S. firms have more wiggle room, though. If the U.S. courts declare that BTC is a commodity, for instance, then regulators can’t ban it.Meanwhile, if and when a younger generation turns to professional money managers, it will probably expect at least some exposure to crypto assets — which means Western banks could be entrenched in the crypto space for years to come."
28,"Both small and rich Bitcoin (BTC) traders accumulated the benchmark cryptocurrency en masse during the period when its prices rose from below $30,000 to over $40,000, signaling their confidence in the asset’s long-term bullish setup.The basis of the upside outlook came from Ecoinometrics, a crypto-focused newsletter service. It highlighted in its latest edition a flurry of on-chain data that tracked the flow of Bitcoin into wallets that belonged to the richest crypto traders, known as “whales,” and to entities that held the cryptocurrency in smaller quantities — the so-called “small fish.”“After a couple of weeks of data showing that most address buckets are accumulating coins, Bitcoin is finally bouncing back from the $30k level,” wrote Nick, the author of the Ecoinometrics newsletters, as he highlighted a heat map that witnessed Bitcoin flowing into the small fish and whales’ wallets.The color red points to a situation, in which every group — whales or fish — has accumulated Bitcoin in the past 30 days. Conversely, the color blue corresponds to situations wherein only the smaller fish have accumulated the digital asset in the same timeframe.Bitcoin’s heat map has returned to red.“We can do the same plot for the current cycle and we observe pretty much the same thing,” noted Nick while pointing to the July 2020–July 2021 graph as follows.Data from other sources matched the Ecoinometrics’ analogy.For instance, crypto-focused data tracking service WhaleMap reported Thursday that the number of unspent transaction outputs currently belonging to Bitcoin whale wallets has spiked, thereby suggesting their intentions to wait for higher prices.“The last whale bubble in our range,” tweeted WhaleMap.The fundamentals backing whales’ involvement in the current Bitcoin rally pointed to fears of persistently rising inflation despite United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s attempts to sideline the issue in his recent press conference on Wednesday.Powell admitted that inflation has surpassed the Fed’s projections for 2021 but blamed it on the unusual nature of the U.S.’ economic recovery. He noted that supply bottlenecks have created shortages that have led to “temporary” price increases.The comments appeared as the Fed continues its expansionary policy of near-zero interest rates and $120 billion a month in bond purchases that, as the Wall Street Journal editorial noted, could have been stopped two months after its launch in March 2020.The journal cited the National Bureau of Economic Research’s report of last week, which noted that the U.S. recession officially ended in April 2020. “The FED has a real challenge ahead balancing its response to a global pandemic with low rates and seemingly rising inflation,” Jeffery Wang, head of Americas at Amber Group, told Cointelegraph, calling it “an extremely difficult situation” for central banks running their quantitative easing programs.Wang added that the backdrop of cheap money and rising inflation creates a bullish narrative for flight-to-safety assets such as equities, real estate and Bitcoin. He said:Pankaj Balani, CEO of the crypto derivatives platform Delta Exchange, meanwhile, anticipates Bitcoin to continue its bull run toward $50,000, citing options activity that he said remains heavily skewed to the upside at least until mid-August.Related: Bitcoin traders express mixed emotions about what’s next for BTC price“There is call buying activity across maturities — weekly, bi-weekly and monthly,” Balani told Cointelegraph in an email statement.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

29,"Bitcoin (BTC) is being aggressively bought up by institutional entities this week as data shows over-the-counter (OTC) trading volumes spiking.As noted by Dylan LeClair, co-founder of analytics and advisory firm 21st Paradigm, high-net-worth individuals have a clear interest in Bitcoin at current prices.Citing data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, LeClair eyed a sudden uptick in OTC activity just as BTC/USD hit local highs of $40,700.A classic tandem event, OTC trading increases tend to accompany a BTC price spike.In May and June following the comedown from those highs, OTC entities bought on temporary price dips. The same phenomenon has occurred throughout the 2021 bull run, even before all-time highs appeared and BTC/USD was still on the way up.“Big transfer volumes from OTC Desks over the last week,” he commented.While the latest spike was not the largest in terms of volume, data shows impressive flows from major exchanges.As Cointelegraph reported, around 57,000 BTC left exchanges in a single day on Wednesday, while Thursday saw Kraken alone shift a giant 98,000 BTC as buy-ins accelerated across the market.Despite losing over $400 million on its BTC stash in Q2, meanwhile, MicroStrategy, arguably the king of institutional Bitcoin investors, has already pledged to buy more.Friday’s price performance, meanwhile, may precipitate a replay of earlier buying interest.Related: Bitcoin traders express mixed emotions about what’s next for BTC priceAt the time of writing, BTC/USD circled $38,600, having dived 2.7% in an hour as a streak of bearish sentiment entered the market.While nothing unusual, the volatility highlights the difficulty bulls face in overcoming resistance, be it psychological at $40,000 or technical at $41,000 and above.Patiently waiting for volatility to kick in on #Bitcoin here.

30,"The rumor that Amazon would accept cryptocurrency payments sparked a wave of bullish enthusiasm across the crypto market earlier in the week, but now this sentiment has begun to wane as Bitcoin (BTC) bulls face stiff resistance at the $40,000 level. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that bears have fended off multiple attempts to flip the $40,000 level to support, and defense of this zone continued on July 29 as Bitcoin's stagnant price action and added to concerns that the price could fall back to last week's $35,000 to $30,000 range.Here’s what analysts and investors are saying about the recent developments in Bitcoin’s price.Bitcoin's rapid ascent from $31,000 to $40,925 lifted the price near its 21-week exponential moving average, a level that is widely considered as a bull market indicator, according to pseudonymous crypto Twitter analyst Rekt Capital.The 21-week EMA is largely regarded as a #BTC Bull Market indicator

BTC is now fighting to breakout beyond the 21-week EMA (green)#Bitcoin #Crypto pic.twitter.com/rMqeWzJS4iAs seen in the tweet above, the 21-week EMA is currently near the $40,000 price level, effectively becoming the ""line in the sand"" that separates bulls and bears.One of the responses to the above tweet offers a word of caution for overly bullish traders, as similar moves in the past were followed by lower lows and an extension of bear market conditions.As shown by the yellow circles in the chart above, previous instances of the price breaking above the 21-week EMA have resulted in a reversal that leads to a retest of lower lows in the following weeks and months.One group of market participants who have shown little evidence of indecision are Bitcoin whales, who have embraced Warren Buffett's mantra to “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” by buying up low-priced BTC as weaker hands tap out.#Bitcoin's whales have been staying busy, and addresses holding between 100 and 10,000 $BTC just reached a combined #AllTimeHigh 9.19m coins held. They have added 170,000 more $BTC since May 22nd, and a staggering 130,000 $BTC in the past 4 weeks alone. https://t.co/qv5IbYXgGQ pic.twitter.com/PwrmUyz9OfAccording to data from Santiment, an on-chain and behavioral analysis platform, whale wallets have accumulated 130,000 BTC in the past four weeks as the price of Bitcoin traded below $35,000.With such heavy accumulation being seen in the lower $30,000 to $35,000 range, some analysts have suggested that whales may attempt to orchestrate another pullback in price so that they can continue to accumulate.Related: Bitcoin bulls control Friday's $1.7B monthly options expiryWhen near-term confusion prevails, sometimes it's best to take a step back to see the bigger picture of where the market is and what possibilities the future holds.According to Inmortal Up Only, a pseudonymous Twitter user, Bitcoin's four-year cycle is currently about 65% through its bull-market phase, and the trader predicts a top at $150,000, which will be followed by a correction to $32,000.For traders and holders who prefer to operate on a longer time scale, there remains plenty to be optimistic about in the future, and experienced market participants know that the price moves seen over the past few months are part and parcel of Bitcoin’s normal progression.Further confirmation of the long-term perspective was offered by Ecoinometrics, which compared Bitcoin's current post-halving price action to performances in the previous two halvings.#Bitcoin after the Halving

31,"On Friday, July 30, a total of 42,850 Bitcoin (BTC) options contracts ($1.7 billion) are set to expire. This might be the first time since the May 21 weekly expiry that bulls will be able to profit from the $40,000 call (buy) options. The most recent surge in price may have been prompted by the rumor that Amazon would accept crypto payments, but after the e-commerce giant denied these rumors, BTC has held relatively steady.According to options markets, regardless of the reason behind the recent market strength, a few incentives are in place for bulls to sustain the $40,000 level.While the initial analysis favors the neutral-to-bullish call options by 21%, according to the call-to-put ratio, a decent number of those bets were placed at $45,000 and higher strikes. These options are almost worthless with less than 14 hours until maturity.Bears were overconfident for the monthly expiry, and 87% of the neutral-to-bearish put options have been placed at $39,000 or lower. If bears are to suppress the price below this level on July 30, a total of $105 million put options will be available.Meanwhile, the neutral-to-bullish call options below $39,000 amount to $320 million. The net result is a $215 million advantage favoring the neutral-to-bullish call options.Sustaining the price above $40,000 on July 30 would increase the bulls' lead by $140 million. This difference seems enough to justify a price push above that level, at least until 8:00 am UTC when Deribit expiry takes place.Bitcoin futures expiries occur simultaneously, but unlike options, longs and shorts are evenly matched at all times.An aggregate of $650 million in BTC futures is set to expire this Friday, but this will depend largely on the CME's $455 million because traders might close their position before the expiry, which happens on Friday at 3:00 pm UTC.At the moment, the options market data largely favors bulls, at least for the short term.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

32,"The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, plans to “step up” its monitoring of digital currencies, according to a report by Reuters. This intent, as published in an IMF paper Thursday, details how the fund plans to “manage this far-reaching and complex transition” toward a digitized economy.“Rapid technological innovation is ushering in a new era of public and private digital money,” the report reads, highlighting the benefits of digital assets. “Payments will become easier, faster, cheaper, and more accessible, and will cross borders swiftly. These improvements could foster efficiency and inclusion, with major benefits for all.”Related: IMF plans to meet with El Salvador’s president, potentially discussing move to adopt BitcoinHowever, such implementations can only occur if the IMF can “keep pace with policy challenges,” which require a deeper look into digital economies as a prospect. The fund plans to work with institutions “consistent with its mandate,” such as central banks, regulators, and the World Bank while expanding its own digital money research.As disclosed in an April 2021 paper, the IMF plans to add five sets of experts to properly conduct research. Their skills include lawyers, digital risk experts, financial sector experts, fiscal economists, and data specialists. This set of skills should thoroughly cover research into the digital currency industry, the paper claims.The fund will target Central Bank Digital Currencies, or CBDCs, stablecoins, cryptoassets, and more. It will examine how these assets represent financial independence, can act as reserve currencies, and how they can replace current payment systems.Related: Steve Hanke warns BTC could ‘completely collapse the economy’ of El SalvadorEarlier this week, the IMF published a warning regarding El Salvador’s recent Bitcoin law. While it didn’t mention the country directly, the warning noted that “granting cryptoassets legal tender status” could threaten local economies, not to mention the time-consuming process of citizens “choosing which money to hold.” Conversely, the IMF went on record earlier this month claiming that CBDCs could provide the global financial system with a “clean slate.”"
33,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are locked in a battle with bears to take control of the $40,000 level and dovish comments from the United States Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, suggest that loose monetary policies will remain in place for the foreseeable future.Generally, the crypto ecosystem is “cautiously optimistic” about further price rises as the fallout from China’s miner purge begins to subside and displaced miners begin to establish mining operations in other countries, resulting in a rebound of the Bitcoin hash rate.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that while the momentum in Bitcoin has slowed down, several altcoins have gained more than 30% on the 24-hour chart, led by THORChain (RUNE), Quant (QNT) and Perpetual Protocol (PERP).The top performer over the past 24 hours has been THORChain, a decentralized liquidity protocol that facilitates the exchange of cryptocurrencies across multiple networks while allowing the tokenholder to retain full custody of their assets.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for RUNE on July 24, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for RUNE first spiked to a high of 85 on July 24 and then pulled back slightly over the next two days and registered a high of 75 on July 26, around 18 hours before its price began to rally 65% over the next two days.The price of RUNE has been hammered in recent weeks after a series of protocol exploits resulted in $7.6 million worth of funds being drained from the platform, but it appears as if the fallout from that has now subsided.The second-largest gainer in the past 24-hours was Quant (QNT), a project focused on interoperability between different blockchain networks.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for QNT have been favorable for some time.As seen on the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for QNT began to pick up on July 25 and reached a high of 81, around 24 hours before the price increased 75% over the next two days.The NewsQuake™ alert system caught the announcement from Binance that it would be listing QNT just before its price began to significantly rise from $96 to an intraday high at $144.75.Related: Crypto population doubled to over 200M users since January, report saysPerpetual Protocol, a decentralized perpetual contracts protocol that includes an on-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) and up to 10x leverage, also broke out on July 30.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for PERP on July 25, prior to the recent price rise.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for PERP climbed into the green on July 25 and reached a high of 79 early on July 26, around 24 hours before the price increased by 52% over the next two days.The building momentum behind PERP comes following the release of Curie, a second version of the Perpetual Protocol.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

34,"Cryptocurrency adoption has seen an accelerated growth this year, with the global crypto population doubling since January, according to a new report.Major digital asset company Crypto.com released its latest study on measuring global cryptocurrency users on Thursday, discovering that the number of crypto users worldwide has more than doubled from 100 million in January to 221 million in June.The firm pointed out that crypto adoption has been growing rapidly this year, as it only took four months to nearly double the crypto population from 106 million in February to 203 million in May. For comparison, it took nine months for the number of global crypto users to reach 100 million from 65 million since Crypto.com started tracking crypto adoption levels.The results show that Bitcoin (BTC) and the second-most valued cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), have been losing their market shares in terms of the composition of crypto owners, while the number of users holding other digital assets has been steadily growing.The study also found that a massive surge in crypto users this year came alongside some notable growth in the popularity of altcoins or cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. According to Crypto.com’s findings, the altcoin adoption was likely spurred by the influx of new users interested in altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Token (SHIB) amid Elon Musk’s criticism of BTC mining over its alleged environmental harm.Related: Crypto usage in Turkey increased elevenfold in a year, new survey showsCrypto.com’s latest crypto population study comes after the company released the first-ever edition on measuring global crypto users in May 2020.

35,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $40,000 on July 29, a day after the Federal Reserve hinted that it was getting nearer to unwinding its asset purchasing program that has boosted the economic recovery of the United States.The benchmark cryptocurrency previously approached $41,000 ahead of the critical Fed update. Nonetheless, it started losing upside momentum after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released its policy statement, followed by a press conference helmed by the Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell.As economists expected, Fed officials left their monetary policy unchanged at the end of their two-day policy meeting. They noted that the U.S. economy has advanced higher toward its maximum employment and inflation goals and that the Fed would continue to evaluate its stimulus policy in the coming months.Bitcoin investors have been closely monitoring how soon the central bank might unwind its $120-billion-per-month bond-buying program. That is partly because of the benchmark cryptocurrency's bull run from $4,000 to $65,000 against the Fed's loose monetary policies.Powell had earlier said that the Fed's asset purchases would continue until it sees ""substantial further progress"" in the U.S. economic recovery.But July 28's press conference was the first time the Fed had to explain what it sees as ""substantial further progress."" CNBC's Steve Liesman put the question before Powell, who responded that it means strong labor numbers and progress toward maximum employment.Follow-up questions by reporters pressed Powell into explaining what ""transitory"" means, a term he and his office had repeatedly used in their previous FOMC statements to sideline concerns about rising inflation in the United States. Powell took at least two minutes to address the sudden line of inquiry, noting that inflation will rise in the short term but won't rise year-over-year.Scott Skyrm, executive vice president of fixed income and repo at Curvature Securities, noted that the FOMC statement mentioned the term ""inflation"" or ""price stability"" 10 times. That shows that rising consumer prices are in the back of the Fed officials' minds, even though they refute its presence by resorting to the word ""transitory.""Lyn Alden Schwartzer, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, said Powell was trying to admit that inflation is not transitory in absolute terms — i.e., the Fed chair accepted that its ongoing policies would lead to ""permanent significant price increases."" She added:Alden's statements took cues from one of her recent newsletters. In it, she noted that the year-over-year inflation wobbled between highs and lows, thereby appearing transitory (the first chart below). Still, since the consumer prices remained at a permanently higher plateau after each inflationary spike, inflation kept rising (as shown in the second chart below).Skyrm noted that Powell's style of looking at ""substantial further progress"" as only maximum employment while completely sidelining inflation fears mean the Fed's tapering would respond to improved labor data not soaring consumer prices.Therefore, if the Delta variant of COVID-19 leads to another round of lockdowns, followed by more stimulus and unemployment benefits, one may not see normalization in the jobs market. That would mean more inflation in the times ahead.The take-away here isn’t about inflation. It’s how government regulation can distort the transmission of monetary policy. https://t.co/4gy3PhnEKS""I suspect that many may agree that this was one of the most confusing Fed press conferences,"" said Mohamed El-Arian, chief economic adviser at Allianz.Bitcoin has slid below $40,000 once more at time of publishing.

36,"Bitcoin (BTC) futures open interest is mimicking the start of the BTC price bull run, data shows.As BTC/USD hovered near $40,000 on Thursday, a fresh bullish report from Stack Funds called for “cautious optimism” about further price rises.Bitcoin has sought to flip $40,000 to support this week, returning to the level multiple times and refusing to leave recent gains as a blow-off top.According to its latest weekly market appraisal, however, Stack Funds believes that it is derivatives that are giving stronger hints about potential bullish price continuation.Bitcoin open interest is currently exhibiting the style of increase that characterized Q4 last year — the springboard for current $64,500 all-time highs.“Those who wanted to accumulate lower might have missed out on the large swings, but fret not; re-adjusting your entry levels could reap you a more significant return on the bigger picture of this super cycle,” the report states.This Friday, meanwhile, sees the end-of-month expiry event for Bitcoin options, something that — at least in theory — allows for a release of potential selling pressure thereafter.Stack continued that given recent events, regardless of short-term price strength, a return to fresh lows near previous all-time highs of $20,000 was “less likely.”Related: Bitcoin fails to flip $40K with traders eyeing $36K or lower for supportOn the flipside, resistance bands as yet untouched remain a dark cloud on the immediate horizon for bulls.“There are also several major resistances ahead; such as the $41,000 resistance level, which coincides with July’s 1.618 Fib, and also the $45,000 daily 200MA level,” the firm added.Order book data from major exchange Binance highlighted a high resistance band concentration in the area above $41,000."

The sudden disappearance of Bitcoin miners from the grid has resulted in falling hash rates. The hashing performance, the cumulative computing power of the Bitcoin network, dropped from an all-time high of 180 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 84 EH/s in just 21 days.While the hash rate drop was directly attributable to the drop in the number of Chinese miners, Blockchain.com Explorer data suggests there has been a steady increase in mining difficulty since June 3. Since the drop, the hash rate has increased by 21.38%, owing to the return of the migrating Chinese miners that have started operating in other regions. The resulting adjustment in Bitcoin mining difficulty translates into higher computational costs. As more of the formerly China-based miners come back online, the operational costs for Bitcoin miners worldwide will continue to increase.Given the initial resistance from the Chinese government, miners have been on the lookout for countries that offers both regulatory clarity and lower electricity costs.Related: How to mine Bitcoin: Everything you need to knowUnder the pretext of shielding citizens from high-risk investments, Chinese authorities have forced crypto businesses to highly limit their crypto portfolio offerings or move offshore. As reported by Cointelegraph earlier this month, Wang Juana, a member of China’s OECD Blockchain Expert Policy Advisory Board, stated:At its peak in September 2019, China contributed to 75.53% of the global Bitcoin hash rate and had shown a steady decline way before the mining ban was imposed. While China’s current hash rate contribution stands at 46.04%, the United States has expanded its share to 16.85% globally. Cointelegraph also covered instances where jurisdictions including Russia, Kazakhstan and Canada have seen greater involvement in crypto by offering a home for the migrating Chinese miners. As many experts agree, China’s shattered monopoly over the mining industry signals a positive move toward the decentralization of the crypto ecosystem."
38,"A group of Russian experts is working on a new blockchain-based service to allow users to bequeath their cryptocurrency holdings and digital rights to the next generation.The National Technological Initiative (NTI), a global technical leadership program in Russia, announced a new digital inheritance tool based on blockchain technology, local news agency RIA Novosti reported Tuesday.The initiative brings together experts from three local universities, including Lomonosov Moscow State University, the National Research Nuclear University and the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.Dubbed “Time Capsule,” the service would allow users to store digital data and assets like social media passwords and Bitcoin wallet keys, according to the NTI. The service would also allow the transfer of other digital possessions like images, texts, videos, or location coordinates, NTI representatives reportedly noted.Project manager Dmitry Izvekov said that the working group is now building a website that would allow users to store their digital possessions in encrypted form before the data is ready to be transferred to specified persons only on the specified date. The transfer of this information is only available if certain conditions are met, effective not earlier than six months after the data was uploaded on the website, Izvekov added.According to the report, the expert group plans to store the encrypted digital inheritance data on SberCloud, a cloud-based service run by state-owned Sber (formerly known as Sberbank), the largest bank in Russia.Users would be able to duplicate the data over cloud services like DropBox, the report notes. The project creators reportedly intend to raise up to 3 million rubles ($40,000) to finance the initiative, expecting to monetize the platform as soon as it grows more popular and to offer additional services.Related: Russian central bank policies stop Tinkoff from offering crypto trading, CEO saysDespite Sber’s cloud-based platform reportedly being expected to be involved in storing digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) as part of the project, Russia's largest bank is not a big fan of the cryptocurrency, at least within the country. Last month, Sberbank CEO Herman Gref argued that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are probably the riskiest type of investment alongside the equity market. As reported, Sber previously planned to set up a cryptocurrency exchange through its Swiss subsidiary in January 2018."
39,"The Israeli government is ratcheting up its efforts to deter tax evasion and close loopholes for would-be money launderers as part of a “war against black capital.” Among the measures outlined in a new draft bill published by the Ministry of Finance this week, a new statutory requirement is being proposed to place cryptocurrency users under increased scrutiny.The proposed law would make it mandatory for cryptocurrency users who have either purchased 200,000 Israeli shekels ($61,000) worth of cryptocurrency or whose crypto holdings are currently worth the same amount and above to file a report with the Israeli tax authorities.This reporting obligation would apply to any Israeli citizen who has held, personally or on behalf of a child under 18, cryptocurrency worth this amount or above on one or more days of the tax year. The bill states that:If approved, the introduction of this measure would raise state revenues by an estimated 30 million shekels ($9.2 million) in 2022 through additional tax.According to a report from Israeli business newspaper TheMarker, Meni Rosenfeld, chairman of the Israeli Bitcoin Association, wrote a letter to Israeli Tax Authority head Eran Yaacov earlier this week. He argued that the extensive reporting obligation would create a database of Bitcoin (BTC) holders — something unprecedented compared with any other asset.Rosenfeld further argued that due to the price volatility of digital assets, crypto investors could qualify for a reporting obligation one month and then soon after falling below the threshold. He wrote that the decision to hastily make this amendment to the law without any dialogue nor understanding of its implications drastically impairs investors’ rights to a hearing and compromises the effectiveness of the proposed legislation. Related: Israeli defense minister authorizes seizure of Hamas-tied crypto accountsIsraeli daily Globes also cited Rosenfeld’s objection that the law would unduly discriminate against Bitcoin holders, as well as frame them as “potential criminals.” In his view, the proposed measures go against the grain of easing access to the digital economy more broadly, a market that already faces significant regulatory challenges.Tax lawyer Itay Bracha told Globes the law was “another aggressive step taken by the authorities towards becoming a ‘Big Brother.’ The decision makes it clear that the state does not trust taxpayers to report and pay what they properly owe.” Bracha also noted that reporting obligations are not mandatory in Israel for investors who trade stocks or other assets, despite the classificatory equivalence between them and cryptocurrencies."
40,"Bitcoin (BTC) demanded a $40,000 resistance flip on Thursday as on-chain data revealed large withdrawals from exchanges.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD rise to challenge the upper end of its trading range once more on Thursday.The pair had seen a pullback after initially hitting multi-week highs of $40,600 on Bitstamp earlier in the week.Bottoming out at $38,800, Bitcoin then returned for its latest trip to the $40,000 mark, with that level still to be flipped to support convincingly at the time of writing.Amid concerns over the strength of this week’s rally, data on Thursday nonetheless pointed to genuine demand for BTC at higher prices.Shared by Bybt and CryptoQuant, the data appeared to show the largest one-day outflow in at least a year. A total of 57,000 BTC left exchanges in 24 hours.With that, exchange balances returned to levels last seen in mid-May, just before a major price correction after Bitcoin began reversing from all-time highs of $64,500.Despite this demand, however, market participants remained convinced of the need for a higher low construction on BTC/USD before any higher levels could fall.Related: Bears scattered as Bitcoin hit $40K, but pro traders remain cautious“I think market needs to go down to put in a HL before continuing up,” popular Twitter trader Pentoshi summarized.Exactly how low that higher low will be could be anywhere between $36,000 and $32,500, Cointelegraph reported.Order book data from major exchange Binance, meanwhile, confirmed a narrowing range for spot price, with buyers and sellers encroaching on $40,000 from both sides."

In the July 28 announcement it added that it has previously facilitated a number of real estate transactions that used BTC as the form of payment.Glen Oaks Escrow, which started accepting Bitcoin payments in 2018, views the transaction as proof that Bitcoin’s value proposition is becoming clearer to debtors and creditors. Company Chief Operating Officer Joe Curtis commented:He added that seeing the lender rather than the home buyer using BTC in a real estate transaction “tells us that this technology has the potential to continue becoming more prominent, even if it is still considered new to our industry.”In another crypto related real estate development, a Dogecoin aficionado from the U.S. state of Utah has offered a 10% discount on his property if the buyer pays in DOGE.On July 27, a local TV station reported that the owner listed the $389,000 home for sale and will accept seven cryptocurrencies but prefers Dogecoin due to his belief the 10% discount would quickly be made up for by Dogecoin price appreciation. After applying the discount, the amount of DOGE required to make the purchase would be around 1.7 million tokens at current prices.Way back in 2017, Cointelegraph reported on the first-ever BTC real estate transaction which occurred in Texas.Related: 5 Cities That Let You Buy Real Estate with BitcoinThese two new stories are the latest positive developments in the real estate sector.

FNTX Capital Suisse partnered with Portugal-based property developer 355 Developments to offer condos for crypto in the capital, Lisbon."
43,"Bitcoin (BTC) traders might be feeling extra euphoric after the recent 35% rally, but data suggests bears are not too worried because a similar breakout took place in mid-July and the price failed to hold the $40,000 support.To understand how bullish investors are this time around, let's take apart the derivatives data and look at the futures contracts premium and options skew. Typically, these indicators reveal how professional traders are pricing the odds of a potential retrace to $36,000.Even though the pattern isn't exactly similar, Bitcoin crashed to $31,000 on June 8 and bounced to $41,000 six days later. The 32% rally caused $1.4 billion BTC short contracts liquidation that spread over the week. Bears were clearly not expecting this move, but in less than three days, Bitcoin was trading below $38,000 and initiated a downtrend.Therefore, bulls have reasons to doubt the current rally's sustainability, considering there haven't been any significant changes to justify the $40,000 level. Moreover, the price could be suppressed by the ongoing FUD regarding miners' exodus from China and Binance moving to seek regulatory approval.One of the best measures of professional traders' optimism is the futures market's premium because it measures the gap between monthly contracts and the current spot market levels. In healthy markets, a 5% to 15% annualized premium is expected. However, a backwardation scenario occurs during bearish markets, and the indicator fades or turns negative.According to the chart above, the one-month futures contract has been unable to recover an annualized premium above 5%. Some periods of backwardation happened over the last month, although the current level is deemed neutral.To exclude externalities specific to the futures' instrument, one should also analyze options markets.Related: $60K is now more likely for Bitcoin than $20K, Bloomberg's senior strategist assertsWhenever market makers and professional traders lean bullish, they will demand a higher premium on call options. Such a trend will cause a negative 25% delta skew indicator.On the other hand, whenever the downside protection is more costly, the skew indicator will become positive.When the figure oscillates between negative 10% and positive 10%, the indicator is deemed neutral. The 25% delta skew indicator had been signaling 'fear' between May 14 and July 24.However, even the recent rally to $40,000 wasn't enough to flip the sentiment towards 'greed,' as the indicator remains neutral at negative 4%.According to both derivatives metrics, there is absolutely no sign of bullishness from professional traders. The 35% price hike might have eliminated a recent pattern of fear, but it was not enough to flip the sentiment.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

44,"Bitcoin (BTC) and most major altcoins are attempting to break above their respective overhead resistance levels, indicating the return of the bulls.Data from Bybt shows that the Grayscale premium has been climbing and reached -5.88% on July 27, its closest level to zero since May 25. This suggests that institutional investors may have again started building positions via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Another institutional investment product showing a possible return of buyers is Canada’s Purpose Bitcoin ETF whose assets under management rose to 1.1 billion Canadian dollars on July 27, its highest level since May 13.Swiss private bank Vontobel said in its half-year financial report that its Bitcoin tracker certificate investment product had generated significant interest from clients. Vontobel CEO Zeno Staub said to Bloomberg that its wealthy clients have allocated a part of their wealth to cryptocurrencies.Horizon Kinetics co-founder Peter Doyle also told the Financial Times that the world economy is at an inflection point because of the pandemic and mounting debt. This “means either default or currency debasement.” Therefore, Doyle said people should have exposure to cryptocurrencies.With institutional interest returning to Bitcoin, could the rally continue or will bears again stall the recovery near overhead resistance levels? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin’s long wick on the July 26 candlestick shows that bears aggressively sold near $40,550 but the positive sign is that bulls flipped the $36,670 level into support on July 27. This indicates a possible change in sentiment from sell on rallies to buy on dips.The bulls pushed the price above $40,550 today but the wick on today’s candlestick suggests that bears have not yet surrendered. They will again try to stall the recovery in the overhead resistance zone at $41,330 to $42,451.67.If the price turns down from the current level or the overhead zone, the BTC/USDT pair could again drop to $36,670. A strong bounce off this level will suggest that bulls are not waiting for a sharper dip to get in.The pair could then consolidate between $36,670 and $42,451.67 for the next few days, improving the prospects of a break above the range. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen into the overbought zone, indicating that bulls are back in the game.This positive view will invalidate if the price breaks below the moving averages. That will bring the large range between $42,451.67 and $28,805 into play.Ether (ETH) turned down from the downtrend line on July 26 but the bears could not sink and sustain the price below the moving averages. This suggests that bulls are buying on minor dips.The moving averages are close to completing a bullish crossover and the RSI has risen into the positive zone, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. If bulls drive the price above the downtrend line, the momentum may pick up. That could open the doors for a possible rally to $3,000.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and dips below the moving averages, the ETH/USDT pair could gradually drop to the critical support at $1,728.74.The long wick on the July 26 candlestick suggests that bears sold at higher levels. They attempted to trap the aggressive bulls by pulling Binance Coin (BNB) back below the downtrend line but the buyers did not relent.The bulls defended the 20-day exponential moving average ($304) on July 27 and are attempting to push the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($312) today. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $340.A breakout and close above $340 will clear the path for a possible rally to $400 and then to $433. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could result in a fall to $254.52.The long wick on Cardano’s (ADA) July 26 candlestick suggests that traders are selling on rallies. The bears tried to pull and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($1.25) on July 27 but failed, indicating buying at lower levels.This may have reinvigorated the buyers who are again trying to push the price above the 50-day SMA ($1.33). If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could gradually rise to $1.50. This level may pose a stiff challenge for buyers but if they can overcome it, the pair could start its northward journey toward $1.94.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and slides below $1.20, it will indicate that bears continue to sell at every higher level. That may result in a retest of the critical support at $1.Although bears successfully defended the 50-day SMA ($0.67) on July 26, they could not pull XRP back below the 20-day EMA ($0.62). This suggests that bulls are accumulating on dips.Sustained buying from the bulls today has pushed the XRP/USDT pair above the 50-day SMA for the first time since May 19. If buyers can clear the hurdle at $0.75, the pair will complete a double bottom pattern. This setup has a target objective at $1.The 20-day EMA is attempting to turn up and the RSI has risen above 62, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $0.75, the bears will again try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair may extend its consolidation between $0.50 and $0.75 for a few more days.The long wick on Dogecoin’s (DOGE) July 26 candlestick suggests that bears are defending the 50-day SMA ($0.23) aggressively. The sellers attempted to sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.20) on July 27 but failed.This suggests that buyers have not given up and will make one more attempt to push the price above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could start a relief rally that may reach $0.28 and then $0.33.On the contrary, if the price again turns down from the 50-day SMA, several short-term traders may close their position. That could result in a break below the 20-day EMA, which may clear the path for a decline to $0.15.The bears attempted to sink Polkadot (DOT) below the $13 support on July 27 but failed, which suggests that bulls are accumulating at lower levels.The buyers will now try to push the price toward the overhead resistance at $16.93. This level may again act as stiff resistance but the flat 20-day EMA ($13.95) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that sellers may be losing their grip.If bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA during the next correction, the prospects of a break above $16.93 will improve. That could signal the start of a sustained relief rally to $20 and later to $26.50.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $13. That could result in a retest of $10.37.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from the downtrend line on July 26, indicating that bears are aggressively defending this resistance. Although the price broke below the 20-day EMA ($18.25) on July 27, the bulls bought this dip.The buyers will now again attempt to push the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, it will invalidate the developing bearish descending triangle pattern. The failure of a bearish setup is a bullish sign as aggressive bears are forced to cover their short positions.That could open the doors for a possible rally to $24 and then to the critical overhead resistance at $30. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and plummets below $17.24, the UNI/USDT pair could start its downward journey toward $13.Related: Ethereum pares gains, Bitcoin pushed under $40K as Fed set to reveal tapering plansBitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the 50-day SMA ($504) on July 26 but the bulls defended the 20-day EMA ($471) on July 27. This suggests a tough tussle between the bulls and the bears.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen into the positive territory, indicating that bulls are attempting to make a comeback. A breakout and close above $546.83 will signal the start of a sustained relief rally as the BCH/USDT pair will complete a double bottom pattern.This up-move could face stiff resistance at $650.35 but if crossed, the rally could reach the pattern target at $710.13. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the pair could extend its range-bound action for a few more days.Litecoin (LTC) turned down from the 50-day SMA ($138) on July 26 but the positive sign is that bulls did not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($128).The bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance in the overhead zone between the 50-day SMA and $146.54. If the price turns down from this zone and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.On the other hand, if bulls drive the price above $146.54, the LTC/USDT pair will complete a double bottom pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective of $189.25. The RSI above 57 and the flat 20-day EMA points to a marginal advantage to buyers.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

As a result, Powell said in his congressional testimony earlier this month that the central bank would continue its $120-billion-a-month bond-purchasing program, raising concerns that it could cause further inflationary spikes, especially in the housing sector.Brian O’Reilly, head of market strategy for Mediolanum International Funds, noted that there are no signs of inflation cooling down in the sessions ahead, so the Fed might just start looking into the rising consumer prices, if not putting a pause on its bond-buying program. He added:The Ether and Bitcoin markets’ biggest vulnerability is that their valuations may not be sustained without expanding liquidity from the Fed.Related: Bitcoin bull outlines 7 steps to more fiscal stimulus and higher BTC pricesMeanwhile, the strong underpinning is that there is substantial capital sitting on the sidelines waiting to enter the market, with a DataTrek Research report noting that retail investors on Robinhood alone hold $400 billion to enter markets on the next big dip. Fred’s Retail Money Fund also notes that retail investors hold over $1 trillion versus $643 billion in 2015.“We live in an unprecedented time of fiscal and monetary stimulus,” noted Anthony Pompliano, a prominent crypto advocate and a partner at Pomp Investments, in one of his recent notes to clients. He added that investors would do so much better while putting money in financial instruments than holding cash or negative-yielding assets. He said:Given 20% of the American public know BTC well enough to hold it, and at current growth rates, shitting on #Bitcoin will be political suicide in the next few years.Tim Frost, CEO of DeFi wealth management platform Yield App, weighed concerns over analysts’ renewed upside outlook for Ether and Bitcoin.He told Cointelegraph that the markets could resume their downtrend following “a brief rally,” wherein Bitcoin falls to as low as $20,000, taking Ether lower alongside.

49,"Bitcoin (BTC) saw tough resistance after nearing $41,000 on July 28 amid calls for consolidation of recent gains.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD pulling back below the $40,000 mark as Wednesday progressed. The pair had begun with a fresh surge which took it towards heavy range resistance but ultimately lacked the momentum to change its existing paradigm.At the time of writing, Bitcoin focused on $39,500, having dipped to lows of $39,300.For Cointelegraph contributor Michael van de Poppe, a retracement was not only welcome but essential for cementing new higher levels - and the prospect of a further breakout.Bitcoin, he said on Wednesday, needed to close out a higher low.""What you want to see after such a move is the price is going to make a higher low, and preferably you want to see it happen in the range around $34,500,"" he explained, noting that this was previously an area of interest.  Either side of that level for higher low constructions were $32,500 and $36,000, he added.Adopting a cautiously bullish short-term view, crypto trading company QCP Capital meanwhile acknowledged that the range ceiling ($42,000) would be unlikely to shift prior to Friday's options expiry event.""Technical analysis aside, our sense is that the market will keep looking to trade within this 30-40k range in the near-term,"" the firm told Telegram channel subsrcibers.A further topic on traders' lips on Wednesday concerned a longer-term phenomenon: the so-called ""golden cross.""Related: GBTC premium matches Bitcoin price crash levels as unlocking fear fadesFormed by the rising 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average, a golden cross is the opposite of a death cross, a feature which sparked considerable debate when it entered the BTC/USD chart in mid-June.Now, thanks to this week's price uptick, the possibility of a golden cross and its associated bullish implications were ""not insignificant,"" Van de Poppe said, while arguing that as a feature, it has little importance to the market overall.Fellow trader and analyst Rekt Capital likewise entertained the golden cross narrative, forecasting its fulfilment as soon as next month.#BTC's fantastic recovery continues

50,"Bitcoin (BTC) returned to $40,000 on Wednesday as bulls and bears waged a tug-of-war for hard-won higher ground.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $40,200 overnight, sealing a rare eight straight green daily candles in a row.Investors had been initially skeptical of the strength of the initial rally, which began Monday, after a snap surge past the $40,000 mark followed by a roughly 9% correction.For Sam Trabucco, a qualitative crypto trader at Alameda Research, such behavior was of little surprise, based on previous rallies, but the next few days should be tense.“A lot can happen from here — BTC has had a stock beta, so there’s potential for it to remain sorta beholden to that, and there has historically been ‘round number resistance’ maybe causing it to struggle staying >$40k,” he concluded in a series of tweets on Wednesday.His predictions came as shorts nonetheless remained low on major exchange Bitfinex on the day — earlier this month, sudden increases had noticeably influenced short-term price pressure.Examining buy and sell levels on major exchange Binance, meanwhile, showed $38,500 growing as Bitcoin’s nearest support level, with $41,000 likewise hardening as resistance.For better or worse, this week’s price action has had a sizeable impact on market sentiment.Related: GBTC premium matches Bitcoin price crash levels as unlocking fear fadesAccording to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, fear has all but drained from the mindset of market participants, with its measure gauge reaching 50, or “neutral” territory, for the first time since the May BTC price crash.The Index has doubled in just two days, and last week scored just 10/100, corresponding to market sentiment of “extreme fear.”There could nonetheless be room to grow — April’s all-time highs were accompanied by an “extreme greed” score of 95/100."
51,"Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes, continues its efforts to maintain dialogue with global regulators by introducing withdrawal limits and a new tax reporting system.The company officially announced Tuesday a major update to its Know Your Customer policies, significantly reducing maximum withdrawal amounts for users who have not completed full identity verification.Effective immediately for new Binance accounts, users who have completed only basic account verifications will be unable to withdraw more than 0.06 Bitcoin (BTC) per day, worth roughly $2,400 at the time of writing. Previously, the maximum daily withdrawal amount was capped at 2 BTC, or about $80,000, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao noted on Twitter.According to the announcement, Binance will continue applying new withdrawal limits for existing users in phases starting from Aug. 4. The exchange expects to have adopted new withdrawal restrictions entirely by Aug. 23. Binance users who have completed full identity verification will be still able to withdraw up to 100 BTC in a day, or nearly $4 million at BTC prices at the time of writing. “Withdrawal limits refresh daily at 00:00 AM,” the announcement notes.Binance also rolled out its new tax reporting tool on Wednesday. The reporting system is an Application Programming Interface that enables Binance users to track their crypto transactions, transfer their transaction history to third-party vendors, and obtain instant overviews of their local tax liabilities. The new initiative is part of the exchange’s broader strategy to expand user protection and risk management protocols.Related: Binance CEO wants to 'work with regulators' as the exchange expandsAccording to Binance’s tax reporting instruction page, users can now select a third-party tax tool to transfer their transaction history. “Binance is not endorsing any particular third-party tax tool software. Please exercise your own discretion and/or consult your personal tax adviser based on your personal tax circumstances and requirements when selecting the third-party tax tools,” the exchange warned.Binance did not immediately respond to a request for information on the usage of the new tool for Binance US users.The news comes amid Binance aggressively adopting new trading restrictions in an apparent effort to respond to the ongoing global regulatory crackdown on the exchange. This week, the exchange delisted margin trading pairs for three fiat currencies, including the euro, the Australian dollar and the British pound sterling. Binance’s futures trading platform has also started reducing maximum leverage positions from 125x to 20x.Zhao also hinted Tuesday that he might be willing to step down as CEO should someone “with a strong regulatory background” be available. “There are no immediate plans to replace me as CEO,” he noted."
52,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility made headlines again after the original cryptocurrency briefly reclaimed its $40,000 mark before going back to $39,000 levels. Coming after a two-week-long bearish loom that started on July 15, this is the second time Bitcoin is trying to break $40,000 resistance in as many days. Based on the data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, BTC witnessed a bull run for trading pair BTC/USD from 21 July that resulted in a spike of 34.13% in just seven days. The crypto community attributes the rising BTC price directly to the increased involvement of traditional banks and entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk and Michael Saylor. This week, Amazon’s rumored involvement in crypto also pushed the price, although the tech giant later denied those rumors.While the current price indicators suggest that Bitcoin may stick to its ongoing support of the $30,000–$40,000 mark, BTC is yet to see a positive change of $20,000 before it can reach its former glory of $60,000.What may seem like a good indication, the sudden push to exit an immediate resistance does not accompany the $30,000 corridor. By the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is closing in on $39,500.Related: Bitcoin price seeks higher low as trader forecasts $45K breakout within weeksIn a recent survey conducted by CNBC on a group of portfolio managers and equity strategists, 44% of the respondents felt that Bitcoin’s price would fall down below $30,000.

53,"The world’s second-largest crypto asset has gained ground on Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of trading volume growth during the first half of this year according to a new report.Ether’s trading volume grew faster than Bitcoin’s in the first half of this year, according to a new report from leading American crypto exchange Coinbase.The Coinbase Institutional “H1 2021 in Review” report, released on Monday, acknowledged that the first half of this year has been one of the most active periods on record for crypto, with several new all-time highs in prices, user adoption and trading activity.Taking data from 20 exchanges across the globe, the report revealed that the trading volume for Bitcoin reached $2.1 trillion for the period, up 489% from $356 billion over the first half of last year.Ether’s (ETH) total trading volume reached $1.4 trillion, but its growth was much faster, up 1,461% from $92 billion in the first half of 2020. Coinbase remarked that it has been the first sustained period of time ever that Ether’s trading pace exceeded Bitcoin’s.The research also measured total crypto market capitalization, which began the year at $769 billion, peaked at $2.4 trillion in May, and ended the period at $1.4 trillion, registering a net gain of 86% year to date.Related: Ethereum has strong fundamentals, so why are pro traders bearish on ETH?It noted that the bulk of BTC’s gains came during Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 before the crypto asset’s price declined in Q2 2021. It is currently trading down 38.8% from its April 13 all-time high of $65,899.Ether, on the other hand, saw the majority of its gains in Q2 2021 when it doubled in price to reach an all-time high of $4,357 on May 12. However, it has retreated an even deeper 47.4% to current levels.The second-most valuable crypto asset appreciated 895% over the 12-month period and 210% over the six-month period ending June 30. Coinbase attributed a number of factors to this including increased usage in decentralized finance, investor optimism in the network’s transition to proof-of-stake, and the rise of layer-two scaling solutions for the network.In January, Cointelegraph predicted that Ether will become the main asset for investors in 2021. Both BTC and ETH have rallied over the past week, gaining 32.4% and 27.7%, respectively, according to CoinGecko."
54,"The wider cryptocurrency market entered a period of consolidation on Tuesday following Bitcoin’s (BTC) brief spike above $40,000 the day before, which helped ignite a rally across the market and brought a renewed sense of optimism to the market. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that a mid-day attempt by bulls to lift the price of BTC back above the $40,000 level was rejected, resulting in a price pullback to $37,500.While Tuesday’s price pullback may suggest that Monday’s rally was simply a short squeeze, others point to the rising Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) premium, which is now at its highest levels in months at -5.88%, suggesting that institutions are once again betting on more BTC price upside. Rumors that Amazon will begin accepting cryptocurrency payments in 2021 helped ignite the market-wide rally seen on Monday, though it was officially denied by the company later on. However, as pointed out by pseudonymous independent market analyst Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s price chart shows a fractal pattern that is similar to the price-performance in October 2020 — just before BTC’s price began its run to a new all-time high.When was the last time #BTC broke beyond the 50-day EMA resistance?

He also believes that it will attract investments and create new jobs.However, the Bitcoin Law has raised multiple concerns. Skeptics say the cryptocurrency's high volatility could pose a threat to the country’s financial stability. A very low internet penetration rate, along with a lack of education about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency within the country, could also prevent Bitcoin from reaching widespread adoption in El Salvador.To boost Bitcoin adoption, President Bukele has promised to build the necessary infrastructure. This includes 1,500 Bitcoin ATMs and a government wallet meant to guarantee instant conversions of Bitcoin into dollars.Will that be enough for Bukele’s monetary experiment to succeed?

56,"The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is echoing bullish sentiment in Bitcoin (BTC) as its premium over spot price rises to its highest since May.Data from analytics resource Bybt shows that on Tuesday, the so-called Grayscale premium stood at -5.88%. The last time it was closer to zero was on May 25.That was a week after Bitcoin began a major price drawdown, which this week has finally shown signs of abating.GBTC has been the subject of intense speculation since Bitcoin’s 55% price dip, with unlocking of GBTC shares allegedly capable of adding to selling pressure.As Cointelegraph reported, such a premise is false by default, given restrictions in place on GBTC holders.Nonetheless, interest in purchasing has resurfaced this month in particular, with conspicuous names adding to their tranche and increasing their Bitcoin exposure.The Grayscale premium — the trading price of GBTC relative to the net asset value (NAV) of its BTC holdings — has increased in step, trending back to zero after an extended stay in negative territory.With unlockings mostly complete, the narrative surrounding Bitcoin price suppression has all but disappeared.“$GBTC premium has gone from -15% to -5% in 5 days,” trader and analyst Nick Hellmann commented on the latest changes.Despite mixed perceptions over GBTC, one figure decidedly not at all bearish on any timeframe is Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein.In the company’s latest mid-year shareholder letter, Sonnenshein reiterated previous public statements about his intent to turn GBTC, along with its altcoin-focused equivalents, into exchange-traded funds (ETF).“We are 100% committed to converting Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (symbol: GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (symbol: ETHE), and our other investment products into ETFs,” the letter reads.With the United States yet to approve a single Bitcoin ETF, neighboring Canada, which gave the green light to the first player, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, has never looked back.On Tuesday, Purpose’s assets under management jumped from $900 million Canadian dollars to $1.1 billion CAD — its highest since May 13."
57,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded steadily on Tuesday after a surge above $40,000 resulted in higher levels broadly holding.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hovering near $37,000, around 8.8% below the peak of Monday’s gains.Its first trip above $40,000 in six weeks, Bitcoin price action is now attempting to consolidate and form support at a higher low, Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe said.“Bitcoin rejects at the range high, which isn't strange,” he explained in a Twitter update Tuesday.A look at buy and sell levels on major exchange Binance confirmed the significance of those price points, with buyer support significantly in evidence only below $36,000. Sellers, on the other hand, remained clustered at $40,000 and above.The area immediately after $40,000 remains a decisive hurdle to overcome for Bitcoin bulls, with analysts arguing that doing so would unleash the bull market continuation that so many continue to wait for.“Did people really expect 45-48k in one day?” popular trader Pentoshi reasoned.That scenario would place BTC/USD on track to reach $47,000 in August, the minimum — if controversial — monthly close predicted by stock-to-flow model creator PlanB.Bitcoin’s comedown from local highs, meanwhile, spelled problems for altcoins.Related: Price analysis 7/26: BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, XRP, DOGE, DOT, UNI, BCH, LTCEther (ETH), the largest altcoin by market capitalization, dipped 11% following a copycat move to highs of its own at $2,432 on Bitstamp.Many major altcoins fared likewise, with 24-hour losses of 10% or more not uncommon at the time of writing.“The great part is that altcoins are following suit with Bitcoin and will most likely run towards their other side of the range too,” van de Poppe nonetheless added in a hopeful forecast, repeating previous conviction about the altcoin market."

61,"Bull market optimism returned to the cryptocurrency market on Monday after Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rallied above the $40,000 level for the first time in over six weeks.Monday’s rally to $40,581 was a continuation of Sunday’s breakout that saw BTC’s price rocket to $48,110 on Binance after a short squeeze resulted in nearly $500 million in shorts being liquidated in just two minutes. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTC spiked to an intraday high at $40,581 on Monday before pulling back to $37,500 as bulls looked to flip this resistance zone back to support in preparation for a further move higher.While the move higher has the mark of a trend change and has prompted some analysts to proclaim the bull market is back on track, on-chain data and the perpetual funding rates do not fully concur with this point of view — especially when one considers that the current breakout may have only been the result of a massive short squeeze.According to Élie Le Rest, partner at digital asset management firm ExoAlpha, the recently denied rumor that Amazon would accept cryptocurrency payments have the potential to have a similar effect as the 2020 revelation from PayPal that it would integrate cryptocurrencies. Le Rest said that if the Amazon news turns out to be true, this “could be the catalyst to ignite a bull run in H2 of 2021.”As Bitcoin’s price pushed above the $35,000 level on Sunday, “more than a billion dollars of shorts got liquidated in the past 24 hours, with the bulk of the liquidation occurring in less than 1 hour,” according to Le Rest, who also said, “the current market move could be sustained during the week by volumes coming from players having waited for a more directional trend on Bitcoin since the end of May.”Le Rest continued:If Bitcoin is able to maintain its current momentum, Le Rest said, “as many expect, Bitcoin could get back on track with the Stock to Flow model and reach the $100,000 mark by year-end.”Caution is warranted against being overly bullish, and data from Glassnode suggests that several bearish threats remain valid. When analyzing the directional bias of the futures markets, Glassnode found that “perpetual funding rates have continued to trade negative,” which “indicates the net bias remains short Bitcoin.”Glassnode said:Glassnode also pointed to Bitcoin’s on-chain activity and highlighted that “in direct contrast to the volatility in spot and derivatives markets, the transaction volume and on-chain activity remains extremely quiet.”Overall, how on-chain transfer volume responds to the recent price action in Bitcoin will provide better insight into where the market is headed, but as noted by Glassnode, “it remains to be seen whether on-chain volumes start to pick up in response to recent volatile price-action.”Related: DeFi tokens book double-digit gains after Bitcoin rallies above $39,000Bitcoin’s recovery above $40,000 also helped spark strong rallies in most altcoins.Ether (ETH) gained 11% to hit a daily high at $2,433, while Dogecoin (DOGE) posted a 7% gain to trade at $0.208.Other notable gainers include a 64% gain for Strike (STRK), a 55% rally in Venus (XVS), a 20% breakout in VeChain Thor (VTHO) and Ankr (ANKR).The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.46 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 47.4%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

62,"Bitcoin (BTC) touched $40,370 on July 26 as a solid day of gains saw the return of a major price milestone. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD touching $40,400 before consolidating nearby later in the day.The pair had held on to previous gains from the night before throughout the day, circling $38,000 before another surge took hold after the the Wall Street open.Amid some understandable excitement from investors who had waited for upside to finally resume, Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe cautioned against being overly bullish at current levels.""Bitcoin still showing strength, although sentiment is getting euphoric again while approaching the range resistance,"" he wrote just before $40,000 hit.That would mark an exit from a long-established trading range that has been in place for over two months.

63,"Bitcoin (BTC) soared from $29,482.61 on July 21 to $40,000 today, its highest level since June 16. This sharp rebound shows a possible change in sentiment. The bulls received a boost on Sunday, following the news from an anonymous source within Amazon proclaiming that the company is planning to accept Bitcoin payments by the end of 2021 and is exploring the launch of its own cryptocurrency by 2022.This news seems to have sent the bears scurrying to the exit, resulting in a short squeeze. Data from Bybt shows about $1.1 billion of liquidations in 24-hours on Monday, the most since May 18. The intensity of the squeeze was such that “$111,000,000 of shorts liquidated in 10 minutes” according to analyst William Clemente III.Although institutional adoption of digital assets is on the rise, some still view crypto only as a speculative asset. Man Group CEO Luke Ellis said that cryptocurrencies are “a pure trading instrument” with “no inherent worth in it whatsoever. It is a tulip bulb.”Can the bullish sentiment sustain and attract further buyers? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical levels on the upside and the downside.Bitcoin closed above the 50-day simple moving average ($34,396) on July 25, which may have forced the short-term traders to cover their short positions. This could have resulted in a short squeeze today, pushing the price above the overhead resistance at $36,670.The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen close to the overbought territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand.If buyers sustain the price above $36,670, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the overhead resistance zone at $41,330 to $42,451.67 where they may encounter stiff resistance from the bears.If bulls arrest the subsequent decline above $36,670, the pair could trade in the upper half of the large trading range between $30,000 to $42,451.67. A break above $42,451.67 will signal the possible start of a new uptrend.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. If that happens, the pair could retest the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone.Ether (ETH) struggled near the $2,200 level for the past two days but the long tail on the July 25 candlestick suggests that bulls purchased the dip. Sustained buying by the bulls has pushed the price above the $2,200 level today.The ETH/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line, which may again act as a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this resistance but rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($2,081), it will indicate a change in sentiment. That will improve the prospects of a break above the downtrend line.A breakout and close above the downtrend line will clear the path for a possible rally to the psychological resistance at $3,000. This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the bears have not given up and continue to sell on rallies.The bulls have pushed Binance Coin (BNB) above the downtrend line and are now attempting to clear the hurdle at the 50-day SMA ($314).The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen into the positive territory, indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback. If they can sustain the price above the 50-day SMA, the BNB/USDT pair may soar to $380 and later to $433.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to sink the pair back below $280. If they manage to do that, the pair could continue its down move and retest the July 20 low at $254.52.The long tail on Cardano’s (ADA) candlestick on July 25 showed that bulls were buying the dips rather than closing their positions near the 20-day EMA ($1.24). The momentum picked up today and bulls have propelled the price above the moving averages.If bulls sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($1.34), the ADA/USDT pair could rise to the downtrend line. This level could act as stiff resistance but if the bulls arrest the next decline above the 20-day EMA, it will enhance the prospects of a break above the downtrend line.If that happens, the pair could rally to $1.63 and then to $1.88. On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level and slides below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $1.14 and then to $1.XRP’s rebound had stalled near the 20-day EMA ($0.61) for the past three days but the bulls did not dump their positions. Renewed buying has pushed the price above the 20-day EMA today.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen above 54, indicating that bears are losing their grip. If bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.68), the XRP/USDT pair could rise to $0.75.A breakout and close above $0.75 will complete a double bottom pattern, which could open the doors for a rally to $1.07. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the pair could again drop to the critical support at $0.50.Although bears defended the 20-day EMA ($0.20) for the past three days, the bulls did not give up much ground. This suggests that bulls were not booking profits as they were anticipating Dogecoin’s (DOGE) relief rally to continue.The buyers have pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $0.21 today but the bears may not give up easily. The sellers will again try to stall the recovery at the 50-day SMA ($0.24). If the price turns down from this level, the bulls will attempt to flip $0.21 into support.If they succeed, the possibility of a break above the 50-day SMA increases. Such a move could open the doors for a likely rally to $0.28 and then to $0.33. Conversely, if bears pull the price below the 20-day EMA, the DOGE/USDT pair could again drop to $0.15.The bears tried to stall Polkadot’s (DOT) relief rally at the 20-day EMA ($13.92) for the past three days but they could not pull the price back below the $13 level. This shows that bulls were buying on every minor dip.The bulls have pushed the price above the 20-day EMA today and the DOT/USDT pair could now rally to the overhead resistance at $16.93. This level may act as stiff resistance and if the price turns down from it, the pair could again drop to $13.On the contrary, if bulls drive the price above $16.93, it will suggest that the markets have rejected the lower levels. The pair could then start its northward march to $20 and later to the stiff overhead resistance at $26.50.Uniswap’s (UNI) recovery has reached the downtrend line of the descending triangle pattern where bears may mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this level and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($18.17), it will suggest that bears are aggressively selling at higher levels.The RSI has climbed into the positive territory and the 20-day EMA has flattened out, suggesting that the selling pressure is reducing. If bulls push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the bearish pattern will be invalidated.That could attract further buying, opening the doors for a rally to $25. If bulls can clear this hurdle, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to $30 where bears may pose a stiff challenge.Related: Here’s how much Musk and Saylor’s tweets influenced crypto prices in Q2After struggling near the 20-day EMA ($465) for the past two days, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has resumed its recovery today. The altcoin could now rise to the overhead resistance at $538.11 where the bears may mount a stiff resistance.The RSI has risen above 55 and the 20-day EMA has flattened out, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. A breakout and close above $538.11 will tilt the advantage in favor of the bulls as the BCH/USDT pair will complete a double bottom pattern.This bullish setup has a target objective at $706.22. Alternatively, if the price turns down from $538.11, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to push the price above the overhead resistance. A break below the 20-day EMA could pull the price to $370.The bears attempted to stall Litecoin’s (LTC) relief rally near the 20-day EMA ($127) for the past two days but the bulls were in no mood to relent. They held their ground and pushed the price above the 20-day EMA today.The RSI has risen into the positive zone and the 20-day EMA has flattened out, indicating that bears are losing their grip. If bulls drive and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($139), the LTC/USDT pair could attempt a rally to $180.If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA but does not break below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips. The bears will have to sink the price below the 20-day EMA to gain the upper hand.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

64,"A renewed sense of optimism has returned to the cryptocurrency ecosystem on July 26 as Bitcoin’s (BTC) recovery above $38,900 has sparked a market-wide rally in the altcoins. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the top movers over the past 24 hours are Amp (AMP), Venus (XVS) and Reserve Rights (RSR).Five out of the top seven gainers fall into the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, a possible sign that DeFi may be heating up for another major run in 2021.The top performer over the past 24-hours has been Amp (AMP), a digital collateral token protocol that offers instant, verifiable assurances for any kind of value transfer.Data from TradingView shows that after hitting a low of $0.048 on July 25, the price of AMP rallied 96% to reach an intraday high at $0.094 on July 26 as its 24-hour trading volume jumped more than 800% from an average of $20 million to $280 million.Venus (XVS), a Binance Smart Chain-based algorithmic money market and synthetic stablecoin protocol also saw a strong breakout today.As seen in the chart above, the price of XVS has spiked 63% from a low of $17.13 on July 25 to an intraday high at $27.95 on July 26 as its 24-hour trading volume surged by more than 600% to $180 million.According to the latest data provided by Venus, the protocol currently has more than $3 billion in total value locked on the platform and over $1.8 billion in available liquidity.The third-biggest gainer on Monday was Reserve Rights (RSR), a dual-token stablecoin platform comprised of the Reserve stablecoin (RSV), which is backed by a basket of assets managed by smart contracts and the RSR token which helps to keep the price of RSV stable through a system of arbitrage opportunities.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for RSR on July 24, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for RSR turned green on July 24 and climbed to a high of 76, around 28 hours before its price increased by 45% over the next day.The jump in price follows the July 24 upgrade to the protocol which now allows app users to “deposit and withdraw money on Saturdays and Sundays from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm.”The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

65,"Lending has been around in some form for thousands of years — dating back to ancient civilizations where farmers would borrow seeds and use crops as repayment.The arrival of fiat currencies transformed the way economies were run back then. Indeed, you could argue that we’re seeing such a seismic shift now as cryptocurrencies become a larger and more influential part of the world’s financial ecosystem.When done right, crypto lending has the potential to level the playing field — giving consumers a type of flexibility that they may otherwise have been unaccustomed to. For several years now, the rates offered by banks have been tepid to say the least. In some countries, even the most generous savings accounts will only pay less than 1% interest — even if funds are locked up for several years.Given how inflation has been rising sharply recently, in part because of the money printing performed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, signing up for one of these accounts means a saver’s money would actually command less spending power down the line.Crypto lending offers three powerful advantages compared with the status quo. First, it is possible to find more competitive deals that ensure capital actually grows — with interest sometimes paid on a weekly or a monthly basis. Second, many platforms offer a much-needed degree of flexibility to lenders, meaning that they won’t be forced to lock up their money for long periods of time and can withdraw their funds at will. And third, it can act as a powerful incentive when markets are behaving rather erratically.That’s before we’ve even discussed the fact that crypto as collateral can be far more practical from a lender’s point of view than real estate — an asset that is rather illiquid and can be rather time consuming to sell.Of course, all of this sounds like a good deal for lenders — the people who have capital to spare. But it can also be beneficial for borrowers, too. In the current financial ecosystem, where a single blemish on an otherwise impeccable credit history can deny a responsible consumer access to the best interest rates, crypto platforms can offer an invaluable lifeline.Banks often have an opaque list of requirements when it comes to finding the people they are willing to extend credit to. And, in a world where ever-increasing numbers of consumers are self-employed, otherwise creditworthy applicants can end up being excluded from the market simply because they don’t have a traditional nine-to-five job — irrespective of whether they actually earn more money in their current arrangement.The crypto world can help to foster inclusivity here, but there are challenges. A number of lenders in this space are offshore and unregulated — something that can make them less appealing to everyday consumers. This also restricts the number of partnerships that crypto platforms can enter into with fintech firms.One platform that is aiming to shake up the world of lending is Baanx, a crypto-as-a-service fintech intending to bridge the worlds of crypto and fiat. The company allows brands to offer interest-free forms of secured lending to their customers and communities, alongside high savings rates for those who stake their digital assets. This is all achieved via APIs that can be rapidly integrated into any DeFi, exchange, or wallet’s app or website.This form of interest free and low cost secured lending is provided to those who stake BXX, the utility coin that’s associated with Baanx. Loans can subsequently be moved into crypto wallets or physical and virtual cards. For those who use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral, loan-to-value ratios of up to 50% are available, and approval can be achieved in one click.Baanx is on the list of temporarily registered cryptoasset businesses with the FCA and also utilizes a lending license. The project’s whitepaper states that it will “lend against any digital asset including cryptos, stocks, bonds and the emerging NFT asset class.”The volumes of money that can be offered through lending will depend on the volumes of tokens that are staked within its system.Figures provided by Baanx suggest that the platform now has sold more than 600,000 white-label cards and accounts around the world — almost exclusively through branded corporate clients, including Tezos Crypto Life app, DeFi protocols, exchanges, and wallet providers. It is also planning to launch with a major wallet provider in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2021.BXX is now listed on MEXC and Uniswap.Disclaimer.

66,"Texas, the second-largest state in the U.S. known for its southern hospitality, is embracing the droves of Bitcoin (BTC) miners that have recently flocked to the region. Following China’s crackdown on crypto mining that occurred in May, a number of Bitcoin mining companies have relocated to The Lone Star State to conduct business. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, though. Texas could very well be the ideal location for Bitcoin mining, due to obvious reasons such as its deregulated power grid, increasing renewable energy and political leaders that are publicly pro-crypto. Texas Governor Greg Abbot recently tweeted his excitement about how Texas is becoming the next “crypto leader,” with the recent addition of cryptocurrency kiosks available in grocery stores.Yet, while all of these elements make Texas appealing to Bitcoin miners looking to set up shop, rural communities seeking economic growth have become another less discussed feature that is luring mining companies to Texas.Chad Harris, chief executive officer of Whinstone Inc. – the operator of the largest crypto facility in North America that was recently acquired by Riot Blockchain – told Cointelegraph that his team came to Rockdale, Texas to build Whinstone after reading an article in Wired Magazine detailing the failure of China’s Bitmain mining facility in that very location in 2019:While the abundance of wind and the deregulated power grid in Texas have helped the company grow, Harris also attributes a good deal of Whinstone’s success to Rockdale — a small city in Milam County with a population of close to 6,000 people.And although it may not be obvious, Harris shared that the largest benefit for Whinstone, next to the cost of power in Texas, has been the state’s workforce. “Whinstone is unique from other mining companies because we have our own staff consisting of 120 employees, all with paid healthcare and 401k benefits."" He added, ""We also use Texas employee incentives and send our workers to Texas’ Temple College to train and get certified in areas like construction, human resources and more.”Overall, Texas consists of 254 counties, ranging in population from more than 4 million people to some areas with just over 100 people. While the State of Texas provides a number of local development programs to boost the economy in certain communities, the influx of crypto mining companies is making a real impact.For example, Milam Country Judge Steve Young told Cointelegraph that Whinstone has become an integral part of Rockdale and Milam County. He explained, “Whinstone has made a concentrated effort to be a part of the community by being involved in local activities.” Young further noted that Harris and the Whinstone founding team came to Milam County with little funds, but with courage and determination, they put together the largest Bitcoin mining operation in North America.While Whinstone may have been one of the first Bitcoin mining facilities to have accomplished this, others are following suit. Peter Wall, CEO of Argo Blockchain, told Cointelegraph that Argo has broken ground on a highly anticipated renewable energy-focused 200-megawatt cryptocurrency mining facility in Dickens County, Texas.Wall noted that Argo has initially been interested in mining crypto in West Texas due to the abundant nearby renewables, allowing Argo to have the ability to host renewable generation at the site. “As there is no local load, we’re improving the economics for renewable generators in the area and allowing for even more renewable development,” Wall commented.Equally as important, Wall explained that Dickens County is a “Qualified Opportunity Zone,” meaning that the region is a distressed community experiencing difficult economic conditions. Wall elaborated:According to Wall, establishing Argo’s mining operations will serve as a huge growth opportunity for both Argo and the community of Dickens County. Wall shared that Argo’s facility is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022. In addition to building in West Texas, Argo has also begun applying for an initial public offering in the United States.Joining the ranks of Whinstone and Argo, Bitcoin Mining operations giant Core Scientific told Cointelegraph that it’s set to acquire Blockcap, a BTC mining company headquartered in Austin, Texas. Core Scientific is also set for a public listing on Nasdaq soon.Darin Feinstein, co-founder of Core Scientific, a blockchain infrastructure company, told Cointelegraph that the company was drawn to Texas for all the practical reasons including the vast amounts of land, renewable energy and sustainable sources. However, the Texas community was also a major factor for Core Scientific to expand its operations to Texas.Feinstein noted that Texas Governor Abbot has created a “world class business friendly environment that not only encourages entrepreneurialism and technology, but has been welcoming to the blockchain industry.” According to Feinstein, crypto friendly leaders like Governor Abbot are necessary to deploy capital behind.This is an important point, considering the amount of capital the Bitcoin mining business requires. For example, the Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimated that one BItcoin transaction takes 1,720 kWh to complete, which is equivalent to almost 59 days of power for the average U.S. household. “A crypto mining facility requires a lot of capital and you have to make good choices when it comes to business partners and long-term growth,” said Harris.With long-term success in mind, The Lone Star State’s electricity operator — the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT — has started to pay Whinstone for an agreement to stop buying power during heightened energy demand, which typically occurs during overly hot Texas summers. Harris explained:Even with its welcoming environment and seemingly abundant natural resources, major Bitcoin mining companies currently coming to Texas are bound to face new challenges that have been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic.According to Harris, the biggest challenge the crypto mining industry currently faces is commodities shortages. “Commodities like transformers, wires and other parts are really difficult to acquire now. We were ahead of the game and started ordering supplies 6-8 months ago to expand Whinstone this summer. We ordered everything last October.""The Federal Reserve’s latest Beige Book survey found that businesses were blaming COVID-19 disruptions in production and supply chain logistics as the reason for commodities shortages and price spikes for things like agricultural products and building materials. “Delivery for products on pre-engineered buildings are coming in 32 weeks instead of 14 weeks. Big transformers in substations take 64 weeks to arrive. Every company that wants to build a crypto mining facility today will have a delivery material problem,” remarked Harris.Related: A green revolution in crypto mining? Industry answers wake-up callAlthough this is the case, it’s important to note that cryptocurrency mining is still largely decentralized. As such, major Bitcoin mining facilities are not the only players contributing to the Bitcoin hash rate. In fact, data shows that the hash rate distribution is increasingly in favor of small, anonymous miners.Moreover, large mining companies have also benefited from China’s ban on Bitcoin mining. Sam Tabar, chief strategy officer at Bit Digital — a publicly-listed miner — told Cointelegraph that China’s Bitcoin mining ban resulted in an unintended gift to the United States. “Now, the mecca of Bitcoin generation has moved from China to North America, along with massive capital investment, energy innovation and jobs.”"
67,"Elon Musk and Michael Saylor played a significant role in shaping crypto investor sentiment during the second quarter, underscoring just how nascent digital asset investing remains when compared with other, more established markets. Sentiment-driven analysis from The TIE and eToro USA reveals the extent to which Musk and Saylor impacted Bitcoin (BTC) values in the second quarter. The results were presented in eToro USA’s quarterly report, titled “The True Value of Influence.”On average, Musk’s Bitcoin tweets were followed by a 1.6% decline in BTC’s price over the proceeding 24 hours, the report showed. However, Musk’s Bitcoin-focused tweets positively affected investor sentiment and contributed to a 44.4% surge in BTC-related tweet volume.The researchers identified three occasions where Musk’s Bitcoin-related tweets were associated with an even bigger drop in price. On May 16, his tweet on the centralization of mining was associated with a 7.6% decline in Bitcoin’s price over the next 24 hours.Bitcoin is actually highly centralized, with supermajority controlled by handful of big mining (aka hashing) companies.

A single coal mine in Xinjiang flooded, almost killing miners, and Bitcoin hash rate dropped 35%. Sound “decentralized” to you?https://t.co/Oom8yzGRNQHis May 12 tweet regarding Bitcoin’s fossil fuel usage likely contributed to BTC falling 9.4% over the same period. Finally, on May 20, Musk’s claim that global Bitcoin mining exceeds the energy usage of some medium-sized countries preceded an 11.3% decline in the BTC price over 24 hours.Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.Musk earned the scorn of the Bitcoin community when he said Tesla would no longer accept BTC payments due to environmental concerns. The Tesla CEO appeared to have walked back those comments last week when he said Bitcoin miners may have already hit his benchmark on renewable energy.Related: SpaceX owns Bitcoin, Elon Musk and Nic Carter believe BTC is becoming greenerThe tweets of MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor also appear to have influenced Bitcoin’s price, but in the opposite direction. As The TIE and eToro USA explain:On average, in the 24 hours following Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused tweets, the price increased by 4.4%, investment sentiment fell by 0.8%, and tweet volume jumped 4.1%.The MicroStrategy CEO is convinced that Bitcoin is the “apex” achievement of humanity, describing it as a “cure” for civilization-destroying inflation. Entities under his direct control have amassed more than 111,000 BTC since mid-2020.#Inflation is a cancer that has been killing civilizations throughout history. #Bitcoin is the cure. https://t.co/nmj753S8fjIn a recent poll, Saylor asked his 1.3 million Twitter followers how long they think Bitcoin will last. Of the more than 105,000 people who participated in the poll, nearly 38% said they believe Bitcoin would last 10,000 years.#Bitcoin will lastRelated: Michael Saylor doesn’t think Bitcoin is ‘going to be currency in the US ever’The report also highlighted the growing impact of YouTubers on the cryptocurrency market. ""Just as influencers are well known to stimulate engagement in the consumer product and fashion industries, popular social media personalities do the same with crypto assets and protocols for both users, traders and investors,"" the researchers said. In particular, the report singled out Bitboy Crypto, a channel with over 1.1 million followers, as having one of the most engaged audiences in the industry. Channels like Coin Bureau, Altcoin Daily and Sheldon Evans were also cited for their substantial growth during the bull market. "
68,"William Cai, co-founder of investment firm Wilshire Phoenix, is the latest person to cast doubts on the possibility of a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the United States in 2021.Speaking to Business Insider, Cai remarked that a Bitcoin ETF in 2021 is unlikely as he offered 2022 and 2023 as the earliest possible times for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to greenlight a BTC ETF.Several Bitcoin ETF hopefuls currently have filings with the SEC, including fund management outfit Global X, which submitted earlier in July.The SEC has thus far elected to delay its decision on the pending ETF submission, and Cai expects the commission to deny these applications, stating, “We think they are all going to get stuck.”Cai has some experience with the SEC’s handling of Bitcoin ETF applications. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the commission rejected Wilshire Phoenix’s Bitcoin ETF filing in February 2020, much to the company’s disappointment.According to Cai, despite the changing of the guard at the SEC’s leadership with Gary Gensler as the new chairman, the commission’s stance on Bitcoin ETFs remains the same. “I’ve seen nothing that suggests there’s been a switch in their thinking,” Cai added.As part of the interview, the Wilshire Phoenix co-founder stated that price manipulation remains a major concern for the SEC.Related: Osprey Funds CEO says US will approve Bitcoin ETF in 2022 ‘at earliest’Cai is not the only person to cast doubts on a Bitcoin ETF happening in 2021. In June, Greg King, CEO of Bitcoin trust issuer Osprey Funds, marked 2022 as the earliest estimate for an SEC-approved BTC ETF.At the time, King stated that Bitcoin ETFs were not high on the list of priorities for the SEC. Cai also offered the same argument, telling Insider that the commission was focused on regulating meme stock, environmental, social and governance compliance, and the Robinhood initial public offering."
69,"Not all hedge fund managers are sold on crypto as Man Group CEO Luke Ellis has compared cryptocurrencies to tulip bulbs.Speaking to the Financial Times, Ellis remarked that the utility of crypto comes from its volatility, thus presenting the asset class as a viable trading opportunity. According to the CEO of the world’s largest publicly-traded hedge fund:Despite being an outmoded comparison, crypto and Bitcoin (BTC), in particular, are often compared to the “Tulipmania” — a brief period where the price of some tulip bulbs soared exponentially in the Netherlands before eventually crashing.Ellis stated that his $127-billion hedge fund is happy to trade crypto, as there is liquidity to support long or short bets, given the choppy price action of cryptocurrencies. For Ellis, Man Group’s crypto involvement does not constitute an endorsement of the cryptocurrencies as an asset class.According to the Man Group CEO, the hedge fund does not offer crypto as an “asset management product,” but it is one of the over 800 markets, in which the company trades.Commenting on the prevailing crypto investment thesis, Ellis identified inflation as a major reason why cryptocurrencies are becoming more popular within asset portfolios.Indeed, Bitcoin proponents say BTC offers a hedge against inflation and monetary debasement, especially amid the current economic recovery efforts across the globe to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.Related: Hedge funds see the crypto market decline as an investment opportunityEllis’ comments come as more hedge funds are becoming active in the crypto investment space. Back in June, Cointelegraph reported that United States-base hedge fund managers expect to hold over 10% of their assets in crypto.Bitcoin and the crypto market dipping over 50% since May has been identified as an investment opportunity for big-money players in anticipation of a return to parabolic price movements by the end of the year."
70,"Alongside cryptocurrency’s decade-long adoption drive, the momentum behind the installation of crypto ATMs continues across the globe. Based on Coin ATM Radar’s latest data, crypto ATM installations in 2021 have witnessed a spike of 71.73%, pulling up the numbers from 13,993 on Jan. 1 to 24,030 at the time of reporting. Last year, the global count rose to 13,993 ATMs with a 119.56% growth after 7,620 new machines were installed. So far, 2021 has seen the installation of 10,037 ATMs. To keep things in perspective, data suggests that crypto ATMs are being installed at a speed of roughly 52.3 ATMs per day.The United States currently leads this space, having installed nearly 48 ATMs per day, based on the data acquired in the last seven days. As reported by Cointelegraph back in March, the ATM count in the U.S. rose to 177% in just a year, standing at 16,835.Crypto ATMs can be accessed across 75 sovereign nations and are powered by 42 producers. Coin ATM Radar’s data on the manufacturers also suggests that Genesis Coin dominates this space with 40.9% market share, while General Bytes owns around 24% of the market. The remaining 35% of the market is shared among other players, including BitAccess, Coinsource and Bitstop.Related: Circle K convenience stores will host thousands of crypto ATMsOne of the largest holders of the Bitcoin (BTC) ATM network, Bitcoin Depot, recently announced a partnership with Circle K to install crypto ATMs across the U.S. and Canada. The partnership has since resulted in the installation of more than 700 Bitcoin ATMs.Bitcoin Depot operates over 3,500 crypto ATMs allowing users in the U.S. and Canada to purchase over 30 types of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC)."
71,"Bitcoin (BTC) maximalist and Ballet CEO Bobby Lee recently discussed the implications of China’s ongoing crackdown on cryptocurrency. Despite the government’s support for a digital renminbi, Lee suggested that Beijing has no interest in nurturing the cryptocurrency industry. Considering his collisions with the Chinese government during his stint in running China’s first crypto exchange, BTCChina, Lee said:He further stated that the Chinese government is not looking after the vast crypto exosystem that exists in the region. Stressing on the wait-and-see approach, Lee highlighted that 2017 marked the start of increased regulatory scrutiny and at this pace, “I do fear that in 4–5 years, the country might outright ban it (cryptocurrency).”The government’s recent ban on crypto mining and related trading seems to be aimed at deterring citizens from getting heavily involved in high-risk investments, given the boom in trading volumes. Adding to this thought, Lee said:Bitcoin’s decentralized global network has led Lee to believe that China’s stance in accepting or banning cryptocurrency will not affect the Bitcoin or crypto market in the long run. To help viewers make sense of Elon Musk’s recent move toward Bitcoin adoption at Tesla, the seasoned entrepreneur hopes to see more Fortune 500 companies in 2021 add more Bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings to their current portfolio. Lee believes that the final straw at this moment would be banning cryptocurrency and Bitcoin altogether. But considering the involvement of mainstream businesses along with ever-increasing government initiatives, China continues to restrict its in-house crypto business operations while allowing individuals to hold and trade Bitcoin.Related: FTX reduces max leverage from 101x to 20x to encourage ‘responsible trading’Owing to China’s recent crypto regulations against risky trading, crypto businesses have started taking proactive steps to stay relevant in the ecosystem. As per Cointelegraph’s recent report related to this development, FTX announced to limit its trading leverage to 20x, which was previously standing at 101x."
72,"Bitcoin (BTC) is nearing $40,000 this Monday as a new week gets underway with a bang for bulls.A calm but confident weekend culminated in a dramatic run-up overnight Sunday, with BTC/USD swiftly nearing the top of its multi-month trading range.With favorable fundamentals and a lot of liquidated bears, Bitcoin looks set to investigate levels not seen in several weeks.What could shape price action as the week continues? Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors to consider when charting BTC price action in the coming days.Spot price action is, naturally, the topic on everyone’s radar at present — in 24 hours, Bitcoin has sealed gains of nearly 15%.While not yet flipping $40,000 to resistance, current levels have not been around since mid June, and appetite for bullishness is palpable.It began slowly following last week’s “The ₿ Word” conference, which featured praise of Bitcoin from the likes of Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk.A breakout was not immediately apparent, however, and progress was slow, as analysts remained wary of a market that they thought could still easily collapse to new cycle lows.In the event, however, Bitcoin slowly inched up through the week, taking out $34,500 over the weekend and opening up the prospect of a run higher.An impulse move was widely anticipated, including by Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe, with potential targets lying within the established medium-term range with $42,000 as its ceiling.On Monday, however, even van de Poppe appeared taken aback by the veracity of the move higher, calling it a “surprise.”“After such a move of Bitcoin, altcoins will follow suit,” he predicted on Twitter.Fellow trader Crypto Ed was more cautious. Highlighting Elliott Wave analysis, he argued that even a return of the bull market would not be without its sticking points and that $29,000 could still return after $42,000 in line with his previous predictions.For those who follow Elliott Wave: technically spoken, the move to new lows is still possible as long as we don't break white 2.
But based on the lower TF labelling of this impulsive move, I'd expect a break above 2 and invalidating the move ot 26-27k

Now, equities are treading water over headwinds from China, while Bitcoin soars.A crackdown from Beijing has overshadowed previous strength in United States markets, and this combined with increasing worries over inflation and central bank stimulus tapering makes for a shaky mood, an analyst told Bloomberg Monday.“The second half of the year is going to be this glass half-full, half-empty context,” Virginie Maisonneuve, global chief investment officer for equity at Allianz Global Investors, told the publication’s TV network.As Crypto Ed continues to stress, meanwhile, the strength of the U.S. dollar is also worth paying attention to in the short term. Currently still on a rebound, the USD currency index (DXY) is expected to hit local highs around the 94 mark before falling again — this latter move giving Bitcoin some real breathing space.Until then, however, DXY could ultimately pressure cryptocurrency markets.“Expecting DXY to drop more in coming days, BTC should see more relief bounce because of that,” he said Thursday alongside an accompanying chart.Is up always good? Not if you’re short BTC.As commentators were already suggesting recently while BTC/USD was still close to $30,000, the “maximum pain” scenario would likely not be fresh losses, but rather a dramatic reversal to the upside.That is exactly what happened — the 15% overnight gains took a serious toll on those market participants who were convinced that a crash was incoming.According to monitoring resource Bybt, 24-hour liquidations totaled $1.1 billion on Monday, the most since May 18. “$111,000,000 of shorts liquidated in 10 minutes,” analyst William Clemente III added, citing further data from analytics firm Glassnode.It’s far from the first time that bears have been caught unaware — the nature of Bitcoin has ensured time and time again that those who are overly negative ultimately get pushed out.A recovery in Bitcoin fundamentals, which has been underway much longer than price, continues unabated this week.The hash rate is approaching 100 exahashes per second (EH/s) again, a positive sign that has been accompanied by increasing decentralization of the hash rate overall.Gains have been brisk over the past week when the hash rate was still lingering near local lows of 83 EH/s. At its height before the price drawdown in May, the hash rate reached 168 EH/s.A similar story is apparent in network difficulty, which at the time of writing is forecast to increase by around 3.7% at the next readjustment in five days’ time.If it happens, it will be the first positive difficulty change since May’s mining rout, and a strong signal that the effects of the accompanying upheaval have been mitigated.While dubious, the concept of Bitcoin’s “eco-friendliness” remains an important topic, with large miners leveraging the narrative to reassure skeptical markets of Bitcoin’s longevity.The statistics speak for themselves — renewable and sustainable energy is increasingly powering the Bitcoin network as miners relocate to suitable jurisdictions.Those worried that the price gains may be a case of “too much too soon” can take heart in the relatively calm sentiment that has accompanied them.Related: Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, ETH, ICP, AAVE, LUNAAccording to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, the shift toward $40,000 has not changed the overall market mood based on “fear.”On Monday, the Index measured 26/100 — signaling fear, rather than greed or a “neutral” atmosphere — with the implication that Bitcoin could rise further without investors feeling overly greedy and apt to spark a sell-off.“Bitcoin fear and greed index has been under 40 for over 2 months — the longest ever time period,” Danny Scott, CEO of exchange CoinCorner, noted last week.The past months have seen “extreme fear” reign, meanwhile, a trait that recently also characterized traditional markets."
73,"A retirement investment platform for small businesses has launched the Alt401(k) — enabling mainstream investors to include cryptocurrencies in their portfolios.ForUsAll has entered into a partnership with Coinbase Institutional to provide this service — and through this 401(k), employees can transfer up to 5% of their balances into a secured account where they can buy cryptocurrencies directly.Overall, nearly 40 different cryptocurrencies are supported, and employees get portfolio monitoring tools and the education required to make them feel comfortable with this asset class.According to ForUsAll, over 60% of professional investors now say crypto has a role to play in their portfolios — and academic research also suggests that holding up to 5% of crypto in a diversified portfolio can increase expected growth without materially increasing risk.In a recent report, the company’s CEO Jeff Schulte described the 401(k) as one of the best (and most counter-intuitive) places to invest in digital currencies. The fact it’s counter-intuitive mainly lies in how complicated it has been to add crypto to one of these portfolios… until now.Stressing that ForUsAll is designed to facilitate responsible financial planning, rather than offer high levels of risk for those saving for their retirement, Schulte added:“Now, on the subject of crypto, I’m definitely NOT talking about ‘going all-in’like those reality TV poker shows. It may be appropriate to hold between 0 and 5% as part of a well diversified portfolio.”The reason why a 401(k) is so beneficial for those who intend to seek a small amount of exposure to cryptocurrency lies in how 401(k)s enable investors to use after-tax money (Roth contributions) to buy, sell, hold and withdraw cryptocurrencies without paying any tax on the gains that are accrued.Setting out how things work, Schulte examined a $5,000 initial investment that would have been made in March 2020. One year later, that sum would have been worth $67,315. Investing in a 401(k) would mean that balance was untouched — but in a traditional retail setting, U.S. consumers would have had to pay taxes of $21,810 at sale, leaving them with a remaining balance of just $45,505.Speaking to Cointelegraph, ForUsAll said: “The financial world has changed but the 401(k) has not kept up. We wanted to help average Americans have the same access as institutional and professional investors.”“Once we began looking carefully at the risk/return trade-offs, it became clearer why so many professional investors were incorporating it into their portfolio, so we asked ourselves, how can we make this available to the little guy? How do we make this work in a 401(k)?”MORE INSIGHTS FROM FORUSALLA first stepForUsAll says that it is the first in the industry to introduce digital assets in the 401(k) — and that it firmly believes the merging of these worlds means that more Americans will have access to this alternative investment.The company adds that this is only a first step, and plans are in place to open doors to a range of other alternative investments that have, until now, been largely only available for institutional investors.Reports have suggested that the likes of Harvard, Brown and Yale have all allocated part of their institutional portfolios to digital currencies.This is likely on the basis of studies that suggest that, when included in a diversified portfolio, digital currencies offer greater growth potential without a material increase in risk.Given how retirement portfolios may need to sustain investors for 20 years or more in their retirement, increasing growth potential without assuming greater levels of risk can only be a good thing.Learn more about ForUsAllDisclaimer.

74,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has surged more than 10% over just a few hours earlier today, with prices quickly surging from roughly $35,000 to tag just shy of $40,000 on Monday.Price action shows a violent short squeeze that occurred as prices broke above $35,000, with bullish momentum suddenly accelerating as prices quickly rallied 15% from roughly $34,000 to $39,800 over the course of less than three hours.And folks, we have our squeeze. https://t.co/Lflcp7MZuwBy contrast, BTC had taken the past five days to gain from roughly $30,000 to $34,000. As of this writing, Bitcoin is changing hands for roughly $38,500.According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is the top gainer for the past 24 hours among the top 30 crypto assets by capitalization, posting a gain of nearly 13%.The sudden rally has seen numerous technical indicators return to offering bullish signals, with popular analyst Lark Davis informing his 426,000 followers that BTC’s price is again trending above its 50-day moving average.Oooohhhh..... #bitcoin just reclaimed the 50 day moving average! Nice! pic.twitter.com/xpS3kiUV16Polkadot’s DOT and Chainlink’s LINK are also among the day’s top gainers, each having increased by more than 11% in the past 24 hours.With Dogecoin (DOGE) up less than 9% for the day, it would appear the impact of Elon Musk’s Twitter account on the meme coin’s markets is beginning to wane, with Tesla’s CEO posting a meme asserting that “Dogecoin is money” on Sunday.Despite Musk’s efforts, Dogecoin appears to have moved in lock-step with the broader altcoin markets, with most large-cap crypto assets having posted high single-digit gains for the day.#bitcoin is moneyRelated: Bitcoin price hints at 'megaphone' bottom pattern, and a breakout toward $40KDespite next month’s fast-approaching London upgrades for Ethereum, Ether (ETH) is also lagging behind the pack, posting a gain of roughly 7% for the past 24 hours. As such, ETH is the weakest-performing cryptocurrency ranked among the top 10 by capitalization for the past day."
75,"Cryptocurrency adoption is growing in Singapore, especially among younger generations looking to capitalize on the generational wealth potential of Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets, according to the inaugural 2021 Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index, or IRCI, a survey conducted by Asia-Pacific cryptocurrency exchange Independent Reserve. The survey, which is based on a poll of 1,000 Singaporeans from a representative background of gender, age and location, revealed that 43% of the polled respondents said they owned cryptocurrency, with 46% planning to buy digital assets in the next 12 months. Two-thirds, or 66%, of respondents in the 26 to 45 age bracket said they owned cryptocurrencies.Unsurprisingly, 93% of the polled said they have heard of Bitcoin. Nearly 40% of respondents described BTC as an “investment asset” and 25% called it a “store of value” or “digital gold.”Among those aged 26 to 35, three-quarters said they believe cryptocurrencies will become widely accepted by individuals and businesses. These attitudes reflect Singapore’s positive embrace of digital assets across multiple segments of society. As Cointelegraph recently reported, financial authorities in Singapore confirmed they are working with their French counterparts to explore cross-border applications of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs.Related: Countries representing over 90% of global GDP are exploring CBDCsThe Monetary Authority of Singapore, the citystate’s central bank, has even offered citizens cash prizes to submit their digital currency ideas.Adrian Przelozny, the CEO of Independent Reserve, described Singapore as a ""key hub in Asia due to its robust and well-regulated financial markets infrastructure and openness to new technologies.""Raks Sondhi, managing director of Independent Reserve, further explained Singapore's advantages in an email to Cointelegraph: A spokesperson for the exchange told Cointelegraph that Singaporeans appear to be much further ahead of the adoption curve when compared with other nations. Case in point: The exchange released an independent study of Australia in 2020 that showed a cryptocurrency ownership rate of 18.6%. Overall, Singapore scored 63 in the IRCI on a scale of 1 to 100, compared with 47 for Australia in 2020.Related: Singapore’s DBS Bank launches digital bond security token"
76,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recovery is facing stiff resistance near the $35,000 mark but Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone remains bullish. In his latest analysis, McGlone said that the probability of Bitcoin hitting $60,000 is greater than the price dropping to $20,000.Institutional investors seem to be using the weakness in Bitcoin to build their positions. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest added more than 450,000 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in two separate buys in the past week, increasing their holdings to more than 9 million shares. In addition, Edge Wealth Management and Rothschild Investment Corp also added GBTC shares to their portfolio.However, not everyone is so bullish on Bitcoin. Analysts at Delphi Digital have pointed out that Bitcoin is testing the support at the 12-month moving average and a break below it could result in further downside. Kevin Kelly, a certified financial analyst at Delphi Digital, said a break below $30,000 could prove to be bearish for Bitcoin.If Bitcoin remains range-bound, traders are likely to shift their focus on select altcoins, which may surprise to the upside. Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may continue to attract buying interest in the short term.Bitcoin rallied and closed above the 20-day exponential moving average ($32,974) on July 23, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($34,301).If buyers succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could challenge the critical short-term resistance at $36,670. A breakout of this resistance could attract further buying, clearing the path for a possible rally to the $41,330 to $42,451.67 resistance zone.The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen above 54, indicating a minor advantage to the bulls.If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA but rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned bullish. The buyers will then make one more attempt to clear the hurdle at the 50-day SMA.Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate that bears continue to sell at higher levels. The pair could then retest the support at $31,000.The 4-hour chart shows that bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance near $35,000. The pair could now drop to the 20-EMA where buyers are likely to step in. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the short-term sentiment has turned bullish.The buyers will then again try to clear the hurdle at $35,000. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $36,670 where bears may again pose a still challenge. If the bulls do not give up much ground from this resistance, it will suggest that short-term traders are not booking profits at this level.This will improve the likelihood of a break above $36,670. This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA.Ether (ETH) reached the 50-day SMA ($2,165), which is likely to act as a strong hurdle because the bears had stalled the previous rally at this resistance on July 7.If the price turns down from the current level but finds support at the 20-day EMA ($2,046), it will suggest that the sentiment has turned bullish. A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will enhance the prospects of a breakout of the 50-day SMA.If that happens, the bulls will try to push the price to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will signal a possible change in trend. The gradually rising 20-day EMA and the RSI above the midpoint suggest a strong comeback from buyers.Contrary to this assumption, if bears pull the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears are in no mood to relent. The pair could then plummet to the strong support at $1,728.74.The bears are aggressively defending the psychological level at $2,200. The pair could now correct to the 20-EMA where the buyers may step in. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the pair above $2,200.A breakout and close above this overhead resistance will open the doors for a possible rally to $2,400. Contrary to this assumption, if bears pull the price below the 20-EMA, the decline could extend to the $2,000 support. A break below the 50-SMA could result in a decline to $1,728.74.Internet Computer (ICP) dipped below the $28.31 support on July 20 but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. This suggests that bulls are accumulating at lower levels.The bounce off $26.92 picked up momentum and the bulls pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($38.53) on July 24. This is the first indication that the bearish sentiment could be ending. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, which also suggests that the selling pressure could be easing.If bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA ($47.33), the ICP/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $59.42. A breakout and close above this resistance will complete a double bottom pattern, indicating the start of a new uptrend.The pattern target on the upside is $90.53. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $26.92.Both moving averages have turned up on the 4-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting that bulls are in control. The buyers are likely to defend the 20-EMA on the downside.If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the pair could rise to the psychological level at $50. This level may act as resistance but if bulls do not give up much ground, the up-move may continue and the pair may rise to $59.42. Conversely, a break below the 20-EMA could pull the price down to the 50-SMA.Aave rebounded off $212.54 on July 20 and rose above the horizontal resistance at $280 on July 23, which suggests strong buying at lower levels. The price is currently stuck inside a symmetrical triangle.The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover, indicating that bulls are attempting a comeback. If the price rebounds off the moving averages, it will suggest a change in sentiment from sell on rallies to buy on dips.A breakout and close above the downtrend line will complete the symmetrical triangle pattern. The AAVE/USDT pair could then rally to $347.53 and later to $400.On the contrary, if bears pull the price below the moving averages, the pair could again gradually slide to the support line of the triangle. A break below the triangle may turn the tables in favor of bears.The bulls are facing stiff resistance at the psychological level at $300 but if they do not allow the price to sustain below the 20-EMA, it will increase the possibility of a break above the downtrend line. If that happens, the pair may move up to $347.53 in the short term.Alternatively, if the price sustains below the 20-EMA, the pair could drop to $268 and then to the 50-SMA. A strong bounce off this level will indicate buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to push the price to the downtrend line. A break below the 50-SMA will signal that bears have overpowered the bulls.Related: Powered by the people: 3 altcoins whose tweet volume spiked before a strong rallyTerra protocol’s LUNA token has bounced back sharply from $5.58 and reached the overhead resistance zone at $7.96 to $8.72. The bears had halted the previous recovery attempt by the bulls in this zone on July 11.If bulls push the price above $8.72, the momentum could pick up. The gradually rising 20-day EMA ($7.03) and the RSI above 59 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. The LUNA/USDT pair could then rally to the downtrend line.This level may again act as a resistance but if bulls do not give up much ground, the pair could attempt to break above the downtrend line.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will indicate that buying dries up at higher levels. The pair could then drop to $5.58.Both moving averages on the 4-hour chart are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. If bulls can sustain the price above $7.96, the possibility of a retest of $8.72 increases.If bulls can drive the price above $8.72, the short-term uptrend may pick up momentum and the pair may rise to $10. This level may act as resistance but if bulls can flip $8.72 to support, the uptrend may continue.Contrary to this assumption, if bears pull the price below the 20-EMA, it will suggest weakness in the short term. The pair could then drop to the 50-SMA.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

77,"An anonymous source within Amazon has reportedly told London business newspaper City A.M. that the e-commerce giant is planning to start accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments by the end of 2021, possibly setting the stage for broader mainstream acceptance of crypto transactions. “This isn’t just going through the motions to set up cryptocurrency payment solutions at some point in the future — this is a full-on, well-discussed, integral part of the future mechanism of how Amazon will work,” the source told City A.M., according to a report published on Sunday.Related: Bringing the crypto payments ecosystem around the world: Ray YoussefThe source indicated that, while Bitcoin is the first step in Amazon’s crypto ambitions, executives at the company were keen to add other established cryptocurrencies in the future. The “directive is coming from the very top,” referring to Jeff Bezos, they said, adding: In addition to accepting Bitcoin payments, Amazon is said to be exploring the creation of its own cryptocurrency, possibly as early as 2022, they said. Speculation about Amazon’s entry into the cryptocurrency market has been raging for days after a new posting for “Digital Currency and Blockchain Product Lead” appeared on the company's job board last week. As per the job description, the new hire will help develop Amazon’s digital currency strategy and product roadmap. The position requires strong domain expertise in blockchain, distributed ledgers, central bank digital currencies and crypto more generally.Related: Countries representing over 90% of global GDP are exploring CBDCsThis isn’t the first crypto-focused job posting at Amazon.

78,"A four-day winning streak brought the Bitcoin (BTC) prices closer to testing its 50-day exponential moving average (~$35,115) as resistance.The wave, which was instrumental in strengthening Bitcoin's bullish bias across 2020 as support, flipped to become a resistance during the May 2021 sell-off. In doing so, it capped the cryptocurrency from extending its upside rebound moves many times.For instance, Bitcoin's drop from $56,900 to $30,000 in mid-May prompted bulls to buy the dip. As a result, the cryptocurrency shot back above $40,000 but found its bullish momentum exhausting right near the 50-day EMA. The scenario repeated multiple times after May's retracement attempt, as shown in the chart below.Rekt Capital, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, turned to a 2020 fractal to determine potential outcomes from the ongoing Bitcoin price action.The trader noted that Bitcoin price tested the 50-day EMA as resistance in October last year when the BTC/USD pair was trading shy of $10,000. But after breaking the wave to the upside, BTC/USD eventually established a record high near $65,000.""This [was] when BTC formed an almost identical fractal of Bitcoin's current price action,"" the profile noted, hinting that the fractal might repeat as Bitcoin tests the same resistance level after nine months.Bitcoin closed in to reclaim 50-day EMA after painting a rosy week.The benchmark cryptocurrency was off to end the seven-day session up by more than 8%. A majority of its gains came after The B-Word conference that features a trio of Wall Street biggies— Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey, and Ark Invest's founder Cathie Wood. The executives took turns to speak favorably about Bitcoin technology and shared their thoughts about the future.Musk, whose comments on cryptocurrencies are notorious for moving markets, revealed that his private rocket company SpaceX holds Bitcoin. He also added that Tesla would resume its Bitcoin payment option once its miners switch to more renewable energy sources to operate its blockchain.  Bitcoin also appeared to have capitalized on risk-on flows led by a choppy U.S. dollar index and a rising Wall Street. Next week appears busy with high-profile data and policy-statement releases.On Tuesday, the U.S. Conference Board will publish the Consumer Confidence Index for July. In addition, a preliminary Consumer Sentiment Index report from the University of Michigan shows a negative change in consumer sentiment. The report also professes fears of a sharp rise in inflation.As of late, inflationary pressures have boosted the dollar's appeal among investors. This has sapped Bitcoin's interim bullish outlook despite the cryptocurrency's popular safe-haven narrative. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its decision on interest rates and publish its monetary policy statement.Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in congressional testimony earlier this month that they are still away from tapering their $120B a month bond-buying program. He commented that a decision on scaling back the Fed's asset purchases would come only upon seeing a substantial improvement in the labor market.However, the U.S. central bank officials expect to discuss whether they could start tapering by the end of this year. In detail, a hawkish shift in the Fed policy in June was partially responsible for pushing Bitcoin prices lower and the dollar higher. Therefore, Bitcoin bulls would expect to remain cautious about the potential outcome of the FOMC meeting.Related: Bitcoin bull outlines 7 steps to more fiscal stimulus and higher BTC pricesOn the other hand, if the Fed decides to sleep on the tapering talk, given the rising economic uncertainties led by the fast-spreading Delta variant of the Covid-19, it could hamper the dollar's appeal and, in turn, provide a certain degree of upside boost to Bitcoin.Thinking about thinking?

79,"Though he has had 11 business failures, today Ray Youssef is building Bitcoin-funded schools across Africa as executive director of the Built With Bitcoin Foundation and is helping millions of people buy and sell cryptocurrency as CEO of Paxful. However, Youssef also admits to looting hardware stores on behalf of a convent school after Hurricane Katrina and says he was nearly shot as a suspected CIA agent during the Egyptian Revolution.He has just returned from El Salvador, where he spent time at Bitcoin Beach — where he says even children are using Bitcoin (BTC). Crypto payments services are important there because 70% of people in El Salvador have no bank account. For Youssef, peer-to-peer financial networks spell hope for the developing world.When Youssef first heard about Bitcoin in 2011, he quickly “dismissed it as nerd money.” He had more pressing things on his mind, as that year he left the relative comfort of New York to support the revolution in his native Egypt. There, he went to the core of the protests at Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo and “nearly died on the first night of really crazy fighting” during which he was arrested by the military as a suspected CIA agent. “I could write a book on that one night alone,” he concluded with a laugh that exuded mystery.He’s not the first crypto leader to throw themself into a revolution — like Griff Green, who once protected polling booths in Catalonia, or Amir Taaki, who went to fight with the Kurdish YPG. After he returned home to the United States, however, he began integrating his experiences of the revolution and questioning many things about society.The energy in Nigeria will transform the world. The youth have already begun building a pan African financial settlement layer using #bitcoin and nothing can stop peer to peer. Africa is now leading the new world of finance and crypto adoption. Let us all show them love https://t.co/kTSFDdYwUl pic.twitter.com/uufSnLKUZzOne of the rabbit holes he descended was that of money. “I started asking questions about money: Where is it? Where does it come from?” he said. Soon, he “began to see history through a very different lens.” That’s when he returned to Bitcoin, where he felt he could find answers.It seems that crypto attracts revolutionaries, perhaps backing the idea of a technological or financial revolution brought on by blockchain. As he arrived at Bitcoin Center NYC for his first meetup in 2013, he wondered about the other Bitcoiners: “What are they like? Are they on the same journey that I am on?”Describing the event, he sounded not unlike a pilgrim recounting a tale of a faraway shrine where they’d hoped to find other seekers of truth. The first person he met, Artur Schaback — his soon-to-be business partner — was the only other tall guy in the meeting, “So we got along, and we really bonded over the belief that Bitcoin could help the little guy.” Soon, they started working on a Bitcoin retail solution, but it was no easy ride.The two adventurers “ended up homeless, surfing couches.” Youssef felt he had hit rock bottom, and he needed to ask for help — he was terrified of his mother finding out about his situation. He fasted for a month, and he prayed. “I had to be truly humbled and really begged God for help — I was broken, defeated, and I got a very special night — it was the Night of Power of Ramadan,” he recalled solemnly. Whatever he experienced then, for Youssef, it represented a turning point.Youssef initially moved to the U.S. with his family from Egypt when he was 2, and by 8, he was already working odd jobs. He studied history at Baruch College in New York starting in 1996, but his real passion lay with computers. He got his first PC at 19 and “taught myself to code right away and started doing startups.” He worked as a senior software engineer at early smartphone company YadaYada first for two years before embarking on his entrepreneurial path. The first of these was related to coupons being distributed over text messages, but the idea failed to gain traction.The young entrepreneur soon went on to have his first taste of success, however, as he pivoted to downloadable ringtones. His new company, called MatrixM, “went from like $0 to $1 million revenue in less than six months.”Though he got off to a strong start, the next decade did not provide a comfortable ride. Youssef best describes this turbulent part of his life on LinkedIn, where he writes his title as “Entrepreneur” at “11 failed startups and many lessons learned.” The fact that he did not give up during that time speaks volumes. Though his initial success could be attributed to mere luck, it surely helped him to believe in himself despite years of failure. Whether he was a competent entrepreneur after his first success or not, he surely had put in the hard yards to become one after the 11th failure.In his work at MatrixM, Youssef discovered that peer-to-peer infrastructure, then still in its infancy, was the key to getting access to ringtones and a broad audience — users could upload ringtones as well as download them. Today, Youssef explained, peer-to-peer platforms like Uber and Airbnb have “become part of our daily lives.” The same will soon happen with peer-to-peer finance. “Humanity has been waiting for this one for a long time,” he said. While developed countries can benefit, Youssef said that the need in emerging economies, like throughout much of Africa, is much greater.He described the issues people face around transacting money as “mind-bending — even if they have a bank account and get a bank card, they can only spend $100 a month maximum with your Visa card.” This means that sending money in and out of Africa can quickly become a nightmare, as merchants cannot easily buy goods from China, for example. “They have to go through like three or four hops, turn their money into USD on the black market, and find a way to get that into a bank account that can actually wire the money because their personal accounts cannot,” he explained in an exasperated tone.Some time later in 2015, he was told of a method to profit by selling gift cards for BTC. Youssef was suspicious but decided to try it out of desperation. “I thought it was a scam, but it worked, so we scaled it up,” he recalled as if still surprised. With their system working, Youssef and Schaback decided to build a platform for trading cryptocurrency for gift cards, seeing it as “the best way to onboard the unbanked” into the world of cryptocurrency. After 72 hours of coding, Paxful was live.Youssef recalls a time when he took a customer service call from a “desperate lady” needing to purchase $2.50 worth of BTC in order to pay for an online classified ad. Down to her last $13 and without a bank account, she had no idea how to buy Bitcoin, as no services were geared toward people like her. With her children crying in the background, Youssef guided her to go to a nearby drugstore and buy a $10 Walmart gift card.The experience was formative, as it illustrated the real struggles of those without access to the traditional banking system who try to use modern internet-based services. “That’s why Paxful is on top — we are willing to do what others are not, we’re willing to go where others are not willing to go, like Nigeria,” Youssef explained, referring to the fact that small transactions carry little profit. He said that he feels a deep connection to Africa because of his roots. “This whole time, my dream was to help Africa,” he asserted.Today, Paxful allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrency via hundreds of methods. It is profitable and boasts over 6 million users, supported by “almost 500 people in nine offices around the world.” Soon, he believes, the platform will go mainstream, especially in Nigeria — which is the company’s biggest market and Youssef’s part-time home. “They’re the ones who are going to pull the rest of Africa forward. Nigeria is the Lion of Africa,” Youssef said with pride, as if he were a Nigerian himself. Soon, Youssef believes, it will be the Silicon Valley of Africa.The Built with Bitcoin Foundation, where Youssef serves as executive director, aims to build 100 schools around the world in support of local communities — an idea inspired by his experience after Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana in August 2005. Youssef saw the devastation on the news and decided that “I’m going down there myself.”On the ground, he found various charities to be of little help. “Finally, I managed to find these five Dominican nuns in the French Quarter. They had a school, and they wanted me to help rebuild and reopen the school.” Youssef went around the city to scavenge building materials and supplies, sometimes putting himself in great danger. At one point, he befriended a trucker, and “Me and him actually ended up looting a Lowes [hardware store] to get supplies to the school.”The opening of the school, Youssef believes, was key to helping the city reopen after the disaster, as the police and fire department “wouldn’t have come back if they couldn’t have put their children back to school.” Schools, he realized, are a pillar of community development and civilization. “That’s where I got the idea for Built with Bitcoin — a hundred schools in the next five years, and we’ve already built three of them,” he said. So far, the organization has completed three schools. In addition to schools, there is a focus on sustainable farming and the provision of wells in order to guarantee communities access to clean water.Help us on our mission to build 100 schools across the globe by donating.

Last week we opened our newest school in Kenya, where local children now have easier access to an education, paving the way for a brighter future.

Link to donate in bio. pic.twitter.com/qMbZPgZl1zAccording to the website, 92% of funds go directly into projects. One of the recent school projects in Rwanda was done in collaboration with a charity called Zam Zam Water. While the building of schools and wells certainly nourishes communities to grow, the idea that the proliferation of cryptocurrencies can help form more robust local and internationally connected economies is a much newer one. “I consider myself a Bitcoin optimist,” Youssef said.When El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, recently announced that Bitcoin was an official currency for the nation, the international press was skeptical. Youssef was among the CEOs who flew to the country in the weeks following the announcement, no doubt in hopes of opening up a new major market for Paxful.In his view, the new Bitcoin Law, which is seeing all citizens receive an airdrop of $30 in BTC, benefits the common people. Still, he noted that “The old aristocracy of El Salvador came out” to disparage him as a colonizer after he “took a photo-op at the airport with a bunch of police guards who are not working for me.”Youssef is confident that this is just the beginning, as grassroots use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will “spread to Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, Honduras as well, and eventually Mexico and all Central America — we’re seeing that very clearly.”"
80,"The ongoing story for the past couple of months in the cryptocurrency market has been confusion on whether Bitcoin (BTC) is destined for another leg down or is finally ready to break out toward new highs.Bitcoin's price history and data from previous corrections suggest that the current struggles for the top cryptocurrency could persist for a little bit longer due to the strengthening dollar, the possibility of decreasing economic stimulus and a slew of technical factors connected to Bitcoin's price action.According to data from Delphi Digital, one of the biggest factors placing strain on risk assets around the globe is the strengthening U.S. dollar which appears to be attempting a trend reversal after falling below 90 in late May.Rising dollar strength put a halt to the year-long uptrend in the 10-year US Treasury yield which is also a reflection that the economic expansions seen in the first half of 2021 are beginning to lose steam and there is a threat that a new wave of Covid-19 infections threatening the global economic recovery.The short-term outlook for Bitcoin remains bearish as previous instances of the “Death Cross,” which appeared on BTC's chart in late June, have been followed by a corrective period that can last for nearly a year.According to the analysts at Delphi Digital, the 12-month moving average is being tested as support, and a dip below this level would signal further downside for BTC price.The 12-month moving average has been a key support level for Bitcoin historically, so how the price performs near this level could dictate whether the current uptrend remains intact.Related: El Salvadorians take to the streets to protest Bitcoin lawOverall, caution is warranted for traders because low volumes have historically led to higher volatility when fewer open bids can lead to rapid price fluctuations.As explained by Kevin Kelly, a certified financial analyst at Delphi Digital, “the short-term outlook turns quite a bit more bearish if and when we break those key levels” near $30,000.Kelly said:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

81,"Traders tend to focus too much on timing the right entry to a trade, but very few focus on developing a strategy for exiting positions. If one sells too early, sizable gains are left on the table and if the position is held for too long, the markets quickly snatch back the profits. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and close a trade as soon as the trend starts to reverse.One classical setup that is considered reliable in spotting a trend reversal is the head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern. On the longer timeframes, the H&S pattern does not form often, but when it does, traders should take note and act accordingly.Let’s look at a few ways to identify the H&S pattern and when to act on it.The H&S pattern forms after a bull phase and indicates that a reversal may be around the corner. As the name indicates, the formation consists of a head, a left shoulder, a right shoulder, and a distinct neckline. When the pattern completes, the trend usually reverses direction.The above image shows the structure of an H&S pattern. Before the formation of the setup, the asset is in an uptrend. At the peak where the left shoulder forms, traders book profits and this results in a decline. This forms the first trough but it is not yet a strong enough signal to provoke a trend change.Lower levels again attract buying because the trend is still bullish and buyers manage to push the price above the left shoulder, but they are not able to sustain the uptrend.Profit-booking by the bulls and shorting by counter-trend traders pull the price down, which finds support near the previous trough. Joining these two troughs forms the neckline of the setup.As the price rebounds off the neckline, the bulls make one more attempt to resume the uptrend but as the price reaches the height close to the left shoulder, profit-booking sets in and the rally fizzles out.This lower peak forms the right shoulder and is usually in line with the left shoulder. The up-move reverses and the selling picks up momentum. Finally, the bears succeed in pulling the price below the neckline. This completes the bearish pattern and the trend reverses from bullish to bearish.Bitcoin (BTC) started a strong up-move after breaking out at $20,000 in December 2020. The BTC/USDT pair hit a local peak at $61,844 on March 13 and the price corrected, forming a trough on March 25. This local peak was the left shoulder.The bulls considered the dip as a buying opportunity because the trend was still up. Aggressive buying then pushed the price above $61,844 and the pair hit a new all-time high at $64,854 on April 14. This level attracted selling, which pulled the price down to form the second trough on April 25. The middle peak, higher than the other peaks, formed the head.Another attempt by the bulls to resume the uptrend failed on May 10. This formed the right shoulder and the ensuing correction broke below the neckline of the pattern. The breakdown and close below the neckline on May 15 completed this bearish setup.Sometimes, after the breakdown, the price retests the breakdown level from the neckline but when the momentum is strong the retest may not happen, an example which is shown in the chart above.To calculate the pattern target of this setup, determine the distance from the neckline to the top of the head. In this case, the value is $15,150. This distance is then subtracted from the breakdown point on the neckline to arrive at the minimum target objective.In the above example, the breakdown happened close to $48,000. This projected a pattern target at $32,850. This figure should be used as a guide because sometimes the decline exceeds the target, and in other scenarios the down move ends without reaching the target objective.Sometimes traders jump the gun and take counter-trend positions before the price breaks below the neckline of the developing H&S formation. Other times, the break below the neckline does not see follow-up selling and the price climbs back above the neckline. These instances may lead to failed setup, trapping the aggressive bears who are forced to cover their positions and this results in a short squeeze.Cardano (ADA) started an uptrend from the $0.10 level on Nov. 20, 2020. The uptrend hit resistance in the $0.35 to $0.40 zone in January and a H&S pattern started developing. The price dipped to the neckline on Jan. 27, but the bears could not sink and close the ADA/USDT pair below the support.When the price rebounded off the neckline on Jan. 28, it was a signal that the sentiment remained bullish. There was a minor hiccup on Jan. 30 and 31 when bears attempted to stall the up-move near the right shoulder but sustained buying from the bulls pushed the price above the head on Feb. 1. This break above the head of the pattern invalidated the setup.When a bearish setup fails, it catches several aggressive sellers on the wrong foot. This results in a short squeeze and propels the price higher. The same thing happened in the above example and the pair soared in February.The H&S pattern is considered a reliable reversal pattern but there are some important points to bear in mind.A downward sloping or flat neckline is considered to be a more reliable pattern compared to an upsloping neckline. Traders should wait for the price to break down and close below the neckline before initiating trades. Pre-empting the setup could result in losses because a failed bearish pattern could result in a strong rally.The pattern targets should only be used as a guide because sometimes the price may overshoot and continue the down move and at other times it may reverse direction before reaching the target objective.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

82,"Stone Ridge Asset Management, the alternative investment manager behind New York Digital Investment Group, has filed a new prospectus with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to add Bitcoin (BTC) to its open-end mutual fund. The prospectus for Stone Ridge Bitcoin Strategy Fund appeared on the SEC website on Friday, though the actual filing is dated July 26, 2021. The fund is part of an investment portfolio of Stone Ridge Trust, an open-end investment company registered in Delaware.According to the prospectus, the fund’s primary investment objective is “capital appreciation.” The fund seeks exposure to Bitcoin via futures markets as opposed to spot purchases, as explained below:The filing was made under SEC Form N-1A, which is required for establishing open-end management companies, including mutual funds. In terms of structure, the Fund is very similar to the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund II filed in May of this year.In the prospectus, the fund states that it “expects to have significant holdings of cash, U.S. government securities, mortgage-backed securities” and other assets.Regarding the fund's target exposure, the document states:Earlier this year, Stone Ridge filed a prospectus for its Diversified Alternatives Fund, which sought exposure to Bitcoin and other alternative assets.As Cointelegraph reported, Stone Ridge purchased 10,000 BTC in October 2020 through NYDIG as part of its post-pandemic investment strategy. The timeline of the purchase coincided with the beginning of a seven-month uptrend for Bitcoin that would see its value peak near $65,000 in April. Related: NYDIG set to bring Bitcoin adoption to 650 US banks and credit unionsDue to the growing appetite for digital assets, more institutional investors have gained exposure to Bitcoin over the past year, reflecting a broader acceptance by the mainstream. As Cointelegraph reported, the next wave of institutional adoption could be driven by financial advisers — a broad category of professionals who are always looking for new investment horizons. For financial advisers, investing in Bitcoin no longer carries the same stigma it did a few years ago. The Bitcoin price is in a clear uptrend this weekend, though analysts continue to warn of overhead resistance near $35,000. At the time of writing, BTC was up 6.5% to $34,230.Related: Bitcoin price hints at 'megaphone' bottom pattern, and a breakout toward $40K"
83,"Bitcoin (BTC) touched $34,000 on July 24 after the latest resistance flip held to propel the market higher.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD just hitting the $34,000 on Bitstamp on Saturday before returning to linger around $200 lower.The past 24 hours were profitable for traders as Bitcoin launched from $32,000 to deliver 4% gains that were holding above $33,800 at the time of writing. For Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe, it was necessary for the strength to continue and for $32,500 to hold in the event of a retracement.""Bitcoin breaks through that resistance at $32.5-$32.7K. Holding that for support = likely continuation towards $36K,"" he forecast in a Twitter update.Such behavior would not be at all surprising given the wide trading range in which BTC/USD is currently acting — $42,000, the point of all-time highs from February, remains the range ceiling and line in the sand for a definitive bull market continuation.Fellow trader and analyst Rekt Capital meanwhile highlighted ongoing changes with the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) as a sign of longer-timeframe bullishness returning.Last week, #BTC broke down from the triangular market structure that was formed by the 21-week EMA resistance & the 50-week EMA support

84,"Bitcoin's (BTC) latest rebound from below $30,000 has increased its prospects of extending its retracement move higher, at least according to one classic technical pattern.Dubbed as Broadening Formation, the megaphone-shaped pattern appears when the price moves inside two diverging trendlines. Investopedia states that a broadening formation represents disagreement over the next potential bias among investors. As a result, the price forms higher interim peaks and lower interim lows.Bitcoin appears to be trading inside a similar structure, as shown in the chart below. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency lacks volatility, one of the key features of the broadening formation pattern.Should the pattern play out, the Bitcoin price will undergo a bullish breakout above the structure's upper trendline.In doing so, it would expect to rise by as much as the maximum height between the broadening formation's upper and lower trendline. The upside setup appears because traders interpret broadening formation as a trend reversal pattern.ive been here before, and if your new to the megaphone bottom pattern then here you go ;-)

On an extended move higher, the potential to hit $40,000 is higher based on the cryptocurrency's recent price patterns.Conversely, a pullback from the dashed trendline tends to validate a Falling Channel pattern. On the other hand, Bitcoin could retrace its steps lower towards the so-called Broadening Wedge's support trendline (next downside target near $28,500).The conflicting Bitcoin setups emerge as bulls continue to defend $30,000 as support while bears enjoy control over the $34,000-$35,000 area. Unfortunately, that has landed BTC price inside a constrained trading range, giving no interim clues about where it wants to head next.Fundamentals have played a key role in trapping Bitcoin prices. To the upside, inflationary pressures from the traditional finance sector have provided tailwinds to Bitcoin's safe-haven narrative. Meanwhile, the downside is an increasingly global regulatory discontent toward the cryptocurrency sector.Related: SEC Chairman says cryptocurrency falls under security-based swaps rulesIn the last two months, the market has witnessed China banning cryptocurrency trading, India raiding regional crypto exchange WazirX, and the U.K. banning Binance's subsidiary from operating regulated businesses. In addition, Japan and Hong Kong also issued warnings and restrictions against Binance.Earlier this week, the U.S. state authorities closed crypto company BlockFi's accounts, alleging that the startup sold unregistered securities. The sector also received criticism for increasing carbon footprints via mining, which requires heavy computational power to run blockchains.""As long as global regulation of cryptocurrencies is not eased, or a resolution is met, I believe it is difficult to gain public trust, and for Bitcoin to scale the heights it reached in early 2021,"" Adam Todd, Founder, and CEO of Digitex, told Cointelegraph.JG Collins, head of the Stuyvesant Square Consultancy, also wrote in his Seeking Alpha op-ed that ""national economics regulators, state environmental regulators, and municipalities troubled by ""mining"" raising local electrical rates will sweep cryptos away like a tsunami.""The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

85,"In the past two decades, index and exchange-traded funds (ETF) have become some of the most popular forms of investing because they offer investors a passive way to gain exposure to a basket of stocks as opposed to investing in individual stocks which increases risk of loss. Since 2018, this trend has extended to the crypto sector and products like the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index (BITX) tracks the total return of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), Polygon (MATIC), Stellar (XLM) and Uniswap (UNI).The ability to access multiple top projects through one weighted average market cap index sounds like a great way to spread out risk and gain exposure to a wider range of assets, but do these products offer investors a better return in terms of profit and protection against volatility when compared to the top-ranking cryptocurrencies?Delphi Digital took a closer look at the performance of the Bitwise 10 and compared it to the performance of Bitcoin following the December 2018 market bottom. The results show that investing in BTC was a more profitable strategy even though BITX was slightly less volatile.According to the report, “indices aren’t meant to outperform individual assets, they’re meant to be lower-risk portfolios compared to holding an individual asset,” so it’s not surprising to see BTC outperform BITX on a purely cost basis.The index did offer less downside risk to investors as the market sold-off in May but the difference was “trivial” as “BTC’s max drawdown was 53% and Bitwise’s was 50%.”Overall, the benefits of investing in an index versus Bitcoin are not that great because the volatile nature of the crypto market and frequent large drawdowns often have a larger effect on altcoins.Delphi Digital said:Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been one of the hottest crypto sectors in 2021 led by decentralized exchanges like Uniswap (UNI) and SushiSwap (SUSHI) and lending platforms like AAVE and Compound (COMP).The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) aims to tap into this rapid growth and the DPI token has allocations to 14 of the top DeFi tokens, including UNI, SUSHI, AAVE, COMP, Maker (MKR), Synthetic (SNX) and Yearn.finance (YFI).When comparing the performance of DPI to Ether since the inception of the index, Ether significantly outperformed in terms of profitability and volatility, as evidenced by a 57% drawdown on Ether versus 65% for DPI.While this is an “imperfect comparison” according to Delphi Digital due to the fact that “the risk and volatility of DeFi tokens are higher than Ether’s,” it still highlights the point that the traditional benefits seen from indices are not mirrored by crypto-based baskets.Delphi Digital said:For the time being, Bitcoin and Ether have proven to be two of the lower-risk cryptocurrency plays available when compared to crypto index funds that offer exposure to a larger number of assets.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

86,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recovery is facing resistance near $32,500, suggesting that the ride higher may not be an easy one. However, a positive sign is that demand for cryptocurrencies remains strong and lower levels continue to attract buyers.A survey of 150 family office clients of Goldman Sachs shows that 15% have already invested in crypto-assets and 45% want to take the plunge. The family offices manage more than $6 trillion in assets, meaning, even a small percentage of inflow from this sector could eventually boost crypto prices.It is not only the wealthy who are investing in cryptocurrencies. A recent survey by Gallup shows that Bitcoin ownership among U.S. investors, with $10,000 or more invested in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, has increased from 2% in 2018 to 6% as of June 2021.JPMorgan Chase may soon allow its retail wealth clients to invest in cryptocurrencies. The bank’s advisers may not be allowed to recommend crypto to their clients but they can execute trades requested by them.All this shows that investor interest in the crypto sector continues to increase. Could this result in a sustained recovery? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the 20-day exponential moving average ($32,569). The bulls did not give up much ground on July 22, which is a positive sign.The relative strength index (RSI) has risen to just below the midpoint, indicating that the bearish momentum is weakening. If buyers push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($34,352).This level may attract selling from the bears but if bulls can overcome the resistance and push the price above it, the relief rally could rise to $36,670.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA or the 50-day SMA, the bears will again try to sink the pair to $28,000. If they succeed, the pair could witness panic selling, clearing the path for a possible drop to $20,000.Ether’s (ETH) bounce off the critical support at $1,728.74 rose above the 20-day EMA ($2,014) on July 22. This suggests that bears may be losing their grip. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, indicating that bulls are attempting to make a comeback.The buyers will now try to challenge the 50-day SMA ($2,184) from where the previous relief rally had turned down on July 7. If the price turns down from this resistance once again, the bears will try to pull the price down to $1,728.74. A break below this support could start the next leg of the downtrend.Conversely, if bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will signal a possible change in trend. The pair may pick up momentum on a break above $3,000.The bears are attempting to stall the relief rally in Binance Coin (BNB) near the downtrend line but a minor positive is that bulls have not given up much ground. The altcoin formed an inside day candlestick pattern on July 22, indicating indecision among bulls and bears.If bulls drive the price above the downtrend line and the 50-day SMA ($319), it will suggest a possible change in the short-term sentiment. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally to $380 and later to $433.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to pull the price down to $251.41. A break below this support will suggest that bears have absorbed the demand and the pair could then drop to the critical support at $211.70.Cardano’s (ADA) rebound off $1 is struggling to rise and sustain above $1.19. This indicates the bears have not given up and are attempting to stall the recovery at this level.If the price turns down from the current level, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $1. A bounce off this level may keep the pair range-bound between $1 and $1.19 for a few days.A breakout and close above the 20-day EMA ($1.23) will clear the path for a possible rally to the downtrend line.The pair will turn negative and start a new downtrend if bears sink and sustain the price below $1. The next support to watch on the downside is $0.80 and then $0.68.XRP’s rebound off the critical support at $0.50 has reached the 20-day EMA ($0.61). This may prove to be a difficult hurdle for the bulls to cross as the altcoin has not closed above the 20-day EMA since May 18.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $0.50. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because if it cracks, the decline may extend to $0.45 and $0.40.Contrary to this assumption, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.70) and then to $0.75. A breakout and close above this level will suggest the start of a move back toward the downtrend line of the descending channel.Dogecoin (DOGE) formed an inside day candlestick pattern on July 22, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. The sellers are aggressively defending the overhead resistance at $0.21 but the bulls are not giving up much ground.If the tight consolidation near the overhead resistance at $0.21 continues, it will indicate that bulls are not closing their positions as they anticipate a move higher. A breakout and close above $0.21 could open the doors for a move to the 50-day SMA ($0.25).Alternatively, if the bulls fail to clear the hurdle at $0.21, the DOGE/USDT pair could again drop to $0.15. If the support holds, the pair may extend its stay between $0.15 and $0.21 for a few more days.A breakdown and close below $0.15 will signal the resumption of the downtrend. The next support on the downside is $0.10.The bulls pushed Polkadot (DOT) above the breakdown level at $13 on July 22 but they are facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($13.78). If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative.The bears will then make one more attempt to sink the DOT/USDT pair below the psychological support at $10. If they succeed, the pair could resume its downtrend and drop to the next support at $7.80.Contrary to this assumption, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears are losing their grip. That could result in a move to the overhead resistance at $16.93. A breakout and close above this level could start a sustained relief rally to $20 and then to $26.50.Uniswap’s (UNI) rebound has risen to the 20-day EMA ($17.85) where the bears may mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this level, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative.The bears will then make one more attempt to sink the price to the strong support at $13. A breakdown and close below this support will complete the descending triangle pattern, starting the next leg of the downtrend.Conversely, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the UNI/USDT pair could reach the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will invalidate the bearish setup. That could start an up-move to $25 and then $30.Related: Axie Infinity refreshes record high as AXS ascends 131% in just 3 daysThe rebound in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has reached the 20-day EMA ($461), which has acted as a stiff resistance in the past few days. The bears will again try to stall the relief rally at this resistance.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USDT pair could again drop to the critical support at $370. A breakdown and close below this support will indicate the resumption of the downtrend.On the other hand, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to the stiff overhead resistance at $538.11. If the price turns down from this level, the pair could remain stuck between the large range of $370 to $538.11 for the next few days.Litecoin (LTC) rose above the $118 level on July 22, suggesting aggressive buying at lower levels. The bulls will now try to extend the relief rally and push the price back above the 20-day EMA ($126).If they manage to do that, it will signal that the downtrend could be losing momentum. The LTC/USDT pair may then rally to the 50-day SMA ($142) where the bears could again mount a stiff resistance. A break above this resistance may indicate the start of a stronger relief rally.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA once again, it will indicate that the sentiment remains negative. The bears will then make one more attempt to extend the down move. A break below $100 could open the doors for a fall to $70.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

87,"Crypto investors are betting big on real estate this year as the cryptocurrency market continues to grow. New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) recently conducted a survey that found that 46 million Americans own Bitcoin, equating to 22% of all adults. While optimistic, some cryptocurrency investors have expressed concerns regarding the security, custody and volatility of digital assets.For example, Nickel Digital Asset Management, a regulated European investment manager dedicated to the crypto market, surveyed institutional investors and wealth managers from the United States and Europe who collectively have $275 billion in assets under management. Findings show that 76% of these individuals are concerned about the security of their digital assets. The same percentage said this about the size of the market and liquidity, followed by 71% who see the regulatory environment for the crypto market as a major issue.This in mind, many crypto holders have started investing Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies into less risky assets such as real estate. Ben Shaoul, managing partner of Magnum Real Estate Group, told Cointelegraph that the company has recently been receiving more requests to sell real estate to cryptocurrency holders. According to Shaoul, Magnum began conducting crypto for real estate transactions about three years ago:Eric Hedvat, chief operating officer of Jet Real Estate and a special consultant for Magnum, further told Cointelegraph that given the fast-paced growth of today’s crypto market, BTC payments for real estate is more important than ever before since it offers crypto investors an opportunity to grow with cash flow: “The cryptocurrency market has created a vast network of new wealth that wants to find traditional assets to invest in like real estate. There also aren’t many commercial properties for sale to buy with Bitcoin.”Specifically speaking, Shaoul noted that the income generated from the retail condominium building that Magnum sold for $15.3 million in BTC during 2019 is all credit. “M&T bank has been a tenant in this building since it was built. They are a multi-billion-dollar bank.” This is an important detail, as Shaoul further commented that individuals who have created new wealth with cryptocurrency don’t have a way to monetize it or create a steady income stream:This has especially become the case due to interest rates in the United States. To put this in perspective, a recent survey conducted by the Financial Times and the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business found that elevated inflation may make the Federal Reserve raise U.S. interest rates at least twice by the end of 2023. “In an environment where interest rates are where they are now, you can’t monetize into cash and leave your money in the bank and convert,” Shaoul said, adding that as a result, Magnum has been seeing a lot of cash move out of both the crypto and equities markets into hard assets such as real estate.Piper Moretti, CEO and founder of The Crypto Realty Group, told Cointelegraph that crypto for real estate transactions is indeed becoming more common. Moretti shared that her firm currently has real estate listings available for Bitcoin in Tulum, Uruguay, Puerto Rico and Costa Rica.Although this is the case, Moretti mentioned that many buyers purchasing real estate with crypto are taking loans out against their cryptocurrency. “Because of capital gain issues and the belief that Bitcoin’s price will reach $100,000 by the end of this year, people are taking loans out against their crypto. This way, they can keep their crypto and still monetize,” she remarked.Joseph Kelly, CEO of Unchained Capital — a Bitcoin financial services company — confirmed this, noting that the firm has seen about 30%–40% of its loan originations go toward real estate.While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used to purchase real estate, it’s important to note that, oftentimes, sellers prefer cash to crypto when dealing with these transactions. Moretti explained, “If a seller receives multiple offers, 99% of the time they’re going to push the cash offers to the top of the pile, even if it’s a crypto conversion because more likely than not they will be receiving the cash at closing.”To put this into perspective, Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer of BitPay — a Bitcoin payments processor — told Cointelegraph that BitPay has facilitated $100 million in real estate transactions in the past five years. Singh mentioned that crypto transactions can easily be converted to U.S. dollars:Although this is typically the case, Shaoul shared that Magnum keeps a percentage of cryptocurrency obtained through real estate transactions in the company’s treasury. “We keep a portion of this to maintain the same percentage of crypto we’ve been balancing for the last six to seven months.” In order to do this, Shaoul shared that the firm is working with the crypto investment company Galaxy Digital to help manage cryptocurrency gained from real estate transactions.While it’s certainly notable that crypto holders have been seeing more opportunities to purchase real estate with digital assets, some industry experts believe that this recent trend has become overhyped.For instance, Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of Propy — a real estate transaction platform powered by blockchain technology — told Cointelegraph that many of the stories in the media today focus on crypto payments for real estate as if this is a new development. But to Karayaneva’s point, accepting crypto payments dates back to 2014, when BitPay helped facilitate the sale of a Lake Tahoe property that sold for $1.6 million in BTC. In 2014 , a tech entrepreneur also listed his Tiburon, California home for sale for $3.6 million, which was payable in Bitcoin.Karayaneva believes that blockchain technology being leveraged to facilitate crypto-to-crypto transactions will be the real game-changer for the real estate industry. It is possible to close a real estate transaction entirely in Bitcoin, without any cash conversion involved. Karayaneva explained that conducting transactions this way saves time for both the buyer and seller:Karayaneva further mentioned that many escrow companies today still don’t want to be involved with crypto transactions, which is why a smart-contract framework is a more attractive option.Moretti, however, begs to differ, noting that using a blockchain to conduct real estate transactions can be difficult since it doesn’t go through the normal escrow process. “I know this can be done, but it’s clunky. There are also good funds laws we adhere to in California, and it may be hard to get regulators on board with such a solution.”While it’s too soon to tell whether blockchain technology will be the missing link for real estate transactions, it’s clear that more crypto holders are using Bitcoin to purchase properties today. “People are looking to move unstable assets to a stable asset. And what’s more stable than real estate?” Singh remarked."
88,"Massena, a town in New York along the border with Canada, has placed a temporary suspension on new Bitcoin (BTC) mining operations in the area.According to a report by the Associated Press on Friday, Massena town officials mandated the 90-day moratorium on new Bitcoin mining activities due to aesthetic concerns.Steve O’Shaughnessy, a Massena town supervisor, said miners littered roads with trailers laden with computers and other hardware required to mine Bitcoin. The AP report quoted O’Shaughnessy’s statement to WWNY-TV, saying:Town officials will reportedly use the 90-day moratorium to ensure that roadsides in Massena are decluttered with trailers and shipping containers are moved off-road.Meanwhile, Massena Electric is reportedly looking to sign deals with three crypto firms. According to the AP report, the power company also has its own moratorium on working with new crypto miners.Related: Four North American Bitcoin miners that could benefit from the East-West shiftWith small border towns in North America hemorrhaging factory jobs over the past decade, Bitcoin and crypto mining operations represent a return of some industrial activities to places like Massena.Cheap electricity in these areas is often a major draw for Bitcoin miners, and in return, these companies offer the promise of jobs and bootstrapping the local economy.Indeed, with China’s massive crypto-mining crackdown and the expected East-to-West hash rate migration, these smaller towns in North America might play host to more Bitcoin mining activity.Meanwhile, the major North American Bitcoin mining operations continue to upscale their capacity amid the current hash rate drop in a bid to capture a larger portion of the market.North American Bitcoin miners controlling a larger share of the global hash rate distribution may also contribute to putting the industry in better standing with regulators, especially in the area of environmental conservation."
89,"After an astronomical bull run into the beginning of this year that was followed by an abrupt halt and 50% drop since April, crypto markets are at a fork in the road right now. Where they go next could inform us about how market conditions impact mainstream adoption via artists, creators and celebrities who have been taking a greater interest in the space.To date, the market for nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and social tokens has been anecdotally correlated to the broader crypto market. As creators bring in more fans from outside of crypto, we’re seeing that correlation diminish, albeit with a small sample size. If Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) don’t break out of their respective slumps and we do enter a bear market, there is a strong case to be made that the growth of the creator economy will insulate social tokens from the effects of the rest of the market.Related: On the fence: If this is a crypto bear market, how long can it last?The reality is that most creators’ audiences don’t care about the price of BTC or ETH — at least not yet. They are buying tokens to unlock exclusive token-gated benefits and to interact with their favorite artists and creators in new digital and physical ways.As always, whether the next few months are bullish or bearish, both scenarios present unique opportunities for our industry. Whether the market pulls in new participants in good market conditions or shakes out the “weak hands” in a bear market, the near future presents a very pivotal time for the intersection of the creator and crypto economies.Since the crypto bull market and NFT boom took off earlier this year, creators and celebrities have taken up a great deal of space alongside Bitcoin in the mainstream conversation about crypto. Today, the NFT market has cooled significantly, and fewer big-name celebrities are cranking out NFTs like we saw in March. Does this mean that NFTs were a passing trend, or will crypto change the way that celebrities and their fans interact in the long run?There’s little doubt that a few celebrities have used crypto for easy endorsement money or to make a quick buck. But many of them are truly exploring how crypto can bring them closer to fans and using the technology to express themselves in new ways.Related: Hype is over: How NFTs and art will benefit from each other moving forwardAt the end of the day, influencers who used crypto as a “cash grab” will disappear from the space during down cycles, as have many generations of crypto tourists. We’re still talking to a lot of genuinely engaged creators about how they can incorporate NFTs into a larger-scale crypto activation with their fans. Whether they’re household-name celebrities or creators with an engaged, albeit more niche, audience, the foundation for creators and crypto has been firmly established to withstand any market conditions.It isn’t just household-name creators who are using crypto to forge deeper connections with fans and own their financial relationships instead of allowing Big Tech platforms to dictate the terms – creators with smaller and mid-sized followings have also explored ways to connect with their audiences via crypto and NFTs.The creator economy is made up of more than 50 million YouTubers, TikTok stars, bloggers and other types of content creators. The sector is growing at a breakneck pace: Ad spend on influencer marketing alone approached $10 billion last year, not to mention creators transacting directly with their fans. Within these direct creator-fan transactions, crypto is becoming more and more common.Despite the fact that the NFT market has retraced, creators are continuing to explore the space and the tech is continuing to build toward more functionality and utility. Within crypto, creators with million-dollar “market cap” economies are more common than ever. And it isn’t just creators from the cryptosphere who are successfully building crypto economies.For example, Twitch streamer Alliestrasza primarily streams card games like Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering Arena to her 225,000 subscribers. Alliestrasza has built a million-dollar economy with her community of ALLIE social token holders by engaging the token community with unique benefits like participating in fan tournaments for various games.As more creators build these kinds of economies with independent value and functions, we’ll see less and less correlation between social tokens that are designed around active community uses/engagement and the broader, more volatile crypto market that can attract more speculative participants.A lot of people who were early to crypto might question why all of this matters. Creator coins aren’t a peer-to-peer electronic cash system or a “global computer.” True, maybe they are not. But bringing new audiences into crypto and helping them understand the value of the technology is the only way to grow the space in a significant way. Crypto is still early on its adoption curve. In order to get the technology into more hands, people will either need to use the technology as it is today (which is occurring at a fairly modest pace) or the technology will have to build more user-friendly layers that are interesting to people with less interest in or knowledge of technology and finance.Related: Understanding the systemic shift from digitization to tokenization of financial servicesMeeting consumers where they are — interacting with their favorite celebrities and creators — is one of the most obvious ways to do that. But the opportunity goes beyond creators and celebrities: Imagine what the adoption curve would look like if every person, brand or website on the internet that could benefit from decentralization was tokenized.Of course, evolving regulations will play a role in the pace at which crypto and crypto-related projects are developed and adopted. This will be a key area to watch for creators and celebrities around the world, especially in the United States. And for the crypto platforms that serve creators, Financial Action Task Force compliance is already a must.Related: FATF draft guidance targets DeFi with complianceBut as the technology and regulation coalesce and crypto is adopted into the experiences that internet users are already having, billions of people will gain exposure and become more familiar with the power and potential of the technology.This could be the rising tide we’ve all been waiting for.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

90,"Bitcoin (BTC) has a better probability of recovering back to $60,000 than breaking below its current support level of $30,000 to target $20,000, believes Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.A screenshot from McGlone's latest analysis on the flagship cryptocurrency, first shared by Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, shows him comparing Bitcoin's ongoing price action with the ""too-cold"" period of the 2018–2019 trading session.In detail, the BTC/USD exchange rate entered a prolonged consolidation period near $4,000 following an 80%-plus crash in 2018, but a sudden run-up in 2019 sent its prices to as high as $14,000 on some exchanges.McGlone, who's known for his previous bullish calls on Bitcoin, noted that BTC, which has been consolidating near $30,000 since May, could post a similarly surprising rally while aiming to hit a refreshed resistance target near $60,000.""The more tactical-trading-oriented bears seem to proliferate when Bitcoin sustains at about 30% threshold below its 20-week moving average, allowing the buy-and-hold types time to accumulate,"" the strategist wrote.Bitcoin's bearish and bullish cycles appear to wobble around three key moving average indicators: the 20-week exponential moving average (20-week EMA; the green wave), which serves as interim support/resistance, the 50-week simple moving average (50-week SMA; the blue wave), and the 200-week simple moving average (20-week SMA; the orange wave).During bull trends, Bitcoin prices typically stay above the three moving averages. Meanwhile, bear trends see the cryptocurrency's prices closing below the 20-week EMA and the 50-week SMA, as shown in the chart above.The 200-week SMA typically serves as the last line of defense in a bear market. So far, Bitcoin has bottomed out twice near the orange wave, each time sending the prices explosively higher. For instance, a take-off from the 200-week SMA in 2018 drove Bitcoin prices to almost $14,000.Similarly, the wave support capped the cryptocurrency's downside attempts during the COVID-19-led crash in March 2020. Later, the price bounced from as low as $3,858 to over $65,000.Bitcoin is now in its third drop below this trendline since 2018. The cryptocurrency has broken below the 20-week SMA (near $39,000) and is now targeting the 50-week SMA (circa $32,200) as support. If the old fractal is repeated, it should continue falling toward the 200-week SMA (around $14,000).However, McGlone believes there could be an early rebound. As a bullish fundamental, the strategist pointed toward the recent China crypto ban.Beijing announced a complete ban on cryptocurrency operations in May. The decision stonewalled the mining operations in the country, which were forced to either cease or move their base outside. Bitcoin prices fell sharply in response.Nevertheless, McGlone highlighted China's rejection of open-source software crypto assets as a plateau in their economic ascent. In a tweet published Friday, the analyst attached an index showcasing booming volumes and capitalization of U.S. dollar-backed digital assets, including Tether (USDT). He then pitted the rising demand for digitized dollars against the Chinese yuan-to-dollar exchange rates, noting that the logarithmic scale of market capitalization fluctuations between the two fiat currencies was below the baseline zero between 2018 and 2020. That means the yuan was depreciating against the dollar.The scale just went back above zero, signaling interim growth for the yuan against the dollar. But its uptrend still appeared dwarfed by Tether, whose market cap rose by more than 40% above the baseline. McGlone noted:Additionally, Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO of global payment network Mercuryo, noted that while the United States government has not officially launched a central bank-backed digital dollar as China has, the availability of many other alternatives — including Tether, USD Coin (USDC) and Binance USD (BUSD) — could pose a challenge to the Chinese-controlled digital yuan.""These cryptocurrencies are pegged 1:1 against the U.S. dollar and as shown in the chart McGlone shared, the dollar is leading the digital rise over the Chinese Yuan,"" Kozyakov said.However, rejecting McGlone's take, Yuriy Mazur of CEX.IO Broker noted that the Chinese economy should continue flourishing with or without cryptocurrencies, saying that it has nothing to do with the demand for digital assets.Related: US–China trade war and its effect on cryptocurrencies""The Chinese government is too smart to miss out on something the world deems valuable,"" Mazur told Cointelegraph.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

91,"Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce has voiced concerns over the United States lagging behind global jurisdictions in adopting cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs).During an online appearance at the Bitcoin (BTC) conference “The B Word,” Peirce pointed out that many other countries such as Canada have already been trading crypto ETFs, while the U.S. is still deciding whether to approve such a trading instrument. She stated:The SEC commissioner also mentioned her concern that U.S. regulators could be overstepping their remit by forcing the local crypto industry to play by a separate set of rules than everyone else.“We’re not a merit regulator, so we shouldn’t be in the business of deciding whether something is good or bad, an investor is thinking of their entire portfolio, and sometimes we’re thinking in one-off terms of a particular product standing on its own, and we forget that people are building portfolios,” she noted.Peirce’s latest remarks come in line with her recent criticism of U.S. crypto regulation, with the SEC commissioner last month once again urging authorities to refrain from overregulating the crypto industry. Despite calling for a softened regulatory stance on crypto, the commissioner still believes that clear crypto rules are critical for the industry to thrive without fear of breaking the law. A long-running crypto advocate, Peirce is widely referred to as “Crypto Mom” within the crypto community.Related: Fund management firm Global X files with the SEC for a Bitcoin ETFAs previously reported, U.S. regulators have delayed multiple approvals of crypto ETFs recently after consistently postponing such decisions over the past several years. In the meantime, some countries have already approved or launched Bitcoin ETF trading, with 3iQ and CoinShares’ Bitcoin ETF going live on the Toronto Stock Exchange in April. Canadian fund managers Purpose Investments and Evolve Funds Group previously launched Bitcoin ETF trading as well."
92,"BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, so when its CEO, Larry Fink, remarked recently that he was seeing “very little in terms of investor demand” with regard to crypto and Bitcoin (BTC) based on “my last two weeks of business travel,” it set off some alarm bells.A lively Twitter discussion followed one commentator’s remarks of how BlackRock was simply protecting its legacy bond business, given that “Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, State Street, Morgan Stanley, all entered the space in response to demand.” Furthermore, BlackRock is the second-largest owner of MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock, regarded by many as a pure Bitcoin play.As has been recounted, Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $64,000 on April 14 but soon thereafter plunged, and it has now been trading at roughly half its April high for weeks, as have many other cryptocurrencies. Some users are understandably nervous.Perhaps it is better to adopt a longer-term view regarding recent events. “Two months is a very short time period in crypto,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan explained to Cointelegraph, adding, “I’m not sure what to make of Fink’s comments, except that they don’t align with our day-to-day experience.”“Institutional investors take 12–36 months to do due diligence,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of digital asset management firm Arca, told Cointelegraph, adding further, “They aren’t timing market cycles. They are trying to get comfortable with the asset class to make a 10-year-plus commitment.”“It’s important to remember that the market is up more than 200% in the past 12 months, making it the best-performing asset class in the world over the last year,” added Hougan, who claims to see continuous inflows into Bitwise.Moreover, crypto and blockchain technology is a global phenomenon, and one has to be careful about drawing worldwide conclusions from American or European events. BlackRock, for the record, is based in New York City. “It doesn’t feel like a crypto winter here in Asia,” Justin d’Anethan, head of exchange sales at Singapore-based EQONEX, told Cointelegraph, adding:Elsewhere, Emin Gün Sirer, Cornell University professor and creator of the Avalanche blockchain protocol, told Cointelegraph China recently that hedge funds aren’t the only institutional players probing the crypto waters these days: “I have been getting contacts from retirement funds, [...] far more slower-moving but with maybe 10 times more dollars under their control, and they are slowly coming into crypto.”Also, Fidelity Digital, an institutional pioneer in the crypto space, has been aggressively expanding lately — boosting staff by 70% due to “strong crypto demand,” including 100 new workers in Dublin, Boston and Utah, as Fidelity Digital president Tom Jessop told Bloomberg. The firm sees more demand from retirement advisors as well as companies, and it is broadening its product offerings accordingly. “We’ve seen more interest in Ether, so we want to be ahead of that demand,” said Jessop. Megan Griffin, a Fidelity Digital spokesperson, told Cointelegraph:Dorman was even more emphatic. “The interest in digital assets from new investors has accelerated — not slowed down,” he said. “Any slow down with allocations is more a function of summer than it is price.”Still, there are valid reasons why the demand for crypto could be seen as faltering. “There is little doubt that the boom and bust dynamics of the past weeks represent a setback to the institutional adoption of crypto markets and in particular of Bitcoin and Ethereum,” a JPMorgan strategist said in a report in June.“Of course, the crypto markets have indeed been going sideways,” Lex Sokolin, head economist at ConsenSys, told Cointelegraph, adding, “The drivers are some combination of pushback to mining, global macro risk-off trends and momentum slowing on sentiment/meme trading.” But the underlying fundamentals are solid, Sokolin continued:The events that have unfolded since the start of the summer have caused some investors to slow down and conduct a bit more research, acknowledged Hougan. China’s banning Bitcoin mining at around the same time that United States authorities seemed to be ramping up efforts to regulate crypto forced investors “to pause and reflect. The good news is that both of these developments are long-term positives for the market even if they introduce short-term volatility.”Still, the roller coaster ride of recent months is a reminder that BTC and crypto, generally, have still not solved their volatility problem. “Volatility scares everyone,” observed Dorman, adding, “Volatility is more accepted when you trust the value of the underlying asset — that’s the biggest hurdle with institutional investors in terms of their education.”Related: On the fence: If this is a crypto bear market, how long can it last?The only notable shift Dorman has seen in recent months “is that new investors are way more interested in DeFi, gaming and other cash-flow producing assets than they are in Bitcoin or Ethereum — or ETH competitors.”“Decentralized finance continues to mature and process transactions and loans,” said Sokolin, adding: “NFT-based platforms are seeing major studios and creators shift to new tokenized business models. Computational chains like Ethereum are clearly having a moment. It is also possible that we will see more DeFi-type activity anchored to Bitcoin, Solana or other chains, and that will grow the entire pie.”Crypto continues to face challenges, though. “We expect to see significant new activity on the U.S. regulatory front, for instance, and if regulators over-reach, that could have a material negative impact on crypto,” Hougan explained, while going on to add, “Of course, the flip side is true, too: If regulators put forth balanced regulation, that would lay the groundwork for the next great crypto bull market.”D’Anethan believes that many of crypto’s technological challenges, such as scalability and transaction speed, have “already been looked at and somewhat resolved,” but there is still a need to find the right balance between “network effect” and efficiency, noting:Overall, long-term trends remain positive, suggested Dorman, “We are in a multi-decade secular uptrend. [...] Every single near-term challenge is a long-term positive — regulation, China dispersion, etc.,” while Sokolin, for his part, called attention to a “deep investment in the digital asset long game by sophisticated participants that is happening now.”"
93,"Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, will be one of the key trends for the future of Twitter, CEO Jack Dorsey declared.The Twitter CEO said that Bitcoin would be a “big part” of the company’s future at the second-quarter earnings call, outlining the digital currency’s potential to further transform Twitter products and services.Referring to Bitcoin as a native currency of the internet, Dorsey described opportunities to integrate BTC into existing Twitter services including commerce, subscriptions and new features such as Twitter Tip Jar and Super Follows.The CEO explained to investors that a lot of Bitcoin-enabled innovation is “above just currency to be had,” as Twitter is committed to decentralize social media and provide more economic incentives. He noted that Bitcoin is one of three key trends for Twitter’s future alongside artificial intelligence and decentralization. “I think it’s hugely important to Twitter and to Twitter shareholders that we continue to look at the space and invest aggressively in it,” he said.Dorsey emphasized that Twitter is not alone in its commitment to crypto, citing aggressive digital currency development by social media giant Facebook, which expects to pilot its Diem cryptocurrency later this year. But unlike Facebook, Twitter will one day focus on BTC as a native internet open standard. Dorsey stated:Related: No, Jack Dorsey isn't trolling ETH by making its logo the Ethiopian flagDorsey’s latest Bitcoin call is reportedly the first time when the CEO has spoken publicly about how Twitter could integrate BTC into its products. The new remarks came shortly after Dorsey had discussed Bitcoin at the virtual BTC event “The ₿ Word” alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood. Dorsey said that many existing business models would be much different if Bitcoin existed before Twitter or Facebook. “We would certainly not have the dependency that we have on the advertising business model,” he noted.Dorsey is known as a major early Bitcoin believer, repeatedly arguing that Bitcoin is poised to be the single currency of the internet since at least 2018. His crypto-friendly digital payments firm Square is a solid Bitcoin investor, purchasing $50 million in BTC in late 2020 and then buying an extra $170 million in BTC in February 2021."
94,"Bitcoin (BTC) has become considerably more decentralized in the past year, one metric suggests — and the trend is growing.According to data from on-chain data resource Blockchain.com, hash rate distribution is increasingly favoring small, unknown miners. Despite the past 12 months seeing a large price run-up, Bitcoin miners have not become more “corporate” — mining is actually seeing more anonymous as small-scale entities join in.Looking at hash rate distribution, the trend is in evidence ever since the March 2020 crash, and this year has gathered pace.The drawdown from $64,500 all-time highs precipitated the move toward smaller players, which is something that would be expected from a falling hash rate incentivizing them to mine.As Cointelegraph reported, meanwhile, the hash rate has stabilized over the past two weeks and begun reclaiming lost ground.Analysis of revenues collected by the mining community as a whole underscores the recovery taking place, giving hope for the upward trend, which characterized the hash rate until May to resume.At the time of writing, the hash rate totaled an estimated 95 exahashes per second (EH/s), up from the floor of 83 EH/s.Future changes among miners nonetheless appear to focus on larger players, which, in the wake of the Chinese rout, are gathering force in the United States and elsewhere.Related: A green revolution in crypto mining? Industry answers wake-up callA slew of announcements this month, including one mining firm planning to go public in the U.S., combines with news that the industry’s environmental credentials are changing rapidly.“We’re also seeing a lot more disclosure from miners — 32% of hash rate joined a council, Bitcoin Mining Council, and they’ve produce quarterly disclosures now, and within that sample, the miners were 67% renewable or nuclear powered,” Nic Carter, co-founder of CoinShares, told CNBC Wednesday.Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, hinted that Tesla may begin accepting Bitcoin for payments again in the coming months based on these environmental changes."
95,"A recent survey has revealed Bitcoin has gained traction with younger U.S. investors in terms of awareness, interest, and ownership over the past three years.The study conducted by global analytics and advice firm Gallup revealed that the number of investors in the U.S. holding BTC has jumped from 2% in 2018, to 6% as of June 2021. The research defines “investors” as adults with $10,000 or more invested in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.It also reported that Bitcoin ownership among investors surveyed aged under 50 has more than trebled over the past three years to 13% from 3% in 2018. Unsurprisingly, it revealed ownership was much lower at just 3% for the over 50s group of investors, though this has also increased three-fold from 1% in 2018.The researchers noted that Bitcoin’s relatively modest ownership can be contrasted with more mainstream investments. The survey revealed that 84% of the investors polled reported having invested in stock index funds or mutual funds, while 67% said they owned individual stocks, and 50% have bonds.The results of the poll come from the Gallup Investor Optimism Index survey conducted between June 22 and 29, 2021, among 1,037 investors in America aged 18 and older. The sample for the study was weighted to be demographically representative of the U.S. adult population with a maximum margin of sampling error of ±5%.Related: Survey of millionaires finds 73% own or want to invest in cryptoOther findings reveal that the risk perception associated with Bitcoin has declined over the three-year period. Nearly all investors surveyed perceived BTC to be a risky investment, however, the percentage calling it “very risky” has declined from 75% to 60%. Most of the remaining 35% now consider it to be “somewhat risky,” while just 5% think it carries no risks.Gallup concluded that large investments in Bitcoin by well-known companies such as Tesla, Square, and Morgan Stanley may be giving it more mainstream credibility.A similar survey that polled institutional investors in May and June revealed that more than 80% of hedge fund executives and wealth managers surveyed that are already holding crypto assets intend to increase their holdings."
96,"Ethereum (ETH) is currently the leader when it comes to smart contract capabilities and the sheer number of projects operating on its network, but the push to build products on Bitcoin (BTC) is gaining traction with advocates like Square CEO Jack Dorsey spearheading the effort to bring decentralized finance (DeFi) to the Bitcoin network. One project aiming to combine the features of DeFi with the security of the Bitcoin network is Stacks (STX), a layer-one blockchain protocol designed to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to the Bitcoin network.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that since dropping to a low of $0.50 on June 22, STX price rallied 195% to $1.47 on July 11 and now that Bitcoin has shown some bullish momentum, STX price is moving higher again with a 10% gain on  July 22. Three reasons for the recent strength in STX include the release of the Clarity programming language which brought smart contracts to Stacks 2.0 and Bitcoin, the ability for STX holders to stake tokens for BTC rewards and the arrival of DeFi and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to the Bitcoin network.The introduction of the Clarity programming language on Stacks has been the main catalyst of growth for the Stacks ecosystem because it enabled the creation of smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.I hear this smart contracts for Bitcoin thing might be, maybe, sort of a big deal.@StacksClarity claims to be  a “decidable language” which means that “you can know, with certainty, from the code itself what the program will do.”The main difference between Clarity and other smart contract languages is its decidable language, which is not Turning complete, and the fact that the language is interpreted and broadcast on the blockchain as is, rather than being compiled, which “ensures that the executed code is human-readable and auditable.”The collaboration between the two networks means popular sectors like DeFi and NFTs now have a way to operate and be recorded on the Bitcoin network without needing to worry about slow transaction times and increased costs.Stacks recently rolled out STX staking for holders and this enables them to earn BTC as a reward.The Stacks network uses a novel mining protocol called proof-of-transfer (PoX), which runs in parallel to Bitcoin and uses the BTC network as a reliable broadcast medium for its block headers.While most proof-of-stake networks offer staking rewards paid out in the native token, members of the Stacks community can stake their STX tokens to earn BTC at an average rate of 10%.This represents one of the few opportunities across the crypto space where a token holder can stake their tokens and earn BTC as a reward.Related: Crypto staking rewards and their unfair taxation in the USOn July 10 STX created and sold the first-ever Bitcoin NFT from the Stacks blockchain.Historic moment for #Bitcoin

Cara Delevingne’s “Mine”, the first ever Bitcoin #NFT to be minted and auctioned on the #Stacks blockchain has sold for 18000 STX. $21000 at current prices

Cost to mint and transfer “Mine” was just 0.0007 #STX or $0.001https://t.co/hjJRZwGPgR The event was meant to mark the beginning of a new era of smart contracts on Bitcoin and additional bullish news revealed that USD Coin (USDC) will expand to the Stacks network. This prompted some pundits to cite the Bitcoin Law which states that “successful experiments in crypto will eventually come to Bitcoin.”The arrival of NFT and DeFi capabilities have also introduced new ways to leverage these popular sectors to earn a yield in BTC and this has the potential to attract new participants.As a result of these developments, momentum for STX has been on the rise in July as evidenced by an increase in price and 24-hour trading volume.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for STX on July 19, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen on the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for STX climbed into the green on July 19 and reached a high of 70 roughly 34 hours before the price rallied 42% over the next two days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

97,"Traders are showing a renewed sense of hope after Bitcoin’s (BTC) price held onto the $32,000 range for what could be the second day in a row. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that bulls have managed to regroup at the $32,000 level, where Bitcoin has hovered throughout the day, but traders are patiently waiting for further confirmation that Bitcoin may be in the midst of a trend reversal before fully reentering the market.Here’s what analysts and investors expect next from Bitcoin’s price.According to a recent report from Delphi Digital, an aggressive reversal was observed in the CME futures basis on Wednesday and that this is a bullish sign for BTC traders who scooped up “cheap” futures contracts. The resulting contango is interpreted as bullish because the futures price is above the spot price of the asset.As seen in the chart above, the open interest for CME’s Bitcoin futures doubled from $1.25 billion on Monday to $2.5 billion on Tuesday after institutions positioned themselves “slightly net long after an extended period of being short.”While leveraged funds remain net short as they utilize CME futures to hedge their spot exposure, Delphi Digital indicated that they have probably “closed out some amount of their positions.”Delphi Digital said:Bitcoin’s recovery above $32,000 reignited bullish optimism for many traders, but the road ahead is by no means a walk in the park due to the multiple zones of resistance that lie overhead.According to pseudonymous crypto Twitter analyst Rekt Capital, many of the previous support levels for Bitcoin, including $35,000 and $37,000, could soon act as resistance.Overall, #BTC has a cluster of potentially new resistances ahead

Another sign of bullishness came from pseudonymous Twitter user IzzyEibani, who highlighted the recent spike in exchange inflows as a possible sign that the bottom is in.A little bull hopium for you, inspired by a post from @MrBenLilly

Exchange inflows spiked 3 times since 2017, and each spike corresponded with a major bottom in price.

Each time, the market bottomed within a short time period following the inflows.If the market unfolds in a similar fashion to the historical pattern, there is a strong possibility that the recent drop to $29,500 may have been the bottom.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

98,"The South Korean government announced today that crypto exchanges will face punishment if they have not voluntarily registered with the country’s authorities by September 24.This new set of regulations will reportedly affect both exchanges based in South Korea and foreign exchanges that operate in Korean markets. According to the release, that includes any exchange where the Korean language is supported, marketing is geared toward Koreans, or payments can be made using the Korean won.Under the Specific Financial Information Act, the punishment for exchanges that continue to operate without registration is up to five years in prison or a fine of up 50 million Won — roughly $43,500 USD. Sources suggest that there are plans to block websites belonging to unregistered exchanges in the future as well.Related: Bank of Korea selects Kakao’s blockchain arm for digital won testsKorean users should check on September 25 to see if the exchange they are using is registered to avoid any related penalties. As of that date, sales made through such exchanges would be illegal within the country.This announcement is the latest in a string of regulations concerning cryptocurrency around the globe. Earlier this week, the European Union announced plans to crack down on the sending and receiving of cryptocurrency in the hope of limiting money laundering. The SEC Chairman said cryptocurrency falls under the rules and regulations of security based swaps in the US and noted that more regulation could be coming. A meeting from the President Working Group on Financial Markets and other US agencies also took place this week concerning the use and risks of stablecoins. Regulatory recommendations are expected to be delivered in the coming months."
99,"This Friday’s weekly Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry currently holds $330 million in open interest. Considering the recent struggle to regain the $32,000 support level, this event is an important test of bulls’ willingness to display reversion signs.On Wednesday, Alameda Research announced that it had made Bitcoin purchases below $30,000, and Sam Trabucco, the firm’s quantitative trader, mentioned that the narrative for BTC could turn bullish because of the ongoing fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) caused by the China BTC mining ban, Grayscale GBTC unlock and recovery in stock markets.The chart above shows that the current downtrend channel, initiated three weeks ago, might be invalidated if the price breaks the $32,200 resistance. The move seems to have been sparked by Elon Musk’s statement that his firm SpaceX also holds Bitcoin.During the Wednesday meet-up with Cathie Wood and Jack Dorsey, Musk said that despite the rumors, he completely opposes recent speculations that Tesla has been selling some of its Bitcoin position.Elon Musk clarifies Tesla hasn't sold bitcoin after sparking sell-off https://t.co/jPxK5jBm3m pic.twitter.com/4uA5xB8OwBIt is worth noting that the rumors had some backing only because Musk gave conflicting signals on social networks. Moreover, Tesla had sold 10% of its Bitcoin holdings in the previous month.Friday’s options expiry might be the first strength test of this recent bounce. If bulls want to set $32,000 as a support level, there’s no better way than causing the most damage possible to the neutral-to-bearish put (sell) options.The first signal that bears have been trying to dominate is the put-to-call ratio. The 0.81 reading reflects a smaller amount of neutral-to-bullish call (buy) options for Friday, July 23’s, expiry.However, bears might have set themselves a trap because 96% of the put options used $32,000 or lower strike prices. If Bitcoin manages to stay above that level at 8:00 am UTC on Friday, only $8 million in put options will take part in the expiry.Related: Bitcoin price hits $32K but derivatives metrics still show signs of weaknessOn the other hand, there is $29 million worth of call options up to the $32,000 strike price. This $21-million difference favors bulls. Albeit small, it is completely opposite from an expiry below $32,000.If $32,000 fails to hold, bears will have a $9-million lead because only 9% of the call options have been placed at $31,000 or lower.Neither outcome is of extreme significance, but the profits could be used for the larger upcoming monthly options expiry on July 30. This is the primary reason why bulls need to hold their ground to keep the current momentum.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

100,"After having been hailed as a champion of sorts by many within the global digital asset market, Tesla CEO Elon Musk dropped a bombshell on the crypto community earlier in May, backtracking the company’s decision to start accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a means of payment for various automotive sales. The reason cited was that Bitcoin mining processes were too resource-intensive and unsustainable in the long run.As expected, almost overnight Musk became a heel, especially among Bitcoin maximalists who began calling him a sell-out and a market manipulator. Regardless of the name-calling, the episode did seem to shine a major spotlight on the energy consumption aspect of the crypto mining industry. This is best highlighted by the fact that recently, an increasing number of crypto companies have publicly announced their moves toward the use of greener energy alternatives.Earlier this month, publicly traded North American Bitcoin mining company Bitfarms revealed that it had been successful in its efforts to power nearly 1.5% of the Bitcoin network using 99% clean energy. Not only that, even the concept of carbon-neutral exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is quickly gaining traction globally, with many major investment management firms, including Toronto-based Ninepoint Partners LP, already taking steps to ensure exactly this.Lastly, BitMEX, a crypto derivatives trading platform, also recently announced its decision to go carbon neutral, while Marathon Digital Holdings, a United States-based Bitcoin mining firm, hopes to achieve its target of 70% carbon neutrality in the near future.To get a better sense of whether the mining industry is actually moving toward a greener direction, Cointelegraph reached out to Sam V. Tabar, chief strategy officer for Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin miner Bit Digital and former head of capital strategy for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. In his view, the “switch to green” is already happening rapidly across the global mining landscape, adding:When asked about his own company’s sustainability efforts, Tabar highlighted that despite powering nearly 2% of the global Bitcoin network, a vast majority of Bit Digital’s energy comes from carbon-neutral sources such as hydroelectricity, solar energy and other wind-based technologies.Additionally, he further highlighted that as the industry heads into an increasingly digitized future, more and more firm’s will enlist the services of well known independent Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) consultants to self-monitor, set targets, provide transparency and help improve their percentage of green electricity and other sustainability initiatives.He added: “We are currently working with independent ESG consultant APEX. By measuring our sustainability and mining footprint, we’re able to develop targets to continuously improve as we continuously shift towards 100% clean energy.”Providing his take on the renewable vs fossil fuel debate, Matt Hawkins, CEO of multi-algorithm CPU and GPU miner Cudo, told Cointelegraph that behind the scenes, several major players operating within this space have already started to transition to the use of renewable energy, something that he believes is a positive step forward for the crypto industry as a whole. He further added:Staying on the subject of China, Hawkins opined that the ongoing migration of hashing power out of the country should be viewed as a big positive, especially when it comes to the decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Tabar further believes that the ban on cryptocurrency-related activities has been a blessing in disguise for United States miners who have been seeking innovative ways to find clean energy in the United States.While a lot of talk surrounding renewable energy continues to circle around solar and wind primarily, North American mining and hosting firm Compass Mining announced that it had gone ahead and signed a 20-year deal with nuclear fission startup Oklo, providing the mining farm with 150 megawatts of energy once its mini-reactors are deployed within the next two to three years.Also, according to data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, nuclear reactors do not contribute to any type of air pollution when in operation. In this regard, Compass CEO Whit Gibbs believes that once his company switches to nuclear power, the cost of mining for his firm will drop “considerably.” Not only that, but Compass is also discussing with the crypto-friendly city of Miami about getting power from the Florida-based Turkey Point Nuclear Plant.On the matter of nuclear energy being explored by more mining farms in the future, Hawkins reiterated his belief that it “all comes down to cost efficiency,” adding that when the market is buoyant and bullish, Bitcoin mining is profitable across most regions, irrespective of the power costs incurred. He added:Earlier this month, Bitcoin experienced its largest difficulty drop in its decade-old existence after China decided to issue a blanket ban on its mining industry. Following this decision, BTCs difficulty ratio dramatically tumbled to 45%, resulting in many mining farms being able to produce higher quantities of BTC at a lower cost per unit.Ever since the ban, the move towards long-term sustainability has been extremely swift, with Musk recently hinting that the crypto industry may be on its way toward a greener future despite not rolling back Tesla’s decision to start accepting Bitcoin payments. Not only that, even recent data by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance suggests that there has been a decline in the amount of energy used to mine BTC.Therefore, time will tell how the future of the Bitcoin mining industry plays out from here on out, especially as more and more miners start to migrate to various crypto-friendly nations — such as those located in the Nordic countries or Central Asia — where there is a relative abundance of renewable energy."
101,"Way back in 2014, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that cryptocurrency is property in Notice 2014-21. That classification as property has some big tax consequences accentuated by wild price swings. Buying and selling crypto can trigger gain or loss and be taxable. Yes, buying something using crypto — a house, a car, a new suit — can trigger taxes. Even paying taxes in crypto can trigger taxes.If you owe $5,000 in taxes, you could pay the $5,000 in dollars. However, if you pay with $5,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC), as long as the crypto is worth $5,000 when you pay, you’re home free, right? Not really. You need to consider the sale you just made. The transfer of the crypto to the tax man is a sale, and that could mean more taxes for the year of the payment. If you bought the crypto for $5,000 the day you pay your taxes, there’s no gain.Related: More IRS crypto reporting, more dangerPaying employees or independent contractors in crypto results in taxes to them when they receive it. And when you pay them, you too can have a tax hit since, on your side of the equation, you just sold your crypto. If you are paying with crypto, remember that most transfers of crypto are taxable, unless the transfer qualifies as a gift or a charitable contribution. You can give crypto as a gift, and it doesn’t trigger income taxes. That’s right, no income tax to you as the donor, and no income tax to the recipient.Of course, when the recipient transfers or sells it, there would be income taxes then. And at that point, the donee would need to calculate gain or loss. What is his or her tax basis, since it was a gift? The tax basis is the same as it was in your hands when you made the gift. However, keep in mind that to avoid income taxes, a gift has to actually be a gift. The tax law is littered with cases of people who claimed something was a gift, but who got stuck with income taxes.Related: Things to consider when giving crypto to charities or othersWith gifts not being subject to income taxes, it can seem tempting to try to characterize money or property you receive as gifts. But be careful: The IRS hears this “it was a gift” excuse a lot. And the IRS is unlikely to be persuaded unless you can document it. Plus, the IRS usually expects a gift to occur in a normal gift-giving setting. For example, if an employer or former employer gives a loyal employee $10,000, is that a gift? No, it is a bonus, treated as wages. Even trying to document it as a gift may not change that result.True gifts may not trigger any income taxes, but there could be gift taxes involved. If you give crypto to a friend or family member — to anyone really — ask how much it is worth. If the gift is worth more than $15,000, it requires you to file a gift tax return. For 2021, $15,000 is the amount of the “annual exclusion.” You can give gifts up to this amount each year to any number of people with no reporting required. Any gifts over that $15,000 amount require a gift tax return, even though you may not have to pay any gift tax. Rather than paying gift tax, you normally would use up a small portion of your lifetime exclusion from gift and estate tax.What if your gift isn’t to a person, but to charity? If you give to charity, that can be very tax-smart from an income tax viewpoint. If you give crypto to a qualified charity, you should normally get an income tax deduction for the full fair market value of the crypto. If you bought it for $500, and donate to a 501(c)(3) charity when it is worth $15,000, you should get a $15,000 charitable contribution deduction.Related: Your crypto taxes can be donated to charity insteadWhat’s more, you won’t have to pay the capital gain or income tax on the $14,500 spread. That’s a good deal. It’s why most savvy people — think Warren Buffett — want to donate appreciated property rather than money to charity. Remember, if you use crypto to buy something, the IRS considers that a sale of your crypto. You have to calculate gain or loss. You might have bought something with your crypto, but you made a sale in the process.Plan B Passport offers clients who hold crypto a way to use their crypto to buy a second passport. Customers can take their pick of seven tax-haven nations that happen to exempt crypto holdings from capital gains taxes. You are buying into a citizenship by investment program, which is not illegal. You can keep your U.S. passport, or you could give it up if you wish. A key feature of the deal is the notion that you are making a donation of $100,000 or $150,000 to the sustainable growth fund of the country, plus some fees.However, it is worth asking if this is a real donation or is rather the purchase of citizenship. If the latter, one might expect the IRS to say that using appreciated crypto for the purchase triggers U.S. taxes. Remember, the IRS is still very much on the hunt for taxpayers not paying taxes on crypto.Related: Crypto staking rewards and their unfair taxation in the USHaving a second passport would be nice, but what about people who decide to give up American citizenship along with U.S. taxes?Ironically, that can bring yet another tax: the U.S. exit tax. To exit, you must prove five years of IRS tax compliance, and getting into IRS compliance can be expensive and worrisome. If you have a net worth greater than $2 million, or have average annual net income tax for the five previous years of $171,000 or more, you can pay an exit tax. It is a capital gain tax, calculated as if you sold your property when you left. A long-term resident giving up a Green Card can be required to pay the exit tax too.Most people exiting the U.S. arrange gifts, use formal valuations, pre-exit sales, and devise other plans to try to avoid or minimize their exit tax. But heck, if you do have to pay exit tax, perhaps you could pay with crypto? Well, as long as it was clear that the crypto would not trigger even more tax…This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal advice.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

104,"Anish Saxena, a New Delhi-based automobile dealer, made “incredible” profits by investing in cryptocurrencies in 2020, just as his business took a hit from the coronavirus pandemic-induced lockdown.“I had known about Bitcoin and Ethereum and dozens of other assets for years,” the 33-year old businessman said. “But I only got to invest in them after the lockdown pushed me and my family members out of work. And it helped us survive — big time.”Saxena revealed that he had allocated about 80% of his investment portfolio to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), with the rest of his capital distributed across Polygon, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Chainlink’s LINK. His crypto-only investment netted him great profits, the numbers of which Saxena declined to reveal. However, he did notice how he almost got half of his unrealized profits wiped by deciding not to liquidate ahead of the May 2021 crash.“I was liquidating cryptocurrencies based on my household demand for cash,” Saxena said. “While I am still in profits, seeing my profits decline by more than 50% has prompted me to get a huge portion of my investments back into cash.”Retail traders like Saxena have come under pressure due to over-reliance on the two most predominant cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ether.While different in terms of economics and use cases, both digital assets tend to move in the same direction. In recent history, their losses and profits appeared well-synced, illustrating that their holders might see their investments grow rapidly during bull trends but, at the same time, risk losing a lot when the uptrend exhausts and reverses to the bearish side.“If it is a pure crypto portfolio, then, of course, having two cryptos which are highly correlated with one another adds risk to the portfolio,” said Simon Peters, a crypto analyst at multi-asset brokerage company eToro.On the other hand, Liam Bussell, head of corporate communications at fiat-to-crypto gateway provider Banxa, called Bitcoin and Ether liquidity backstops for crypto traders.In his comments to Cointelegraph, the executive said that traders utilize their initial gains in the top two cryptocurrency markets to invest in mid and lower-cap digital assets, citing rallies in Dogecoin and across nonfungible token projects. He noted:Additionally, Peters advised traders and investors to counterbalance their crypto investment risks by allocating a good portion of their capital in traditional financial instruments, including stocks, commodities, and fixed-income securities/funds.“Historically, crypto has shown itself to be pretty uncorrelated to other asset classes and offers better risk-adjusted returns,” the analyst explained.Peters, meanwhile, reminded that the Ethereum network’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake — known as Ethereum 2.0 — might limit its correlation with Bitcoin.In detail, one of the principal features included in the upcoming Ethereum blockchain upgrade, called Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, is deflation and intends to burn a portion of transaction fees collected from users.That could wipe out at least 1 million ETH tokens every year from the circulating supply, thus making the asset scarcer, according to crypto education publication Coinmonks. Bitcoin exhibits a similar scarcity by reducing its newly issued supply rate by half every four years, a process called a halving. The cryptocurrency has a limited supply cap of 21 million tokens.Related: London fork enters testnet on Ethereum as difficulty bomb sees delay“It’s possible that a decoupling could occur between bitcoin and ether following the completion of the transition to 2.0, as the ‘tokenomics’ — how ETH works on the 2.0 blockchain — will be different to at present,"" said Peters, adding:As for Saxena, the novice trader said he would “hodl” on to a portion of his BTC and ETH.“If business picks up again after a full economy reopening, I’m planning to invest consistently across Bitcoin, Ethereum, gold and mutual funds,” he noted.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

105,"Decentralized derivatives exchange SynFutures announced a new product called Bitcoin (BTC) Hash Rate Futures that uses the biggest cryptocurrency’s ever-changing mining difficulty as a basis to open long or short positions. Touted as fully decentralized hash rate futures, SynFutures’ new offering would let users trade on Bitcoin mining difficulty with Wrapped BTC (wBTC). The hash rate and mining difficulty are two core mechanics of Bitcoin that have become even more popular with the miners’ exodus following China’s crackdown. The Bitcoin network requires mining difficulty to readjust in every 2,016 blocks to counter the Bitcoin hash rate — the amount of computing power dedicated to mining.As explained by Cointelegraph in detail, this two-way mechanism maintains a constant block time, or how long it takes to find each new block while mining Bitcoin. According to the announcement, SynFutures developed the Hash Rate Futures, now in closed alpha, by designing an oracle to validate Bitcoin block headers directly and extract the mining difficulty. Each futures contract represents the expected block mining reward in BTC for a difficulty resetting period at a given difficulty level.Miners would be able to short the Hash Rate Futures to hedge against the risk of mining difficulty increases or long electricity futures to determine the power cost.Related: How to mine Bitcoin: Everything you need to knowSynFutures founder and CEO Rachel Lin said that the team wanted to allow traders to hedge against all the factors affecting their mining returns.

107,"Three Arrows Capital CEO Su Zhu has announced the launch of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Tranchess.Tweeting on Thursday, Zhu described Tranchess as a “Tokenized Asset Management & Derivatives Trading protocol.”While the project aims to become a multi-chain and multi-asset DeFi protocol, with designs on becoming a decentralized autonomous organization, the first iteration of Tranchess focuses on Bitcoin (BTC).Tranchess 1.0 offers access to a BTC price performance tracker on a correlated basis. Since the project’s initial launch is on the Binance Smart Chain, users will need to have BTCB — the BEP-2 version of Bitcoin.According to the project’s white paper, users swap BTCB in exchange for QUEEN — the main native token. Alternatively, investors can acquire QUEEN with USD Coin (USDC) on supported exchanges.Ownership of the QUEEN token enables users to get involved in the protocol sub-fund or tranche. Keeping with the chess theme, the sub-funds are dubbed BISHOP and ROOK. Investors need only split their QUEEN tokens into BISHOP and ROOK on a 50-50 basis.Per Zhu’s tweet, farming on Tranchess allows single-asset staking in a bid to counter impermanent loss. “If you are holding BTC, create the Queen token. If you are holding USDC, create the Bishop token,” the 3AC chief added in the Twitter thread.Apart from farming, there is also the option of entering a leveraged long position on Bitcoin via the ROOK token. However, as pointed out by Zhu, “There’s no forced liquidation nor funding cost spike.”Related: Report: Impermanent loss on Uniswap and other AMMs is always permanentWhere swapping BTCB for QUEEN is dubbed the “creation” step, Tranchess users can also go in the other direction by exchanging their QUEEN tokens for BEP-2 Bitcoin — the “redemption” step. Before doing this, the user will have to merge the BISHOP and ROOK tokens back to a whole QUEEN “coin.”Back in July, Tranchess secured $1.5 million in seed funding from notable backers, such as 3AC, Spartan Group, IMO Ventures, LongHash Ventures and Binance Labs."
108,"Visa officially announced on Thursday that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Currencycloud, a fintech platform supporting about 500 banking and technology clients across more than 180 countries.The new acquisition aims to improve Visa’s foreign exchange business and expand them to serve financial institutions, fintechs and partners. The deal will specifically improve Visa’s payment transparency and speed, the company’s global treasurer Colleen Ostrowski said, stating:The new acquisition is based on an existing strategic collaboration between the two firms, as Visa already owns an equity stake in Currencycloud, valued at $956 million, including cash and retention incentives. Last year, Visa participated in an $80-million funding round for Currencycloud alongside investors such as Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Group.According to the announcement, Currencycloud will maintain its operations from the company’s headquarters in London and will keep its current management team. The acquisition is still subject to regulatory approval.Related: BlockFi starts shipping Visa-backed Bitcoin rewards credit cardsThe acquisition comes shortly after Currencycloud entered a partnership with Ripple, a major cryptocurrency company behind the XRP token. Currencycloud officially announced its collaboration with Ripple in early July in order to explore new mechanisms for cross-border transactions, particularly focusing on jurisdictions where regulations restrict opportunities for small and mid-size enterprises.A spokesperson for Visa told Cointelegraph that the companies will continue operating as separate entities until closing. “It is business as usual until then,” the representative stated.The latest acquisition comes as Visa moves forward with its commitment to digital currency adoption, actively embracing both major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and fiat-pegged stablecoins. Last week, Visa approved the issuance of a new Bitcoin debit card in Australia."
109,"As global cryptocurrency companies increasingly consider going public, the Russian central bank has officially recommended local exchanges to avoid crypto-related listings.The Bank of Russia issued an information letter on Monday, asking Russian stock exchanges to stay away from listings of foreign and local companies involved in a broad range of crypto services.The central bank elaborated that local exchanges should not list stocks issued by companies whose business relies on crypto market prices, including digital financial assets issued outside Russia, crypto-tracking indexes, as well as crypto derivatives and crypto funds. The Bank of Russia also recommended asset managers to exclude these instruments in mutual funds.The bank emphasized that stock exchanges should particularly avoid providing exposure to these investment services to non-accredited investors.“The Bank of Russia’s recommendations aim at a preventive measure — they are designed to prevent a mass investor adoption of such instruments,” the bank stated in an official notice on Thursday. The recommendations do not apply to central bank digital currencies and authorized digital assets issued in Russia, the statement reads.Related: Russia’s central bank to study crypto investment risksThe central bank went on to say that cryptocurrencies and digital assets are associated with high volatility, opaque price discovery, low liquidity, as well as technology and regulation-related risks. “Purchases of financial instruments linked to such assets entail increased risks of losses for people who do not have sufficient experience and knowledge,” the bank added.The Bank of Russia’s latest move further showcases the institution’s reluctance to embrace the cryptocurrency industry, echoing similar restrictions in countries such as China. As previously reported, the Russian central bank has been withholding major local banks such as Tinkoff from offering cryptocurrency trading."
110,"Bitcoin (BTC) circled $32,000 on Thursday after excitement over fresh comments by Elon Musk resulted in the strengthening of support.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD ranging between $31,500 and $32,000 overnight on Wednesday hours after Musk joined others in praising Bitcoin during a conference panel.As Cointelegraph reported, Musk’s words came over broadly positive and less critical than many had assumed they would be — this, in turn, led to a brief price surge that topped out above $32,800.Thereafter, familiar resistance kicked in, and $32,400 once more became the level to flip, a feat that Bitcoin has yet to achieve.Nonetheless, previous gains from below $30,000 remained intact, and there was equally little evidence of a major retracement about to kick in on Thursday.“If we look at the price action of Bitcoin, we can clearly see and state that we’re holding above $31K,” Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe said.Independent analyst and trader Keith Wareing was neutral about the Musk episode. He argued that since no resistance levels had truly cracked, nothing had fundamentally changed in the short-term BTC price landscape.Elon pump (yay)

111,"Charts turned green as Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied to $32,858, but a number of analysts also cautioned that the market may not be out of the woods yet. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the top movers over the past 24-hours were Telcoin (TEL), Polygon (MATIC) and Axie Infinity (AXS), indicating that the recovery is widespread and not just confined to large-cap cryptocurrencies.As seen in the list above, the top-performing tokens represent a variety of cryptocurrency subsectors, including nonfungible tokens, artificial intelligence and decentralized finance projects.Telcoin (TEL), a blockchain protocol focused on sending and receiving mobile-based global remittances, was the top performer over the past 24-hours.TEL rallied 71% from a low of $0.0091 on July 20 to an intraday high at $0.0158 to as its 24-hour trading volume surged 136% to $43 million.Interest in the project received a noticeable uptick following the introduction of “DeFi agents” on the Fetch protocol, which are designed to help users manage their liquidity and protect it from impermanent loss or rug pulls.The second-best performing token on the 24-hour charts is Polygon (MATIC), the popular layer-two solution for the Ethereum (ETH) network that has seen a significant increase in adoption over the first half of 2021.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for MATIC on July 20, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for MATIC first turned green on July 19 and climbed to a high of 77 on July 20 as its price reached a low of $0.62, just one hour before its price rallied 52% over the next 29 hours.The surging momentum for Polygon is in large part due to the release of Polygon Studios, the protocol’s “new arm for the blockchain gaming and NFT ecosystem.”Related: Trading firm of richest crypto billionaire reveals buying ‘a lot more’ Bitcoin below $30KThe third-best performer over the past 24-hours was Axie Infinity (AXS), an NFT-focused protocol that rallied more than 1,000% over the past month thanks to soaring user activity and the income opportunities it offers users in economically disadvantaged countries.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for AXS have been favorable for some time.As seen in the chart above VORTECS™ Score for AXS has been elevated for the majority of the past week and reached a high of 77 on July 20, around one hour before the price increased 46% over the next sixteen hours. Currently, AXS price trades at $18. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

112,"Bitcoin (BTC) is leading the recovery in crypto markets today after the price rallied back above the $32,000 level. Sam Trabucco, a quantitative trader at Alameda Research, said the firm had purchased the dip in Bitcoin on July 20. Trabucco said the sharp recovery in equity markets, fewer long liquidations in the crypto derivatives market and the possible end of FUD caused due to China mining ban and Grayscale unlocking could act as recovery catalysts that could boost the crypto rally further.However, analyst and podcast host Nebraskan Gooner views the recovery in Bitcoin as a shorting opportunity. Veteran trader Peter Brandt also expects Bitcoin to witness another downturn before a change in trend.The correction may open up opportunities for several new investors to enter the crypto markets.JPMorgan director of asset and wealth management Mary Callahan Erdoes said in a recent interview with Bloomberg that several of the bank’s clients want to invest in Bitcoin because they consider it as an asset class.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the levels where resistance may creep in.Aggressive selling by the bears pulled the price below $31,000 on July 19 and that was followed by another down move on July 20. However, the bulls purchased the dip below $30,000 today, resulting in a strong rebound.The bears will try to stall the recovery at the 20-day exponential moving average ($32,643). If the price turns down from this resistance, the sellers will again try to sink the BTC/USDT pair below the critical support at $28,000.If they succeed, the pair could start the next leg of the downtrend that could pull the price down to $20,000.Conversely, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could challenge the 50-day simple moving average ($34,599). A break above this resistance will be the first sign of strength and open the doors for a possible rally to $36,670.The long tail on the July 20 candlestick suggests that bulls purchased the dip to the strong support at $1,728.74. This is the third instance when Ether (ETH) has rebounded off this level since May 23.The rebound has gained momentum today and the buyers will now try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,008). If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($2,213) which could act as a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, the bears will again try to pull the price below $1,728.74. If they manage to do that, the pair could start the next leg of the downtrend that may reach $1,536.92.The buyers will have to clear the hurdle at the downtrend line to signal a possible change in trend.Binance Coin (BNB) has bounced off the $251.41 support today which is a positive sign. This suggests that bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.The buyers will now try to push and sustain the price above the downtrend line. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that bears are losing their grip. The BNB/USDT pair could then start its journey toward the overhead resistance at $433.Conversely, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, it will indicate that bears are selling on rallies. The sellers will then again attempt to pull the price down to the critical support at $211.70. A break below this support could complete a bearish descending triangle pattern and start the next leg of the downtrend.Cardano (ADA) plunged to the critical support at $1 on July 20 but the bulls aggressively purchased this dip, resulting in a strong rebound today. The relief rally could now reach the 20-day EMA ($1.25) where bears may offer a stiff resistance.If bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA. If the momentum clears this hurdle, the pair could rise to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will invalidate the bearish descending triangle pattern, which could open the doors for a rally to $1.94.Conversely, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will again try to sink the pair below $1. If that happens, panic selling may ensue and the pair could start its downward journey to $0.80 and then to $0.68.XRP has bounced off the critical support at $0.50 today, indicating that bulls are attempting to defend this level aggressively. The rebound could rise to the 20-day EMA ($0.61), which is likely to act as a stiff hurdle.If the price once again turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to pull the price below the $0.50 support.If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair could resume the downtrend. The next support is at $0.45 and then $0.40. Alternatively, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that bears are losing their grip. The pair may then rise to the overhead resistance at $0.75.Dogecoin (DOGE) has once again bounced off the $0.15 support today, suggesting that bulls are aggressively attempting to defend this level. The relief rally could now reach the overhead resistance at $0.21.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone indicate that bears will try to stall the rally at $0.21. If the price turns down from this resistance, the DOGE/USDT pair could again drop to $0.15 and remain range-bound for a few days.A breakout of $0.21 will be the first sign of strength and could result in a rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.26). On the contrary, if the price turns down and plummets below $0.15, the pair may witness panic selling and could drop to $0.10.Polkadot (DOT) plummeted near the psychological level at $10 on July 20 where buying emerged. This has resulted in a strong recovery today.The buyers may face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($14). If the price turns down from this resistance, bears will again attempt to sink the DOT/USDT pair below $10. If they succeed, the downtrend could extend to $7.80.Contrary to this assumption, if bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could move up to the 50-day SMA ($17.82). A breakout and close above this resistance will signal a possible change in trend.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from the overhead resistance at $16.93 on July 19 and started its southward march toward the next critical support at $13 but the bulls had other plans. They purchased at lower levels today, resulting in a strong recovery.The up-move could face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($17.89). If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears may fancy their chances and will again try to sink the UNI/USDT pair below $13.If they succeed, the pair could start the next leg of the downtrend and slide to the psychological support at $10. Conversely, if bulls propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may reach the downtrend line. A breakout of this resistance will indicate that bears are losing their grip.Related: It is time for the US to create a ‘Ripple test’ for cryptoBitcoin Cash (BCH) dropped to $383.53 on July 20 from where it is attempting to start a relief rally. This suggests that bulls are accumulating at lower levels.The pullback could reach the 20-day EMA ($465) where bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the sellers will make one more attempt to sink the BCH/USDT pair below $370.If they manage to do that, the decline could extend to the next support at $330. On the other hand, if bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may rally to the overhead resistance at $538.11.Litecoin (LTC) plunged below the $118 support on July 19, completing a bearish descending triangle pattern. The decline had pushed the RSI into oversold territory, suggesting that selling was overdone in the short term.The LTC/USDT pair has started a recovery today and may retest the breakdown level at $118. If bears flip this level into resistance, the pair could make one more attempt to resume the downtrend. A break below the $100 psychological support could start the next leg of the down move that may reach $70.On the contrary, if bulls push and sustain the price above $118, the pair could climb up to the 20-day EMA ($127) where bears may again try to stall the relief rally. If they succeed, the pair could again turn down but if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, a rally to the 50-day SMA ($145) is possible.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

113,"There's no doubt that the last couple of months have been bearish for Bitcoin (BTC), but throughout this entire period, derivatives indicators have been relatively neutral. This could be because cryptocurrencies have a strong track record of volatility, and even 55% corrections from all-time highs are expected.After two months of struggling to sustain the $30,000 support and finally losing it on July 20, the futures premium and options skew turned bearish. Even PlanB's stock-to-flow valuation model was not expecting prices below $30,000 for the current month. The model uses the stock-to-flow ratio, which is defined by the current number of Bitcoin in circulation and the yearly issuance of newly mined Bitcoin.On-chain analytics show that the monthly average of 36,000 BTC withdrawn from exchanges is usually interpreted as accumulation. However, this superficial analysis fails to acknowledge the increased use of tokenized Bitcoin in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.The chart above shows that 40,660 BTC have been added to Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and RenBTC (RENBTC) over the past three months. This number does not consider deposits at BlockFi, Nexo, Len and the multiple services that provide yield on user's cryptocurrency deposits.Removing Bitcoin previously deposited on exchanges could be a sign that traders' intent to sell in the short term is reduced. Still, at the same time, it might also represent investors seeking higher returns in other avenues. In short, these coins might have been sitting on exchanges as collateral or as a long-term holding.As previously mentioned, derivatives indicators flipping negative should hold more weight than assumptions on the bullish or bearish interpretation of on-chain data. In an initial analysis, analysts should review the futures contracts premium, which is also known as the basis.This indicator allows investors to understand how bullish or bearish professional traders are because it measures the difference between monthly futures contracts and the current spot market price.A neutral basis rate should be between 7% to 15% annualized. This price difference is caused by sellers demanding more money to postpone settlement, a situation known as contango.However, when this premium fades or turns negative, this is a very bearish scenario known as backwardation. July 20 was the first time that the indicator sustained a negative 2.5% level for longer than twelve hours.At the moment, professional traders are likely leaning bearish after Bitcoin lost the critical $30,000 support, but further confirmation can be gained from looking at options markets.Related: Here's one way to trade Bitcoin even as BTC price teeters over an abyssUnlike futures contracts, there are two different instruments in options. Call options provide the buyer with upside price protection, and the put option is a right to sell Bitcoin at a fixed price in the future. Put options are generally used in neutral-to-bearish strategies.Whenever the put-to-call ratio increases, it means the open interest on these neutral-to-bearish contracts is growing, and it is usually interpreted as a negative signal. The most recent data at 0.66 still favors the call options, but these instruments gradually lose ground.Currently, there's enough evidence of bearishness in the futures and options markets, and this hasn't been the case over the past two months. This suggests that even pro traders lack confidence after the $30,000 support failed to hold in the past 48-hours.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The changes are designed to increase transparency and reduce risk to the market. The new requirements that will go into effect in November include new counterparty protections, requirements for capital and margin, internal risk management, supervision and chief compliance officers, trade acknowledgement and confirmation, and recordkeeping and reporting procedures. Starting next February, for instance, swap data repositories will be expected to disclose data about individual transactions to the public.Gensler clarified:Toward the end of his speech, Gensler said trade reporting rules will apply to cryptocurrencies if the products are security-based swaps:Related: Is it time for the US to create a ‘Ripple test’ for crypto?Any offer or sale to retail participants must be registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

The Chairman of the Federal Reserve took a hard line on the need for stricter regulations for stablecoins on July 14, going on to discuss the possibility of a U.S. digital dollar before Congress last week. A bill was also introduced to Congress that is meant to provide greater legal definition to digital assets and reduce the fear of future regulations with regard to blockchain-based tokens.

Apart from the planned valuation, other listing details like trading ticker and the start of actual public trading are yet to be revealed as of the time of writing.The SPAC merger and subsequent Nasdaq listing will see Core join the ranks of fellow publicly-traded Bitcoin mining companies in the United States like Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital.Core CEO Mike Levitt revealed in an interview that the company had mined over 3,000 BTC since the start of 2021 with the firm holding 1,683 Bitcoin, currently valued at $53 million as of the time of writing.The company reportedly earned $60 million in revenue for 2020 and is projecting an eight-fold increase in 2021. Indeed, North American miners are banking on the crypto mining disruptions in China to increase their earnings in 2021.Levitt also described the company’s mining infrastructure framework as “unparalleled,” stating that Core holds over 70 patents in blockchain-related patents.Operating out of locations in the Midwest and Southern United States, Core’s possible $4.3 billion valuation will put the firm at double the market capitalization of other rivals like Marathon, and Riot Blockchain.Related: Four North American Bitcoin miners that could benefit from the East-West shiftWith Bitcoin mining stocks continuing to remain a useful way to gain indirect BTC exposure for some institutional investors, several miners are electing to go public.

117,"United Kingdom-based crypto fund Nickel Digital Asset Management released a survey of 100 wealth managers and global institutional investors to find out the biggest investor concerns associated with crypto. The survey features respondents from the United States, France, Germany, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom, who collectively own $275 billion in assets under management.Conducted online from May to June 2021, the survey found low confidence among institutional investors in crypto security, with 76% of respondents citing concerns about the security of custodial services as one factor stopping them from investing in crypto. Respondents also identified the regulatory environment as a significant hurdle. Other important concerns included a lack of transparency and volatility, and a perceived lack of reputable fund managers offering crypto investment.Nickel Digital co-founder and CEO Anatoly Crachilov said that institutional concerns over crypto custody and security come despite the industry seeing “very strong progress on that front.” Crachilov stated that crypto service providers have been increasingly deploying sophisticated cryptographic solutions, such as distributed keys and multi-party computation vaults, while traditional financial institutions have been also moving into such services.Related: BNY Mellon joins State Street to service new crypto exchange“We are now seeing Fidelity, BNY Mellon, and State Street entering the market, thus further reinforcing market infrastructure.

118,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) painful plunge below $30,000 on Tuesday turned into a so-called “buy the dip” opportunity for Alameda Research, a Hong Kong-based quantitative trading firm and liquidity solutions firm headed by FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried.Quantitative trader Sam Trabucco revealed late Tuesday that the company purchased Bitcoin during its latest price decline, adding that the company’s cautious strategy to go long BTC/USD surfaced out of at least three “recovery” catalysts: a potential end to the ongoing crypto FUD (China ban, Grayscale epic unlock, etc.), the stock market’s intraday recovery, and weaker long liquidations in the derivatives market.“In my view, all these points [to] a similar (if vague) direction,” Trabucco wrote.And all these led to Alameda doing what we do best -- buying a LOT more over the past day or so.

The cryptocurrency established an intraday high at $31,669 on the FTX exchange, which just raised a record $900 million. Later, the price corrected lower, albeit minimally, thus showcasing limited selling pressure near the said sessional peak.Meanwhile, Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with AvaTrade Ltd, highlighted Bitcoin’s resilience to recent bearish outlooks, with some earlier noting that a close below $30,000 would have the cryptocurrency move lower violently.“In reality, that is not what we have seen,” the executive told Bloomberg. “The Bitcoin price has been stable, and we have not seen any panic selling.”But Jeffrey Wang, head of Americas at crypto finance startup Amber Group, provided a cautious outlook. Speaking to Cointelegraph, the former Morgan Stanley executive said that Bitcoin continues to trade under the global risk-on influence, which may subject the cryptocurrency to further losses. He continued:Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at Oanda, also weighed negatively on the latest Bitcoin–Wall Street correlation. He noted that if the United States stock indexes enter into the “panic selling mode,” it would lead the flagship cryptocurrency lower in tandem.“It is critical that the digital coin regains ground above the $30,000 level, as a significant breach could result in a massive technical selloff,” Moya wrote in a Tuesday note.Related: $13K Bitcoin price predictions emerge with BTC falling below historic trendlineAs for Alameda, Trabucco admitted that the company had realized downside risks in the Bitcoin market, but its latest accumulation spree has been focusing more on the cryptocurrency’s long-term outlook.

The institutional-grade platform is expected to be a fully automated over-the-counter market for cryptocurrencies, featuring physical delivery and bank custody.According to the report, BNY Mellon and State Street, alongside other unnamed banks behind Pure Digital, will create a cash cryptocurrency trading venue in a bid to compete against larger industry players. “We have spoken to all the top-tier banks but we think custody banks were some of the first to see demand, so they are now more advanced,” Pure Digital CEO Lauren Kiley said.Pure Digital co-founder Campbell Adams reportedly noted that the firm expects to roll out trading “within a week,” with the first trade tentatively involving a Bitcoin trade. The executive also said that Pure Digital is not worried about collaborating with banking institutions, expressing confidence that the bank’s contribution is important for the industry’s adoption. “The crypto market needs banks, I don’t think it can scale without them,” he stated.Related: Goldman Sachs’ crypto trading desk expands to EtherThe latest news marks another milestone for cryptocurrency adoption by financial institutions in the U.S., with both BNY Mellon and State Street becoming increasingly engaged in the industry. After announcing crypto custody plans in February, BNY Mellon continued moving into crypto, last week becoming an exchange-traded fund service provider for major crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments.State Street is known for its digital currency collaboration with the Winklevoss’ Bitcoin exchange, Gemini. Last month, the bank launched a dedicated digital finance division focusing on cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and central bank digital currencies."
121,"Despite Bitcoin (BTC) not yet emerging as an “asset class per se,” JPMorgan considers it important to meet the demand for cryptocurrency investment, according to a senior wealth management executive.A large number of JPMorgan clients see digital currencies like Bitcoin as an asset class, the company’s director of asset and wealth management, Mary Callahan Erdoes, said.In a Bloomberg interview released Tuesday, Erdoes stressed that the bank will continue providing crypto services to meet the growing demand, stating:Erdoes said that the debate about whether cryptocurrencies constitute an asset class is still ongoing, as many experts are concerned about the market’s extreme volatility.“It’s a very personal thing. We don’t have Bitcoin as an asset class per se,” Erdoes stated, adding that it remains to be seen whether the cryptocurrency is a store of value. “The volatility you see in it today just has to play itself out,” she concluded.One of the largest investment banking institutions in the United States, JPMorgan is known for its somewhat mixed stance on crypto, with CEO Jamie Dimon referring to Bitcoin as “fraud” back in 2017. The company has since softened its stance on the industry, reportedly preparing to launch an actively managed Bitcoin fund as well as launching debt instruments with direct exposure to a basket of crypto-focused companies.Related: BlackRock CEO signals low demand for crypto from long-term investorsJPMorgan analysts have been closely monitoring the crypto market, with crypto expert Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou forecasting that Bitcoin will hit $145,000 as its long-term “theoretical target.” In late June, JPMorgan said that institutional investors had little appetite for buying the dip, with strategists reiterating that Bitcoin would be trading between $23,000 and $35,000 over the medium term."
122,"15 years ago, the social media application Twitter was launched. You might have heard of it, it’s pretty big. Initially, the microblogging and social networking service was a friendly place, packed full of helpful articles and adorable videos. In a recent article, aptly titled ‘How Twitter ruined everything,’ the author Douglas Murray wrote, somewhat nostalgically, “It all started out so well."" Jack Dorsey’s brainchild was once, believe it or not, fun. People used the platform to say wacky things, but fun wacky, not QAnon wacky. Oh, how times have changed.Twitter, in many ways, has gone from being a heavenly place to an utterly hellish one: A once Edenic environment has become a dystopian nightmare. Cat videos have been replaced by catty comments, with more and more people using the platform to unleash tweetstorms — a stream of consciousness in 280 characters or less.Jackson Palmer, the co-creator of Dogecoin (DOGE), is the latest to use Twitter for such purposes. In a tweetstorm of epic proportions, Palmer managed to capture the attention of both crypto-enthusiasts and critics, calling cryptocurrencies “an inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology.” The whole industry, according to the inventor, is an exploitative hustle, capitalizing on the naivety of the less well off. According to Palmer:The cryptocurrency industry leverages a network of shady business connections, bought influencers and pay-for-play media outlets to perpetuate a cult-like “get rich quick” funnel designed to extract new money from the financially desperate and naive.News flash, Mr. Palmer: You just described the world we live in. The world's 2,000 billionaires possess more wealth than almost 5 billion people combined. This is one of the very reasons why Bitcoin (BTC) was launched in the first place. The world is rigged in a way that allows the super-rich to profit while the world burns. This might sound hyperbolic, but I assure you it's not.In this inherently corrupt world, decent cryptocurrencies — like Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin, for example — do offer the non-billionaires, all 7.8 billion of us, some degree of hope. As the barriers to entry are virtually non-existent, with basic knowledge, a willingness to educate oneself on the topic and a reasonably small amount of money, one can make decent profits from decent cryptocurrencies. Of course, like everything in life, there is always a degree of risk involved; caution must always be exercised. But to write off the whole crypto-market, as Palmer did, makes little sense. If in doubt, just ask the president of El Salvador.Related: What is really behind El Salvador’s ‘Bitcoin Law’? Experts answerWhen we discuss “exploitative” actors, it is important to discuss traditional banking services — possibly the most exploitative of them all. With financial intermediaries like Western Union charging exorbitant handling charges, migrants lose almost $25 billion each year through remittance fees. Why can't a decent cryptocurrency (or cryptocurrencies) offer people a less exploitative alternative? An alternative, after all, is most definitely needed.According to a recent United Nations report, around 11% of all people globally “are supported by funds sent home by migrant workers.” As the report explains:In other words, some 800 million people around the world stand to benefit from an alternative to Western Union, the all-consuming, remittance goliath.Again, why not crypto? As the report states, “the money received is key in helping millions out of poverty,” as “it is often a major part of a household’s total income in the countries of origin and, as such, represents a lifeline for millions of families.” Imagine how much stronger this lifeline would be if the $25 billion in remittance fees went towards food and shelter, rather than the pockets of the exploiters.This is not a fantasy projection. The current system is very much broken, and a change is very much needed. According to the Pew Research Center, the wealth gap between America's richest and poorest families has more than doubled in size since 1989, and that gap is only increasing. While Amazon employees defecate in bags, their once billionaire boss, Jeff Bezos, engages in a pissing contest with Richard Branson....in space. The landscape must be transformed.Can cryptocurrencies help? Yes. How so? By giving a voice to the voiceless; by giving the most vulnerable a greater degree of financial autonomy. Not all cryptocurrencies are created equally. For every Bitcoin or Ether, there are nonsensical, dog-themed meme coins; Palmer would do well to remember this before writing the whole crypto-market off.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

123,"Bitcoin (BTC) is rebounding despite the ongoing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) unlocking events — and most shares are already released.According to data from tracking resource Bybt, the remaining unlockings combined involve fewer shares than those released on just one day last weekend.Sunday saw around 16,240 BTC worth of GBTC shares end their six-month lock-up period. The largest such release in a single day, the event saw a hefty build-up, with arguments raging over its likely impact on the Bitcoin price.Monday’s BTC price dip was timely when it came to GBTC, fitting a narrative that a sell-off would follow such large releases.Even if that were true, Bitcoin hodlers now have a silver lining — unlockings are only scheduled until Aug. 25, and the outstanding shares are fewer in number than Sunday’s tranche.In reality, however, supporting evidence for unlockings resulting in sell-offs is lacking. As various sources stress, Bitcoin markets themselves are in fact left out of such events altogether — GBTC shares cannot be redeemed for BTC, which could then theoretically be dumped for cash or stablecoins.“Grayscale just had the biggest GBTC unlock today and nothing exploded,” popular Twitter commentator Lark Davis wrote on Monday, citing the Bybt figures.That “FUD” had nonetheless infiltrated some of the best-known names in finance, including banking giant JPMorgan.“Selling of GBTC shares exiting the six-month lockup period during June and July has emerged as an additional headwind for bitcoin,” a report claimed earlier this month.As Cointelegraph reported, meanwhile, interest in GBTC and Grayscale’s other products remains.Related: Grayscale ‘100% committed’ to turning GBTC into Bitcoin ETF — CEOBoth Rothschild Investment Corp and Ark Invest have added to their holdings in July, the latter boosting its Bitcoin exposure by an additional 310,000 shares.“GBTC’s doing hundreds of millions of dollars a day in notional trading volume, and it really is the easiest way for many investors to add crypto exposure alongside stocks, bonds, ETFs, other things they may own,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told Bloomberg Monday.A survey of institutions by asset manager Fidelity likewise revealed positive long-term approaches to cryptocurrency, with 71% of responses planning a market entry in the future."

126,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices broke below a long-standing support wave that was instrumental in keeping its strong bullish bias intact after March 2020's crypto market crash.Dubbed the 50-week simple moving average, or 50-week SMA, the wave represents the average price traders have paid for Bitcoin over the past 50 weeks. Over the years, and in 2020, its invalidation as price floor has contributed to pushing the Bitcoin market into severe bearish cycles.For instance, the 50-week SMA acted as support during the 2018 bear market. The wave helped prevent Bitcoin from undergoing deeper downtrends — between February 2018 and May 2018 — as its price corrected from the then-record high of $20,000.Similarly, the wave provided Bitcoin with incredible support during its correction from its $15,000 high in 2019. Moreover, it held well as a price floor until March 2020, when the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a global market crash.Pseudonymous chartist ""Bitcoin Master"" shared concerns about Bitcoin's potential to undergo an 80% average price decline upon breaking bearish on its 50-day SMA. The analyst noted that if the said fractal plays out, BTC/USD exchange rates could crash to as low as $13,000.#Bitcoin just tagged the 50-week simple moving average, let's see if the coin doesn't break tradition of bouncing at least 50% ($47k) from it before making the usual 80% decline ($13k) from ATH.#bitcoin dropping after the weekly candle opened below the structure I’ve been watching for a few weeks now.

The analyst recommended that investors should not dump their Bitcoin holdings right away on initial dips below the wave.""Selling Bitcoin on initial dips below its 50-week moving average in the past has proven a good way to lose money, even in bear markets,"" McGlone explained.The latest Bitcoin dip came in the wake of a global risk-on market decline driven by fears that the highly transmissible Delta variant of COVID-19 would slow down the recovery generated by the reopening of economies.Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, noted that Bitcoin could drop further. In comments to Bloomberg, the former Google executive said the BTC/USD exchange rates could fall to as low as $20,000. Nonetheless, he anticipated the pair to retest $40,000 on the next bounce.“We’re going to need to form another base first before resuming another bull trend,” Ayyar noted.Jehan Chu, the founder of cryptocurrency-focused venture capital and trading firm Kenetic Capital, placed a safe downside target near $25,000 but warned about accelerated sell-offs should bulls fail to log a rebound from the level. He said: However, another analyst offered a different, more optimistic perspective on the current position of Bitcoin. James Wo, founder  CEO of the global crypto investment firm Digital Finance Group, highlighted on-chain indicators, including an ongoing decline in exchange inflows and active wallet addresses, as a reason to stay bullish on Bitcoin.""Looking at these on-chain indicators, we can say that the majority of investors are waiting for major signals to enter the market again,"" Wo told Cointelegraph.Related: Bitcoin bull outlines 7 steps to more fiscal stimulus and higher BTC pricesData provided by CryptoQuant, a South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm, also provided a bullish setup for Bitcoin, citing the cryptocurrency's market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio.In detail, the MVRV ratio represents an asset's market capitalization divided by realized capitalization. When the figure is too high, traders may interpret Bitcoin's price as being overvalued, thereby implying selling pressure.

127,"The European Commission has submitted a new proposal that would require crypto-asset service providers to collect additional Anti-Money Laundering information from those who utilize cryptocurrency for money transfers. The stated purpose of this proposal is to prevent the further propagation of money laundering activity within the European Union.Under this proposal, service providers conducting transfers must have the name of the originator of the transfer, the account number, where the account exists and where it is used to process the transaction. The originator’s address, official personal document number, customer ID number, or date and place of birth would also be required under the proposal. Service providers would similarly need to ensure that the name and account number of the beneficiary are included with the transfer, along with information about where that account exists. The beneficiary’s crypto-asset provider would also need procedures in place to detect whether the information for the originator of the transfer is included or is missing.Related: French government pushes for one agency to regulate crypto across the EUThese additional information requirements would kick in when a transfer exceeds 1,000 euros or when a series of payments appears to be linked and the total exceeds 1,000 euros, “in order not to impair the efficiency of payment systems and crypto-asset transfer services and in order to balance the risk of driving transactions underground as a result of overly strict identification requirements against the potential terrorist threat posed by small transfers of funds, ” the commission says in the proposal.In cases where there is a series of payments exceeding 1,000 euros that do not appear to be connected, the payment service provider would not need to verify the information unless it “effects the pay-out of the funds in cash or in anonymous electronic money” or the provider “has reasonable grounds for suspecting money laundering or terrorist financing.”Related: EU eyes new money laundering regulator and stricter crypto reporting requirementsThe updated requirements were part of four legislative proposals put forth by the European Commission on Tuesday.

128,"A recent sell-off in the Bitcoin (BTC) market pushed its prices below the key psychological support of $30,000.While the cryptocurrency's move downhill prompted many analysts, including Luno exchange's Vijay Nayyar and Kinetic Capital's Jehan Chu, to predict a further depressive move below $25,000, Anthony Pompliano offered a contrasting bullish outlook.The Morgan Creek Digital Assets founder pitted risk-on markets against the fears of the fast-spreading Delta variant of COVID-19. He noted that governments, on the whole, would introduce ""more aggressive monetary stimulus"" programs should the new coronavirus strain spread at the scale of its Alpha version.""History is not necessarily an indicator of the future, but it is hard to imagine a scenario where if we had a second wave of lockdowns, we wouldn’t also get more aggressive monetary stimulus efforts,"" Pompliano wrote in a newsletter.In saying so, Pompliano envisioned that the road to more dollar liquidity would like come in seven successive stages, as shown in the snapshot below:Pompliano's statements appeared as the Bitcoin market fell in sync with other risk-on assets across the globe on July 2.For instance, all three Wall Street indexes — the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average — logged their steepest declines in weeks. Also, gold fell to as low as $1,795.12 an ounce but later recovered to $1,812.145 an ounce.Meanwhile, United States government bonds rallied alongside the dollar, showing that investors are heading for safe-havens amid the global market turmoil.Behind the rout, global media outlets reported, was a growing list of worries about economic recovery. The Delta variant of COVID-19 has spread rapidly, reigniting the dialogue in several countries about whether authorities should reimpose lockdown and curb economic activity.""The hope was that [COVID-19] vaccines would provide us with the endgame,"" Mohammed Kazmi, a portfolio manager at Union Bancaire Privee, told the Financial Times. ""Now investors are looking at the UK and there’s a bit of fear with regards to reopening so aggressively when cases are still so high.""Kazmi added that markets are now stepping back from hopes of a V-shaped recovery and are feeling uncertain about the future of their economies.Related: Stock-to-flow model possibly invalidated as Bitcoin price loses $30KPompliano's comments also appeared as the Federal Reserve flirted with the idea of hiking its near-zero lending rates by the end of 2023 to curb rising inflation.Additionally, several central bank officials also favored the idea of tapering their aggressive $120 billion per month asset purchase program, although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell clarified that the Fed intends to run the quantitative easing policy hot until the U.S. economy recovers completely.James Wo, founder and chief executive officer of global blockchain and digital asset investment firm Digital Finance Group also noted that even though the Bitcoin industry has encountered downside volatility during this current market cycle, the fundamentals that have driven the value of its and other markets higher all across 2020 continue unaffected.

129,"Bitcoin (BTC) breaking below $30,000 has cost it almost all of its 2021 bull run gains — but a historic silver lining is ready to rescue bulls.Data from crypto exchange Binance's order book confirms that BTC/USD has almost dipped to the strongest support zone ever seen.It has been a rough 24 hours for Bitcoin hodlers, and the rout doesn't seem to be over yet. After losing 6% overnight, BTC/USD hit lows of $29,300 — $300 below where it opened at the start of the year.With that, despite reaching lofty highs of $64,500 just three months ago, Bitcoin is de facto back where it started before the most intense phase of its latest bull run kicked in.Those who fear that all is lost — at least for the short term — may be happy to discover that that same level currently hosts the biggest Bitcoin ""bid"" ever seen.As revealed on July 20 by ""Material Scientist,"" the creator of monitoring resource Material Indicators, BTC/USD is now being propped up by unprecedented demand.""We just hit the largest bid ever,"" Material Scientist summarized.The idea of Bitcoin breaking below current levels is, nevertheless, far from fantasy for traders, with predictions of $24,000 or even a $14,000 ""Armageddon scenario"" circulating online.Additional order book data from Binance shows relatively little resistance between the spot price and $35,000, something that could make a rebound easier to engineer.At the time of publication, Bitcoin circled $29,700 as relative stability returned to the market.Meanwhile, the latest figures covering investor activity around Bitcoin have produced some surprising results.As noted by statistician Willy Woo on July 20, it is now the smaller hodlers who are amassing BTC, even as the largest whales divest themselves of their holdings.Related: Rothschild Investment Corp has increased its Bitcoin exposure by 300% since April""Wee little fishies are going parabolic,"" he commented.This makes 2021 look more akin to 2013 than 2017 in terms of post-halving bull run years, a common narrative in recent weeks."
130,"As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to struggle around the $30,000 mark, the widely accepted stock-to-flow (S2F) model to price Bitcoin, coined by Twitter user and unnamed Dutch investor Plan B, is now the farthest from its estimates. The model was popularized by the Twitter pseudonym more than two years ago in March 2019 and amid a minor bull through Q1 2019. It’s considered to be one of the leading quantitative valuations for the first-ever scarce digital currency. The model presumes that scarcity of certain assets or commodities drives its price.The S2F model is an attempt to price Bitcoin in a way similar to scarce commodities, such as gold, silver, etc. The essence of it is that assets like Bitcoin, gold and silver have only limited supply injections in a certain period of time when compared with commodities like oil, copper and steel, where the supply flow is higher and considered to be theoretically limitless. Since Bitcoin has a maximum supply limited to 21 million tokens and considering the time- and energy-intensive mining process, there is only a certain number of new Bitcoin that can come into circulation in a certain timeframe. The premium cryptocurrency had fit right into this model, until now. Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin Global — a cryptocurrency exchange — told Cointelegraph:He went on to say that models like these are usually built on historical data and that while some periodic trends can help identify the general direction of the market, specific trends can often be difficult to track in advance.According to the S2F model, BTC’s price is supposed to be at $88,531 on July 20, which is nearly three times the current price. In fact, earlier this year, PlanB suggested that Bitcoin could hit $450,000 before the end of this year in the best-case scenario, and $135,000 in the “worst-case scenario.“ Furthermore, the model predicts that Bitcoin is expected to have hit its much-awaited $1 million mark in July 2025.However, in a PlanB Twitter poll on June 21, 41% of respondents thought that Bitcoin would remain under $100,000 this year.This is compared to the 16% that believed the same back in March when Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $55,000. PlanB went on to say that Bitcoin prices deviating from the S2F model make even him feel “a bit uneasy.”The model, as the name would suggest, uses the stock-to-flow ratio to value Bitcoin. This ratio is defined by the current number of Bitcoin in circulation at a given time and the incoming flow of newly mined Bitcoin. As evident in the chart describing the model, historically, Bitcoin has traced the price estimates in a fairly accurate fashion at most times.As pointed out by Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovski Capital, the negative S2F deflection — the ratio between the market price of Bitcoin and the S2F ratio — is now the highest it has ever been in the history of the token. He went on to say that for believers in the S2F model, this is a great time to buy Bitcoin, as this price drop could be perceived as an unexpected dip.Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, spoke with Cointelegraph on the limitations of the S2F model, saying: One of the major changes in the past year for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency markets as a whole is the high rates of institutional and retail adoption that have drastically increased since March 2019. Another important factor in this demand and adoption dynamic is the COVID-19 pandemic that has plagued the world for more than 19 months now. Lai elaborated more on this, saying:The Musk effect, combined with various other factors, such as the mainstream popularity of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), has played a large role in raising awareness about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general. Lyu touched upon this changing scenario in the cryptocurrency market as well, saying, “The emerging projects and altcoins on the market with diversified application scenarios will distract investor attention and diversify their existing investment portfolios, thus continuously fluctuating the Bitcoin market.” This change is evident in the fact that, since the beginning of this year, Bitcoin’s dominance as the premier cryptocurrency has fallen from over 60% to its current 46.3%, signifying a growing altcoin sector.In a recent example of the shift in demand and adoption dynamic since the inception of the S2F model, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Fund (GBTC) recently underwent several share unlockings across July, with the biggest on July 18. This expiry further increased the continual downward pressure on Bitcoin, causing it to drop further to trading around $30,500 on July 19, dropping from nearly $32,200 on July 18 before the expiry. In the past — when the S2F model initially became prevalent — there wasn't institutional demand that could heavily impact the market in a short amount of time.While the S2F model is one of the most widely known quantitative models that predicts Bitcoin’s price in the short term (less than five years), there are several other models that are often used to gauge its price potential. Daniele Bernardi, founder of the PHI Token project and CEO of Diaman Partners Ltd. — a fintech asset management company — explored some of these models in a recent paper. Bernardi evaluated the inadequacies of the S2F model, stating to Cointelegraph:Instead, Bernardi prefers the rate of adoption model, which he explores in his paper. He stated that, according to this model, the “fair price” of Bitcoin can be around $60,000, but not more than that. This estimate is based on the “actual users of Bitcoin and the wallets created.” He went on to explain the probability of PlanB’s S2F model actually coming into fruition this year: “Of course, anything can happen, but from my point of view, there is less than 20% of probability, based on Monte-Carlo simulations, that the Bitcoin price will reach a value greater than $100,000 in 2021.”Related: Forecasting Bitcoin price using quantitative models, Part 3That said, it is important to remember that Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $18,000 for a few days in the March 2017 bull run and went straight to trading at $64,000 in March 2021. There are not many assets in financial markets that have witnessed gains at these levels within such a short time span. Bernardi explained the impact of this growth:Fair value or not, Bitcoin seems to be in a period of turmoil, more often than not facing downward pressure on the token since the flash crash on “Black Wednesday” n May. However, positive institutional news keeps flooding in. Most recently, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said that Grayscale is “100% committed” to turn GBTC into a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund."
131,"Ralph Hamers, CEO of Swiss bank UBS, has said he does not fear missing out on crypto. Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Hamers said, “Clients are looking at different alternatives, and they hear about crypto, and there is a bit of a fear of missing out as well. They read it in the papers, but they also see the volatility.”Commenting on the bank’s approach to providing exposure to crypto for its wealth management clients, the UBS CEO stated:Back in May, reports emerged of UBS planning to offer crypto investments to wealthy clients. At the time, the proposed product was limited to a small fraction of the portfolios held by the bank’s wealth management clientele due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies.However, in June, the bank warned customers to avoid crypto investments, stating that the market will crash under pressure from regulators.Meanwhile, the Swiss branch of Spanish banking giant BBVA already offers Bitcoin (BTC) trading and custody solutions for clients in the country.

132,"Billion-dollar investment firm Rothschild Investment Corp quadrupled its exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) since April, new records show.In a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Saturday, Rothschild confirmed that it now owns 141,405 shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). A quiet but nonetheless substantial player among institutions, Rothchild Investment Corp has also invested in Grayscale’s Ether (ETH) equivalent, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.Its exposure to Bitcoin has increased considerably this year, the filing shows — in April, its GBTC shares totaled 38,346.In BTC terms, with each GBTC share equal to 0.000939767 BTC, Rothschild thus has an equivalent Bitcoin exposure of 132.8 BTC ($3.94 million).The data implies that declining prices have not fazed executives, while Bitcoin has been maintaining a drawdown for three months after hitting its all-time highs of $64,500 in mid May.As Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein noted this week, institutional players are likely taking little notice of short-term price moves, instead concentrating on a much lower-time-preference strategy when it comes to cryptocurrency.“Investors in this asset class are really not focused on... short-term movements in price,” he told CNBC.On Monday, Ark Invest purchased a reported 310,000 GBTC shares of its own, bringing its combined holdings to 8.81 million or 0.5% of its portfolio. At its peak, GBTC represented 0.9% of the ARK portfolio in late March.As Cointelegraph reported, Grayscale is at the center of discussions this week, as it unlocked over 16,000 BTC worth of GBTC shares on Sunday.Related: Institutional demand for Bitcoin evaporates as BTC struggles below $31KConcerns, while arguably unfounded, long abounded that the event would create downward Bitcoin price pressure, with the sharpening of the drawdown on Monday and Tuesday fuelling the fire.Regardless, since GBTC investors cannot redeem shares for BTC and then sell for fiat currency, Bitcoin markets are in fact left out of the equation when it comes to unlockings.Grayscale itself only sells a tiny amount of the Trust’s BTC holdings for fund management purposes."
133,"The CEO of Osprey Funds — the issuer of over-the-counter Bitcoin trust OBTC —isn’t holding his breath for a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the United States this year.Speaking to Yahoo Finance’s Jared Blikre and Seana Smith on July 19, Greg King said he believes that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the leadership of Gary Gensler has so many things on its plate in 2021 that a BTC ETF approval is unlikely to make the cut.King recalled the hype in the crypto industry surrounding Gensler’s appointment, who, while fairly noncommittal in his statements about crypto regulation thus far, is nonetheless well-known for his work teaching courses on blockchain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in recent years. “You saw a flurry of filings, from established companies to sort of newcomers, chasing that Bitcoin ETF idea,” said King. The CEO has himself been in conversation with SEC staff for several years, as Osprey — the parent firm of Osprey Funds — had filed for its own Bitcoin ETF back in 2017. King argued:Disappointed expectations of a “slam dunk” may, moreover, have played a role in the market’s correction this summer, with King claiming that the “market's partially calibrating” to these frustrations.While for King, the high number of Bitcoin ETF applications in the U.S. earlier in the year fed into Bitcoin’s extraordinary 2021 bull run, with their stalling later contributing to a downturn, he also added that recent hawkish regulatory remarks in the U.S. regarding private stablecoins has not been “particularly helpful for Bitcoin or Ethereum.”This week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has told members of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets — a.k.a the “Plunge Protection Team” — that the government must act quickly to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Earlier this year, Yellen had also warned that the abuse of crypto has been an ever-growing problem.Over at the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell has echoed Yellen’s calls, saying that if stablecoins are “going to be a significant part of the payments universe, then we need an appropriate regulatory framework which, frankly, we don’t have.”Related: Grayscale ‘100% committed’ to turning GBTC into Bitcoin ETF — CEOLooking at this landscape — and given that crypto ETFs have already been approved in Canada, Europe and other jurisdictions — King said that the U.S. is “decidedly behind” but that “that's obviously by choice”:"

135,"Iris Energy, a Sydney-based Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm that invests in data centers powered by renewable energy sources, reportedly plans to raise new funds ahead of the expected Nasdaq listing.Bloomberg reported that the new fundraising round is looking to raise roughly $200 million to prepare for the United States exchange listing. Iris Energy has already met with prospective investors and plans to go for the Nasdaq listing before the end of the year.The report calls up earlier talks on special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), which would enable a potential U.S. listing aimed at $300–$500 million for the green energy BTC miner. However, Iris Energy now prefers a private placement or raising funds by offering equity shares instead of a SPAC deal, since the latter would have diluted the existing investors’ stakes.Iris Energy started its initial public offering (IPO) journey long before green mining in Bitcoin became a hot debate.

136,"Bitcoin (BTC) failed to regain $30,000 after losing support on Tuesday as Fear & Greed indexes raced each other to the bottom. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD continued trading in the $20,000–$30,000 zone on Tuesday.The largest cryptocurrency saw a turbulent night’s price action, abruptly adding to existing losses to seal 24-hour negative returns of -6%.The move came in tandem with a souring sentiment on traditional markets.

137,"Despite Bitcoin (BTC) crashing below $30,000 for the first time in one month, on-chain metrics suggest whales may be steadily accumulating BTC.According to Glassnode’s Monday “The Week On-Chain” report, the Bitcoin reserves of centralized exchanges have continued to evaporate despite the recently sustained bearish momentum, with an average of 36,000 Bitcoin (worth roughly $1 billion) being withdrawn from exchanges monthly.Glassnode infers the shrinking Bitcoin reserves on exchanges as indicating large investors moving BTC into secure storage rather than leaving their coins on exchanges in preparation for selling.Glassnode also identified a recent increase in the number of entities hodling Bitcoin since May, which increased from roughly 250,000 to nearly 300,000 today. Glassnode describes “an entity” as a unique on-chain cluster of associated addresses.The on-chain analytics provider noted that the number of “sending entities” — unique address clusters associated with selling — has fallen by roughly one-third from 150,000 to 100,000, while “receiving entities” — addresses linked to accumulation or holding — have increased by roughly 20% from 190,000 to 250,000 over the same period.Despite emphasizing signals suggesting accumulation, Glassnode noted heavily divided market sentiment, predicting extreme volatility may be imminent for the markets:Related: Traders are withdrawing 2,000 BTC from centralized exchanges dailyIt added that miners are now also in accumulation mode despite expenses incurred in the great migration in the wake of China’s mining crackdown.

139,"The rocky road that Bitcoin (BTC) has been on for the past two months continues as a widely predicted move downward materialized in the early hours on Monday and dropped the price of BTC below $31,000. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that a wave of mid-day selling pushed the price of BTC to a low of $30,400 before bulls arrived to provide support and lift the price back to $30,850.The market as a whole continues to face an uphill battle as the miner exodus following China’s crackdown on the mining industry has led to the fourth consecutive negative adjustment in the Bitcoin mining difficulty, a figure that has fallen by almost half since mid-May.Insights into the current state of the Bitcoin network were provided in the newest report from Glassnode, which set the stage by looking at the UTXO Realized Price Distribution, a metric that identifies on-chain volume profiles across different price groupings.Current data shows that 10.5% of the circulating supply of BTC has transacted in the range between $31,000 and $34,300, the highest level seen since a price of $11,000.While this indicates a healthy level of volume at the current level, it’s important to note that should BTC’s price break lower, the next significant support levels are at $26,500, $23,300 and $18,800.The market-wide pullback in May has led to a significant decline in interest from institutional investors, who now appear to be in risk-management mode as BTC’s price struggles to climb higher.Evidence of the decline in interest can be found by looking at the market price of GBTC, which continues to trade at an -11.0% to -15.3% discount, or by observing the net inflows to the Purpose ETF, which has slowed down significantly. Data from Glassnode shows that the exchange-traded fund (ETF) saw a net outflow of -90.76 BTC, which is its largest outflow since mid-May.Although institutional activity has been muted, on-chain deposits of BTC to exchanges continue with more than 28,700 BTC, the largest inflow in over a month and a half, taking place on Friday.Inflows during times of consolidation and corrections are often seen as negative developments, as they can result in increased selling, which can lead to a short-term price breakdown.Glassnode also pointed to the net inflow of 1,780 BTC to over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks in the past two weeks as “moving against the structural trend of outflows in place since November 2020.”Glassnode said:Related: Institutions cautious as crypto products post weakest volume since OctoberThe cryptocurrency market wasn’t the only market that faced downward pressure on Monday as a surge in COVID-19 cases led to a pullback in global financial markets.The S&P 500, DOW and Nasdaq all closed the day down 1.59%, 2.09% and 1.06%, respectively.Out of the top 200 cryptocurrencies, the only two notable performances of the day were a 24% gain for Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (BTCST) and a 17% rally from Dash.The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.245 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 46.3%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

140,"Every once in a while, a new indicator pops out that can be used to detect price tops and bottoms in the market. This assertion is even more evident in cryptocurrencies because the data comes from exchanges and on-chain data extracted from the blockchain.These indicators are constantly monitored and commented on by analysts and traders. Some of the lesser-known metrics use data from altcoin derivatives volumes and the Bitfinex U.S. dollar lending rate.The futures contract volume is usually triple that of, or even five times higher than, regular spot markets. This phenomenon is not exclusive to cryptocurrency markets, as these contracts allow leverage trading, but the comparison isn't exactly fair because the contracts are synthetic products, while Bitcoin (BTC) is digitally scarce.By measuring the market share of Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and the remaining altcoins, it is possible to analyze exactly what traders are focusing on.The chart above shows that Bitcoin and Ether represented 65% to 85% of the aggregate volume in March. Still, as altcoins gained relevance, this figure dropped to 45% for the first time ever on April 6. 11 days later (April 17), the total cryptocurrency market capitalization tanked 20%.This phenomenon repeated itself on May 6 as the Bitcoin and Ether market share in derivatives volumes reached a historical low at 39%. On May 10, the total market capitalization dropped 12%. It seems like too much of a coincidence, and it makes sense to consider whether the market overheats whenever the market share held by altcoin derivatives spikes.There are multiple reasons to relate a sharp increase in altcoin volume to excessive optimism. For example, changing focus from Bitcoin and Ether indicates that investors no longer see much upside and are seeking options elsewhere.Margin trading allows an investor to leverage their trading position by borrowing money. For example, borrowing dolla will allow one to buy Bitcoin, thus increasing their exposure. Although there's an interest rate involved with borrowing, the trader expects BTC's price appreciation to compensate for it.Whenever there's excessive demand for the dollar lending rate, it is usually an indicator that the market is becoming reckless.The above data shows that such an event happened four times in 2021, and the last one occurred on April 13, one day before the $65,800 all-time high for Bitcoin. For example, reaching a 0.16% daily rate is equivalent to a 5% monthly fee, which is costly even for the most optimistic investors.Traders should keep in mind that markets can remain irrational longer than any investor can remain solvent. This means that irrationality can prevail for long periods, including altcoin euphoria and the excessive use of leverage by buyers.Whenever multiple indicators point to an overheating market, traders should always consider reducing their positions. Going forward, the altcoin futures market share and the Bitfinex dollar lending rate should be carefully monitored when searching for market tops.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

141,"The government of France has proposed that the European Securities and Market Authority, or ESMA, should regulate digital currency activity across the European Union.If enacted, this would establish a single authority over the crypto sector across the trading bloc and would create uniform regulations across the union through ESMA, as suggested by the French securities regulator, Autorite des Marches Financiers, or AMF.The AMF’s proposal states:Last year, proposals were made for an EU-wide regulatory framework for digital currencies. ESMA is a Paris-based financial regulatory agency that seeks to strengthen investor protection in the EU, improve the functioning of financial markets and foster cooperation between member states.Related: EU securities regulator warns about risks of ‘non-regulated’ cryptocurrenciesIf the AMF’s proposal is adopted, it would look to capitalize on the experience ESMA has in regulating digital currency and would provide legal certainty for digital currency businesses operating across the EU.Regulating digital currencies has become a major point of discussion for governments across the world.

142,"China’s ongoing crackdown on Bitcoin (BTC) mining resulted in a mass relocation of mining operations out of the country and it has led to a more than fifty percent drawdown in the Bitcoin network hashrate from an all-time high of 197.9 exahash per second (ehash/s) on April 15 to its current rate at 97 ehash/s. One token that was hit especially hard by the hashrate drop was the Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (BTCST), a project that collateralized the Bitcoin hashrate with each token representing 0.1 TH/s of Bitcoin mining power.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTCST recently began to show signs of recovery after its price rallied 57% from a low of $13.57 on July 18 to an intraday high at $27.38 on July 19 as the Bitcoin hash rate begins to stabilize near 100 ehash/s.Three reasons for the recent boost in BTCST include increased earnings due to the decline of the Bitcoin network hashrate, the ability to stake BTCST to earn rewards and a functioning community governance system that is able to compensate users who lose funds while being liquidity providers for the ecosystem.While the decline in the BTC hash rate has widely been seen as a negative, the BTCST ecosystem actually benefited as the declines in mining difficulty translated into increased earnings per token.Since each token represents 0.1 TH/s of Bitcoin mining power, the earning power of each token has increased by 34% as a result of the reduction in total hashpower, which in turn, provides increased rewards for participants in the ecosystem.While the entire #Bitcoin hashrate has dropped significantly during the past few weeks, Standard Hashrate Group has maintained a stable hashrate of 150 Petahashes.

This means that the total amount of #BTC we reward #BTCST stakers daily has increased by over 34% to an ATH!A second reason for the growth seen in BTCST is the growing number of opportunities to earn a yield through staking or providing liquidity.As seen in the image above, BTCST holders currently have the opportunity to stake their tokens to earn rewards paid out in BTCB, which is the wrapped version of BTC on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), or the native BTCST token.The platform also includes options for staking or earning Dogecoin (DOGE), shown above as DOGE or Tau DOGE (τDOGE), but at the time of writing the APY offered was listed at 0%.Related: Malaysia is literally crushing thousands of illegal Bitcoin minersA third reason for the recent strength seen in BTCST is the recent passage of STP 14, which is a one-time compensation plan for liquidity providers who suffered losses as a result of the recent ‘Restorative Rebase’The #BTCST Community has passed STP 14: τAsset Liquidity Provider One-Time Compensation Program!

Liquidity providers on partnered swaps like @PancakeSwap who were impacted by Restorative Rebase will receive a one-time compensation equivalent to the Tau Asset and amount affected.Tau assets on the network include τBitcoin and τDOGE and they are primarily used as a staking token that pays out rewards in τDOGE.The passage of a new governance proposal suggests that the project is attempting to respond to negative developments and user’s loss of funds within the ecosystem but it is yet to be seen whether the current rally will find the momentum to continue higher.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

The bulls may attempt to stall the decline at the psychological level at $100 but if they fail, the decline could extend to the next support at $70.Contrary to this assumption, if the price recovers and rises back above $118, it will suggest buying at lower levels. The bulls will then again attempt to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($130).

144,"The ongoing United States-China trade war is in its fourth year. Former U.S. President Donald Trump saw different results from what he initially expected: America has taken a hit from higher tariffs and sanctions against Chinese companies and hasn’t benefited from it nearly to the same extent. It has cost the country up to 245,000 jobs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce calculated that the situation puts the exports of each state at risk. For example, the damage to Florida’s exports alone has already reached $1.9 billion.At the same time, China was taking a smarter approach: It not only imposed reciprocal sanctions and exported its products through intermediary countries (Vietnam, Taiwan and Mexico), but also made the U.S. pay for unsecured and poorly regulated assets — cryptocurrency.Related: US-China trade war and its effect on cryptocurrenciesThe United States annually inject billions of dollars into the Chinese economy without even suspecting it. The reason is that the majority of Bitcoin (BTC), which is exchanged mainly for U.S. dollars worldwide, is mined in China. It hosts 65% of all mining farms.To earn Bitcoin rewards, powerful computers solve complex math problems 24/7. Part of the newly mined coins goes directly to crypto exchanges, while the rest can be kept in the miners’ crypto wallets, but is eventually sold to dollars. On average, 900 BTC are mined every day, and the total daily revenue is about $31 million (as of the end of June). That means that in just a year, the miners have earned over $10 billion.Taking into account China’s share of mining farms, the local miners have earned about $7 billion since last summer. If both the price of Bitcoin and its popularity keep increasing, the revenue will double or even triple each year. In one way or another, the money will circulate throughout the country's economy: It will be spent, saved or invested.Related: Forecasting Bitcoin price using quantitative models, Part 1The Chinese government is well aware of the volume and significance of U.S. dollar investments through cryptocurrencies. Despite the heavily increasing regulation, the authorities are obviously not going to ban Bitcoin.China restricted crypto transactions for banks and payment companies back in 2013. In 2017, the authorities also shut down local crypto exchanges and blocked access to foreign platforms. That said, locals could legally own cryptocurrency all this time. What we see now is essentially a reminder of the previous restrictions imposed on financial institutions instead of the introduction of new ones. On one hand, the Chinese authorities want to prevent the “transmission of individual risks to the social field,” and on the other hand, they leave the door wide open for foreign investors.At the same time, the Chinese authorities have begun to restrict mining, which concerns many people on the market. The official reasons are excessive energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions that prevent the country from achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. But the real situation is a bit different from official statements.Related: Death knell for Chinese crypto miners? Rigs on the move after gov’t crackdownFirst, the Chinese miners already source cheaper hydroelectricity, which is highly developed in southern provinces, and only switch to fossil-based fuel during the dry winter season when they migrate to the north.Secondly, the authorities have fully banned new mining projects and the existing ones in three regions: Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang. Other provinces that are rich in hydropower resources, like Yunnan or Sichuan, are in no hurry to impose a total ban. While Yunnan was planning to shut down only illegal BTC mining farms “with a campaign against misuse of electricity,” later in June it was reported that all mining farms in Yunnan Province were shutted down.Chinese authorities seem to be putting things in order rather than declaring war on cryptocurrencies. The technological limitations of the Bitcoin supply are to work in China’s favor: It allows the country to influence the price of the crypto while keeping it in miners’ possession and without selling it on financial markets. However, if the restrictions keep tightening, the mining power may be redistributed between other countries. The Chinese mining equipment manufacturers — BTC.TOP, Huobi and HashCow — announced that they are suspending domestic sales and expanding their international presence, including to North America.At face value, the possibility of Chinese miners moving to North America seems beneficial to the United States. But experts pointed out that the continent doesn’t have a lot of idle energy capacity. Besides, moving countries takes time that competitors can take advantage of.The idea of taking control over not only crypto transactions but also Bitcoin mining is quickly gaining traction in developing countries. In Iran, mining has become one of the most accessible industries amid tough U.S. sanctions. The Iranian government is taking almost the same path as China: The authorities are to ban the use of cryptocurrencies generated abroad, but they allow paying for imported goods with domestically mined coins. Over the past year, Iran earned more than $400 million from cryptocurrency mining, with the United States’ revenue being only twice as much.Another country planning the development of mining projects is El Salvador — the first country to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender — that U.S. President Joe Biden refused to visit. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele is considering capitalizing on ""very cheap, 100% clean, 100% renewable"" energy from local volcanoes.Related: What is really behind El Salvador’s ‘Bitcoin Law’? Experts answerIn this context, Kazakhstan seems to be the most politically neutral country. Here, a huge mining center by Enegix with a capacity of 180 MW, and up to 50,000 mining rigs will start operating in September. What’s more, Chinese manufacturer of mining equipment Canaan has set up a new service center in Kazakhstan.China might exploit the export of their crypto farms as a means to further weaken the U.S. economy, while the U.S. government has no significant leverage to stop the dollar outflow caused by crypto transactions. Imposing a crypto ban for Americans would simply be undemocratic.The only option for the U.S. government is to weaken the appeal of Bitcoin through every possible means. This would explain why Elon Musk, the owner of some of the largest American companies, Tesla and SpaceX, suddenly switched from supporting Bitcoin to criticizing its environmental impact.Related: Experts answer: How does Elon Musk affect crypto space?The same thing happened to Greenpeace, which no longer accepts crypto donations, even though it had been doing so for the past seven years. It seems that the escalating campaign against Bitcoin has more to do with politics rather than the environment.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

145,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $31,000 support on Monday after sideways trading gave way to downside pressure. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting local lows of $30,630 on Bitstamp on Monday.Coming a day after Bitcoin's lowest weekly close since December 2020, the price action underscored the sensitivity of a market with low volume and network fundamentals still in their recovery phase.Traders had broadly predicted a move downward after Bitcoin had failed to hold on to support levels higher up, with the integrity of $30,000 itself being called into question.“Volatility, finally for Bitcoin,” in-house trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized.At the time of writing, BTC/USD circled $30,700 with daily losses at around 3%. A glance at buy and sell orders on major exchange Binance showed considerable demand remaining at $27,000 and upward, reducing the likelihood of a deeper dive beyond that area.Among market participants, it was all about catching the likely price bottom.Not saying this is the bottom.

I'm just saying the PA always looks horrible at the bottom, and that the bottom is only too obvious when it's too late to catch it.

A possible overall explanation lay at the door of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which on Sunday completed a 16,000-BTC unlocking event, which only a day later could have an opportunity to impact the market.Today, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told CNBC in an interview that the regulatory discussion on Bitcoin exchange-traded funds is entering its ‘’final stages’’ and that the company is committed to turning GBTC into such a product."
146,"Last week, Cointelegraph reported on the seizure of 3,800 PlayStation consoles allegedly being used to mine cryptocurrency. The confiscated gaming units were among a stash of hardware discovered by Ukrainian authorities during a raid on a farmhouse accused of tampering with electric meters to steal power from the local grid.Based on the initial reports at the time, the PS4 consoles, graphics cards, processing units and other hardware found at the scene was being used for illegal crypto mining operations.However, according to an investigation by Ukrainian business publication Delo, the seized PlayStation consoles were being used to generate content packs and coins for FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT), a game mode in the popular FIFA football game title.Players usually have to earn FUT coins and cards by winning football matches in the game, but the busted warehouse was allegedly generating black market variants of these in-game items. According to Delo, Ukraine’s Secret Service has yet to confirm or deny its findings, with the agency electing to keep details of the ongoing investigation under wraps.Related: Ukrainian police seize 3,800 PS4 consoles used for illegal crypto miningCointelegraph’s initial report did cast doubts on the likelihood of the illegal operation being used for crypto mining stating:However, using gaming hardware to mine cryptocurrencies is not unheard of and has in fact been linked with graphics processing unit (GPU) shortages for non-crypto mining users. Increasing demand for GPUs from miners coupled with a global semiconductor shortage saw budget PC gamers unable to secure next-generation graphics cards for their hardware."
147,"The head of crypto investment giant Grayscale believes that only a “couple of maturation points” separate the United States from its first Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).Speaking to CNBC on July 19, Michael Sonnenshein reiterated that a U.S. ETF is a matter of “not ‘if,’ but ‘when.’”Regulators currently have 13 ETF applications under consideration, and the U.S. lags behind neighboring Canada when it comes to giving them the green light.Years of applications and rejections have gone by, and some believe that an ETF would ultimately create bearish price pressure for Bitcoin in the long term.Nonetheless, Grayscale CEO Sonnenshein says the firm is “100% committed” to transforming its Bitcoin product, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ($GBTC), to ETFs once conditions are right.“I think in our seat, from our view of the world, we’re really looking for a couple of different points of maturation in the underlying market, and that’s really the final stages of what we think regulators need to approve those types of products and give investors the protections that they’re looking for,” he told the network.Last week, Grayscale announced a partnership with U.S. banking giant BNY Mellon, which will now provide services for GBTC when it undergoes its metamorphosis.GBTC is already in the headlines in crypto circles over its unlocking events, the largest of which occurred Sunday, with opinions mixed over their potential price impact.Institutional advances continue to surface this month despite low volumes and overall lack of direction on the market.Related: Historically low spot volumes and investor indecision weigh on Bitcoin priceAs Cointelegraph reported, Bank of America reportedly gave the green light for Bitcoin futures trading last week.A survey meanwhile showed that existing institutional BTC investors are far from done with the asset, with 40% saying they plan to buy more in future."
148,"Amid the ongoing crackdown on cryptocurrency mining in China, mining new Bitcoin (BTC) continues getting easier as BTC has experienced another mining difficulty drop.On July 18, the Bitcoin network posted its fourth consecutive negative adjustment of mining difficulty, dropping 4.8%, according to data from Bitcoin explorer BTC.com.The latest mining difficulty adjustment occurred at block 691,488, reducing the difficulty rate from 14.4 trillion to 13.7 trillion, the lowest level recorded since June 2020. The difficulty metrics have now almost halved over the past two months, after reaching over 25 trillion on May 13.The latest Bitcoin mining adjustment follows a series of consecutive difficulty drops that started with a nearly 16% decline on May 29. Further negative adjustments continued with a 5.3% drop on June 13 and a massive 28% decline on July 3 — the biggest mining difficulty drop on the Bitcoin network.Related: Bitcoin miner revenue jumps by 50% in 4 days since record difficulty dropBitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to mine a BTC block, with a higher difficulty requiring additional computing power to verify transactions and mine new coins. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks, or about every two weeks, as Bitcoin is programmed to self-adjust in order to maintain a target block time of 10 minutes.Bitcoin’s continuing mining difficulty decline comes in response to the ongoing miner migration out of China caused by a major crackdown on the cryptocurrency mining by local authorities. The ongoing difficulty drop falls in parallel with declining Bitcoin hashrate as well as decreasing average BTC transaction fees."
149,"Bitcoin's (BTC) current price slump has failed to dampen some experts' optimism regarding the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. In a new survey by personal finance comparison platform Finder.com, half of the respondents believe Bitcoin will surpass fiat money, or central bank-issued currencies, by 2040. While the sampling is arguably narrow — Finder.com says the report is based on a panel of 42 cryptocurrency experts — it shows that Bitcoin’s price crash from April’s all-time high didn’t impact the long-term perspective of crypto professionals.The survey reveals that 50% of the respondents expect to see the moment that Bitcoin overtakes global finance, also known as hyperbitcoinization, within the next 20 years. One-third of participants believe the event will occur before 2035, while 44% predict that Bitcoin will never become the dominant form of global finance.El Salvador’s move to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender is just the beginning of developing nations’ adoption of BTC as the primary currency, a majority of respondents say. 33% of the crypto experts expect the original cryptocurrency to become the most common form of money in developing countries within the next 10 years. Another 21% believe that we will see the adoption, but it will take 10 years or more.One thing panelists agree upon is the environmental concerns surrounding Bitcoin mining. A whopping 93% expects the green energy debate will continue to hurt Bitcoin, with 31% believing that energy consumption will significantly impact the price.Related: ‘Billion of users adopting Bitcoin? Maybe in 10 years,’ says Dan HeldYet, more than half of the experts don’t think moving to an environmentally friendly Proof-of-Stake model is the answer despite the potential price repercussions, as 66% of respondents called the proof-of-work model a “necessary evil.”In an exclusive interview, Kraken Head of Growth Dan Held told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin has a good chance of becoming the world’s reserve currency, but it will take at least 10 years. He said that in developing countries, Bitcoin is mainly valuable for avoiding censorship — while in the Western world, Bitcoin is attractive as a hedge against central banks' money-printing."
150,"Bitcoin (BTC) emerges into a new week with middling price action and optimistic fundamentals — what could the coming days have in store?Still holding $30,000 support, there’s little about Bitcoin to truly excite traders, but volatility has already reminded them of its presence over the past week.As a recovery in mining continues, everyone is playing a game of “wait and see” when it comes to the 2021 Bitcoin bull market.Cointelegraph takes a look at five things that might give BTC price action some direction in the short term.It’s a classic summer picture in equities — a slight comedown last week followed all but constant gains, with caution coming from COVID-19, inflation and other triggers.This time of year, however, is renowned for its lack of action, and even recent changes amount to little on a wider scale.“The Covid backdrop is just one of several factors that may be adversely impacting the reflation trade,” Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note quoted by Bloomberg.The United States dollar gained some strength from the modest shake-up in stocks, with the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) climbing toward 93.As Cointelegraph reported, DXY’s inverse correlation to Bitcoin remains in the spotlight for some — a short-term peak for the index may correspond to price pressure for BTC/USD.Another focus is oil on the back of a lessening of tensions among OPEC+ members and a fresh agreement to boost output. While traditionally less impactful on Bitcoin behavior, any unexpected volatility can provide fuel for a low-volume cryptocurrency market.This was witnessed last week, as reports of Bank of America greenlighting Bitcoin futures trading for select clients swiftly sent BTC/USD $1,000 higher.Actions by another bank, namely the U.S. Federal Reserve, may be more important this week. A working group on stablecoins will get the attention of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen when it is convened with the goal of “intra-agency work.”On spot markets, Monday began with hope for the future rather than confidence in current price events.The weekend saw seesawing from BTC/USD, still unable to beat resistance at $32,000 or higher but likewise apt to avoid tests of $31,000 support.At the time of writing, $31,750 formed a focus on lower timeframes, with ranging firmly the defining feature of the hourly chart.“It's time for a green week for Bitcoin,” popular trader Michaël van de Poppe ventured.Talk of if and when a Bitcoin price bottom could occur remains a major talking point. As Cointelegraph noted on Sunday, the drawdown from the most recent all-time high of $64,500 has now lasted for three months — the second-longest ever within a bull cycle.With popular opinion favoring a return below $30,000, van de Poppe argued that a bottom may not be as dramatic as expectations demand.“A bottom usually doesn’t look great, as the majority of the people are expecting further downwards movements of the markets,” he told Twitter followers.That candle did indeed disappoint, with Sunday’s weekly close on BTC/USD being its lowest of 2021 so far.For trader and analyst Rekt Capital, an ability to reclaim $32,000 is a problem in itself, opening up the path to levels around $29,000.“Bitcoin is threatening to lose its Weekly support (~$32000). Today is the last day for $BTC to reclaim this support,” he warned Sunday alongside an accompanying chart.In contrast to price, Bitcoin’s network fundamentals continue their march back to strength after the unprecedented events of May and June.The network hash rate, still holding up above its local low of 83 exahashes per second, has not seen any further major setbacks as miners relocate away from China.The real signs of progress, however, come from difficulty.This weekend’s automated readjustment saw difficulty dip by a modest 4.8% — a pleasing contrast from prior estimates. Two weeks beforehand, difficulty was forecast to decrease more than ever — by almost 29% — which slowly improved through the two-week difficulty cycle.Now, Bitcoin is on track to have its first positive readjustment since before the May price crash.The changes speak to Bitcoin’s unflinching ability to monitor itself and incentivize miners back to the network while continuing to process transactions unhindered.As such, commentators believe that the worst of the recent upheaval is firmly in the past.“The hangover of a difficulty adjustment downwards from the China crackdowns should conclude after this adjustment,” Kevin Zhang, vice president of Digital Currency Group mining advisory subsidiary Foundry Services, said at the weekend.Meanwhile, both the hash rate and difficulty have dipped below their levels at the May 2020 block subsidy halving.On-chain indicators are anything but bearish, but it’s the sustained nuanced signals that are on the radar this week.Specifically, funding rates across exchanges have remained neutral or lightly negative throughout the recent price volatility — a hopeful insight into traders’ mindset.As Cointelegraph reported, large whales appear alone in being apt to sell at current levels, with other investor profiles conversely buying up the supply.In terms of volume, however, a $30,000 Bitcoin is predictably uninteresting. Both futures and PayPal volumes have decreased significantly, the former returning to levels from late last year.The weekend’s price action was accompanied by fluctuating bets among large-volume investors.Short positions on Bitfinex, a driver of short-term volatility as witnessed throughout the past weeks, ebbed and flowed.What I'm watching:

Shorts unwinding since July 15th.

Probably nothing. #Bitcoin ... get some. pic.twitter.com/GLWVeoab6yOn Monday, shorts were decreasing further as the market waited for cues over general direction."
151,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls have successfully defended the $30,000 level in the past few days but the failure to achieve a strong rebound has some traders worried that the price will eventually dip to new lows. In a series of tweets, Ecoinometrics said that the current correction “looks very similar to 2013” when Bitcoin took 197 days to rise to a new all-time high and a bottom formed after a 69% correction from the all-time high.If history repeats itself, then traders may need to be patient because the current correction has only been in play for 95 days. At $30,000, Bitcoin has just dropped 54% from its all-time high, and a 69% correction could sink it down to $20,000.In a new report, Delphi Digital highlighted that trading activity had collapsed with spot exchange volumes having fallen more than 60% from the highs in May. The derivatives market has also seen an exodus of leverage traders and the Bitcoin futures open interest is back to the early 2021 levels.Delphi Digital considers this a bullish sign as they believe that “stronger-handed participants are the ones primarily contributing to current open interest levels.”Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the short term.Bitcoin is attempting to bounce off the $31,000 support but the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests that buying dries up at higher levels. The bears will now once again try to sink the price below the $31,000 support.The 20-day exponential moving average ($33,174) is sloping down and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the negative zone, suggesting that bears have the upper hand. If sellers sink the price below $31,000, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to the next support at $28,000.The $31,000 to $28,000 zone is critical for the bulls because if this zone cracks, the sentiment will sour further and could lead to long liquidation. That could intensify selling and result in a drop to $20,000.Contrary to this assumption, if bulls sustain the rebound and push the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($34,925), it will signal that the selling pressure is reducing. That could increase the possibility of a break above $36,670.The bulls pushed the price above the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart but they could not clear the hurdle at the 50-SMA. This suggests that bears continue to sell on rallies. The bears will now again try to sink the price below the $31,000 support.If they succeed, the pair could drop to $30,000 and then to $29,000. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 50-SMA. The short-term trend will shift in favor of the bulls if the pair rises above the downtrend line.Polygon (MATIC) has been correcting for the past few days and the price has reached the strong support zone at $0.74 to $0.68. The bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively.Although the moving averages are sloping down, the RSI is attempting to rebound off the oversold territory. This suggests that aggressive bulls are attempting to start a relief rally.The first resistance on the upside is the 20-day EMA ($1). If the price turns down from this level and breaks below the support zone, the downtrend could resume and the MATIC/USDT pair may drop to $0.54 and then $0.34.Alternatively, if bulls propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($1.26). A break above this resistance could open the doors for an up-move to $1.71.The rebound off $0.78 is facing resistance at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. This suggests that bears are unwilling to let go of their advantage and are selling on rallies. The bears will now try to sink the pair to $0.74.Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will once again try to push the price above the 20-EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could rise to the 50-SMA. Above this resistance, the relief rally may reach $1.05.THETA has been in a downtrend since topping out at $15.88 on April 16. The down move has reached the strong support zone at $4.57 to $3.85, which could attract buying.The down sloping moving averages suggest that bears are in command but the oversold levels on the RSI indicate the possibility of a countertrend rally. The first resistance on the upside is the 20-day EMA ($5.68).If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the THETA/USDT pair below the support zone. A break below $3.85 will signal the start of the next leg of the downtrend that could reach $2.60.On the contrary, if bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to the downtrend line. A breakout of this resistance will suggest a possible trend change.The pair has been consolidating in a tight range between $4.33 to $4.62. The RSI has formed a positive divergence on the 4-hour chart, indicating that the bearish momentum may be weakening.If bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-EMA, the pair could rise to the 50-SMA. This level may act as a resistance but if buyers can overcome this hurdle, the pair could rise to the next overhead resistance at $6.Conversely, if bears sink and sustain the price below $4.33, the selling could intensify and the pair may drop to the psychological support at $4.Crypto.com Coin (CRO) has been range-bound between $0.14 and $0.08 for the past few days. The price turned down from $0.13 on July 14 but the positive sign is that the bulls are trying to stall the correction near the moving averages.Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. If the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $0.10, the pair could slide to the strong support at $0.08.Conversely, if bulls push and sustain the price above the moving averages, the CRO/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance zone at $0.13 to $0.14. The bears are likely to defend this zone aggressively. If the price turns down from this zone, the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.The bears pulled the price below the support at $0.108 but they could not build up on the advantage. The price recovered and rose to the 20-EMA but the bulls could not clear this hurdle. This suggests that bears have not given up and are selling on rallies.If bears sink and sustain the price below $0.108, the pair could start its journey toward the critical support at $0.08.On the contrary, if bulls drive the price above 20-EMA, the pair could rise to the 50-SMA. A break above this level will increase the possibility of a retest of the overhead resistance zone.Related: Here’s one way to trade Bitcoin even as BTC price teeters over an abyssUnus Sed Leo (LEO) has been trading near the resistance of the large range between $2.03 to $2.95 for the past few days. Usually, a tight consolidation near the overhead resistance indicates that bulls are not booking profits as they anticipate a breakout.Both moving averages have turned up and the RSI is above 63, indicating advantage to the buyers. If bulls sustain the price above $2.96, the LEO/USD pair could start its journey toward the next resistance at $3.32.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($2.78).Such a move will suggest that buyers have given up on the prospects of a breakout and are booking profits. That could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($2.59).The 4-hour chart shows the tight consolidation between $2.85 and $2.95 has resolved to the upside. If buyers sustain the price above $2.96, the bullish momentum could pick up and the pair may rise to $3.10 in the short term.The 20-EMA has started to turn up gradually and the RSI is above 62, indicating a minor advantage to the bulls. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and plummets below $2.80, the pair could slide to $2.67.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

152,"Bitcoin (BTC) was on track to lose nearly $3,000 this week as a weekend of mixed price behavior came to an end.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD trading at just above $31,500 late Sunday — a potential -$2,800 weekly candle.The weekend had produced little by way of surprises, with Bitcoin moving within a predictable range after seeing an initial brief spurt over $32,000 Friday.Despite retaining $31,000 support and so far not retesting $30,000, Bitcoin was nonetheless on track to seal its lowest weekly close since December 2020.#bitcoin still ranging sideways….

153,"Even before China finally wielded the ban hammer on crypto mining, Bitcoin (BTC) miners in North America had been building up their capacity amid efforts to gain a larger share of the global hash rate distribution. From building bigger data centers to acquiring hardware inventories, these establishments have been making concert efforts to balance the hash-power dichotomy between the Eastern and Western hemispheres.North American Bitcoin miners often have to contend with energy usage concerns as well and some have been keen to partner with oil and gas firms, becoming buyers of last resort for flared gas. Indeed, American oil drillers and Bitcoin mining firms continue to collaborate over natural gas utilization, proving once again that the potential for Bitcoin’s thermodynamic capacity is set to be a net positive for the environment, despite the criticisms put forward against proof-of-work (PoW) mining.With North American-based entities seemingly on the cusp of establishing a greater presence in the global Bitcoin mining matrix, here is a look at four of the largest Bitcoin miners in the region.In 2020, China still controlled about 65% of the global Bitcoin hash rate, according to estimates from several data sources. However, Riot Blockchain was expanding its operations with a swathe of major hardware acquisitions from leading Bitcoin miner makers like Bitmain.In August and December 2020 alone, Riot Blockchain spent millions of dollars to acquire thousands of Antminers from Bitmain. Indeed, as reported by Cointelegraph in April, Riot Blockchain’s hashing capacity increased by 460% in 2020.Riot Blockchain’s expanded inventory drive has continued into 2021, with the company purchasing over 42,000 Antminers from Bitmain earlier in the year. The Nasdaq-listed company also announced a $650 million purchase of a major data center located in Texas.By acquiring the Whinstone data center in Texas, Riot Blockchain is set to own the single largest Bitcoin mining facility in the United States. The American Bitcoin mining giant is even set to expand the original capacity of the site from 750 megawatts to over 1,000 MW.With its upscaled capacity coinciding with sweeping crackdowns in China, it is unsurprising to see Riot Blockchain enjoying greater Bitcoin mining success, as evidenced by the figures quoted in its monthly production and operations update. In April, the company reported that it mined 187 Bitcoin (worth $11.2 million at the time) the previous month.The March 2021 BTC production figure marked an 80% increase from its Bitcoin mining total for March 2020. In its latest report in June, the company stated it mined 243 BTC, a 406% increase from its June 2020 production figure.The June report also put Riot Blockchain’s year-to-date Bitcoin mining total at 1,167 BTC (currently worth $36.5 million). As of June 2020, the company had only mined 508 BTC meaning that this year’s production figure represents a 130% year-on-year increase.In total, Riot Blockchain says it holds over 2,200 BTC as of the end of June, with all of the Bitcoin coming from its mining operations. Detailing the link between its recent production successes and the situation in China, the June report stated, “The exodus of Bitcoin mining from China has resulted in a downward difficulty adjustment and lower global network hash rate. As such, Riot is currently mining more Bitcoin per day than at any time in the Company’s history,” continuing:Marathon is arguably Riot Blockchain’s main competitor in the “North American hash wars” and, like its rival, the crypto mining giant has been expanding its hardware inventory since 2020. In October, the Nevada-based Marathon Patent Group acquired 10,000 Antminer S-19 Pros from Bitmain.Such was the size of the order that it was estimated to boost the company’s operational hash rate capacity to 2.56 EH/s, a little more than the target 2.3 EH/s for Riot Blockchain’s expansion. With the Antminer order arriving in batches for Marathon, the company seems to now be focusing on achieving “carbon neutrality” and satisfying regulatory demands.Back in March, the company first announced plans to divert all of its current hash power to a regulatory-compliant Bitcoin mining pool by the start of May. At the time, Marathon stated that the new pool adhered to U.S. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols established by America’s Office of Foreign Control.As reported by Cointelegraph in May, Marathon is planning a 300 MW carbon-neutral data center that will house 73,000 Bitcoin miners. According to the announcement at the time, the deployment of the facility will bring the company’s carbon neutrality to about 70% while taking its hash rate to 10.37 EH/s.According to data from BTC.com, achieving a hash rate capacity of 10.37 EH/s would put Marathon number five on the current Bitcoin hash rate distribution log.While more than 50% down from its 2021 high of $56.56, the company’s stock is still up 122.34% year-to-date as of the time of writing. With Bitcoin exchange-traded funds yet to gain approval in the United States, Bitcoin mining stocks are seen as the next best thing in terms of gaining indirect exposure to BTC.Marathon itself is a Bitcoin holder separate from its mining interests. At the start of the year, the company bought over 4,800 BTC, valued at about $150 million at the time. New York Digital Investment Group reportedly facilitated the deal.United States.-based firms are not the only major players in the North American Bitcoin mining theater, as Canadian outfit Hut 8 is also a significant name in the conversation. Once the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner by capacity back in 2018, the Toronto-based company seems to be recovering from its previous setbacks.In 2018, the crypto market suffered a crippling bear market as coin prices tumbled from peaks reached in December 2017 and January 2018. In May 2019, Hut 8 reported losses north of $136 million for the previous year, which also culminated in significant staff cuts.Having waded through the crypto winter of 2018 and 2019, Hut 8 has undergone a massive upscaling of its miner hardware, announcing the purchase of over 11,000 MicroBT rigs valued at about $44 million. Based on the capacity of the MicroBT miners, Hut 8’s hash rate capacity is expected to reach 2.5 EH/s once all the machines are installed in the company’s 100 MW facility, currently under construction.At 2.5 EH/s, Hut 8 predicts its daily Bitcoin production will jump two-fold from between 6.5 to 7.5 BTCto between 14 to 16 BTC. Such a per diem BTC mining rate may also serve to preserve Hut 8’s status as the Bitcoin miner holding the most self-mined BTC in the world.Back in January, the Canadian Bitcoin miner estimated that its total Bitcoin holdings will reach 5,000 BTC by the start of 2022. The company also outlined plans to expand its hash rate to six EH/s by mid-2022.Related: North American crypto miners prepare to challenge China’s dominanceThe East-West shift in Bitcoin hash rate will ultimately involve sweeping changes to the energy mix for BTC mining, with more of an emphasis on “Green Bitcoin.” For the Canadian crypto miner, green energy is a major focus point for its operations.From Canada to Iceland, and even to Sweden, Hive Blockchain operated green-energy-powered data centers for crypto mining. Back in May, the company was reportedly forced to sell its facility in Norway, citing issues with regulators in the country.Earlier in July, Hive acquired 3,000 MicroBT M30S miners for its facility in New Brunswick, Canada. The added hash power will reportedly be contributed to the Foundry USA Pool that already aggregates hashing potential from other major North American miners like Hut 8, Blockcap and Bitfarms, among others.Hive’s additional 3,000 mining rigs will reportedly take the company’s hashing potential up by 0.264 EH/s to reach a total hash rate of 0.83 EH/s. The company also recently joined the ranks of publicly traded Bitcoin mining firms after securing a Nasdaq listing back in June.Meanwhile, Gryphon Digital Mining, another U.S.-based miner, may soon be challenging the more established names in the North American BTC mining industry. The company, which claims to run on 100% renewable energy, recently purchased 7,200 Antminer S19J Pro mining rigs.Based on the hashing capacity of the machines, Gryphon’s hash rate will approximately increase by about 0.72 EH/s. This new inventory will reportedly be installed in August and upon that time, the company will receive its ESG rating."
154,"It's now three months since the last Bitcoin (BTC) all-time high, but one measure suggests that holders may be waiting even longer for the next.In a series of tweets on July 17, analytics service Ecoinometrics revealed that this year's descent from all-time highs is the second-longest in Bitcoin bull market history.It's been 95 days since BTC/USD hit $64,500 and a major correction phase began. Investors are impatient, but despite strong fundamentals, Bitcoin spot price action seems in no hurry to leave $30,000 behind.At 55% below the highs, Bitcoin is also threatening to cause problems for price forecasting models, including the historically unparalleled stock-to-flow.If history is a guide, however, Bitcoin can still go sideways for months before rising to beat its record. As Ecoinometrics notes, 2013 saw a period of 197 days between two all-time highs.""This is one of the longest drawdown Bitcoin has had to deal with during a post-halving bull market,"" it acknowledged in Twitter comments.Back then, BTC/USD reached a price floor 69% below its previous all-time high, meaning that the current market setup could also permit levels below $30,000 and still remain within historical norms.More broadly, however, 2013 is now looking like the year most similar to Bitcoin price events this year.""In terms of price trajectory this correction also looks very similar to 2013,"" Ecoinometrics concluded.As Cointelegraph reported, recent on-chain behavior has painted $30,000 as more than just a psychological trading zone for Bitcoin.Related: Bitcoin price can only go up if $30K accumulation ‘reset’ continues — ResearchIn addition to multiple metrics supporting its importance, investors are beginning to accumulate coins once again, including those who previously sold at current levels.Over the weekend, statistician Willy Woo updated the picture, highlighting retail investors buying and different classes of whales balancing each other out between buys and sells.""It's retail that drive Bitcoin bull markets. When they stop buying, that's a bear market warning. They haven't stopped buying,"" he tweeted alongside multiple charts on Saturday."
155,"While Bitcoin (BTC) may be considered as a store of value for many, some consumers across the globe may be thinking otherwise. Recent data has revealed that 46 million people in the United States plan to use cryptocurrency to pay for things such as groceries or real estate. Payments giant Visa further revealed in July that its crypto-enabled cards processed over $1 billion in total spending during the first half of this year. As such, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that major brands like Starbucks, Home Depot and Target have started putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Yet, as crypto payments gain popularity and become easier to incorporate, smaller brands — specifically those geared toward women — are starting to accept crypto to help drive female adoption.For example, the billion-dollar beauty industry has taken a recent interest in Bitcoin. Ann McFerran, CEO and founder of Glamnetic — a magnetic eyelash beauty brand — told Cointelegraph that the company now accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) through a recent partnership with Bitcoin payment provider BitPay. According to McFerran, Glamentic is one of the very first female-founded beauty brands to support crypto payments.McFerran shared that she started investing in cryptocurrencies in 2017, yet noticed that the space was heavily male-dominated. To McFerran’s point, research firm BDC Consulting found that only 8% of all crypto users were women in 2019. After launching Glamentic in July 2019, McFerran was determined to incorporate crypto payments into the brand to encourage women to use cryptocurrency:McFerran further mentioned that she believes there is still a lot of stigma associated with how crypto is being used today. “It was certainly not a secure payment method to begin with,” she remarked. McFerran noted that events such as Silk Road and Mt. Gox have further resulted in women’s disinterest in crypto: “Even to this day, women are not fully educated when it comes to crypto. I want to educate others so they can understand the risks and what they are potentially missing out on.""Although transacting with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for beauty products may encourage women to become interested in cryptocurrencies, this is just one part of the equation. Sanja Kon, CEO of Utrust — a banking system for crypto payments — told Cointelegraph that educating women around crypto depends heavily on a brand’s ability to reach their consumer base with the correct educational tools:According to Kon, Utrust is facilitating this movement by investing resources into educational plans with the company’s merchants. McFerran also noted that Glamnetic has started creating TikTok videos to educate consumers on cryptocurrency, which can make a big impact given the notion that younger consumers are more likely to own crypto. PYMNTS.com found that 27% of all millennials either own or have owned one type of cryptocurrency.McFerran further remarked that Glamnetic will be releasing a magnetic eyelash collection inspired by Dogecoin to help drive adoption: “I think people will be more open to the idea of crypto if you turn that concept into an entire beauty product.”While Glamnetic may be one of the first female-founded beauty companies to accept crypto payments, a handful of larger cosmetic brands have also started incorporating crypto in other ways to drive female participation.Related: What can you buy with Bitcoin: Places to spend your crypto in 2021Aubrey Strobel, head of communications at Lolli — an online Bitcoin rewards platform — told Cointelegraph that the company works with leading retailers including Sephora, Ulta, EM Cosmetics and Glossier. According to Strobel, women make up 30% of Lolli’s user base. “Historically, women have lagged behind men in the space, but lead a vast majority of many households’ purchasing decisions,” Strobel said.Strobel explained that companies offering Bitcoin rewards to consumers are attractive to many shoppers, especially women who want to “stack sats” when making purchases online.This notion is highlighted in a recent report from The Defiant, titled “Global Report on Women, Cryptocurrency and Financial Independence.” In this document, a woman named Christine noted that she occasionally learns how to manage cryptocurrency by practicing with small transactions. She stated that she has been stacking sats to accumulate small amounts of Bitcoin over a long period of time. “When I travel, I like to buy coffee and other things with it,” Christine further remarked.While it’s too soon to tell if crypto payments for beauty products will drive female participation within crypto, a small impact is already being exhibited. McFerran shared that Glamnetic has already processed a handful of crypto transactions from women consumers. Yuvi Alpert, founder and CEO of Noémie — a jewelry company that also recently incorporated crypto payments — also told Cointelegraph that the brand has currently only seen crypto sales with their female customers.Although this may be the case, findings show that the top products females are likely to spend cryptocurrency on are travel and leisure, real estate and furniture or appliances. Yet, while crypto payments may be slow to catch on in the beauty industry, brands incorporating cryptocurrency transactions will likely gain a competitive advantage.According to Kon, more brands, in general, are starting to understand the advantage of accepting cryptocurrencies as a payment method:"
156,"If one word could be used to describe how the majority of participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem feel about the near-term outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) it would be 'undecided', as mixed signals from all manner of indicators have many traders waiting for a significant move in either direction before planning their next entry point. A new report from Delphi Digital took a macro look at Bitcoin's current price action and found that a variety of factors, including low exchange volumes and the strengthening U.S. dollar have weighed heavily on the top cryptocurrency.Bitcoin's recent dip to $31,000 adds to the aura of fear that currently envelops the crypto market and analysts are now warning that failure to close above $31,000 could see BTC drop to the $29,000 to $24,000 zone.Here are three areas of focus that Delphi Digital highlights as being the most impactful on the short-term price action for BitcoinAccording to Delphi Digital, declines in trading activity are one of the biggest factors affecting the market. This is because after the May 19 sell-off there was an exodus of spot and derivatives traders from exchanges.As seen in the chart above, after seeing a substantial increase during the first half of 2021, exchange volumes have fallen by more than 60% as prices collapsed and traders swore off using leverage.The precipitous drop in BTC price also helped to tamper down retail traders' use of high leverage in derivatives markets and proof of this comes from BTC futures open interest dropping back to levels seen since early 2021.Delphi Digital said:On a more positive note, the mega liquidation event seen back in May helped clear out overleveraged traders, meaning “stronger-handed participants are the ones primarily contributing to current open interest levels.”Another factor weighing on the price of Bitcoin has been the recent strength of the U.S. dollar, which has been on an uptrend since bottoming at 89.53 on May 25.As seen in the chart above, a large inverse head and shoulders pattern has formed on the DXY chart with the neckline now being tested for the third time.Should the dollar make another leg higher, the current economic recovery could be threatened as financial conditions would tighten and this might weigh heavily on many of the most popular trades of 2021.Delphi Digital said:While the 51% drop in BTC price has many analysts afraid that another multi-year bear market could be starting, it’s important to account for some of the larger macro trends that led to the current conditions.The above chart shows that Bitcoin had six consecutive months of price gains before a downturn and the asset was due for a pullback from a historical perspective.Even with BTC down 51% from its all-time high, on a year-over-year basis, its price is still 250% higher than its $9,100 valuation on July 16, 2020. The long-term uptrend for Bitcoin remains intact with its price currently testing the 12-month moving average, an important level of support that will determine where the price heads from here.Bitcoin trading volume on spot and derivative exchanges is down and the prospects of a strengthening dollar weigh heavily on global financial markets. This has resulted in indecisiveness being the primary emotion that rules the crypto market at the moment and this sentiment is likely to persist until a major price movement or motivating event prompts engagement from sidelined traders.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

158,"Bitcoin (BTC) bears should watch out for a potential blow as the number of margined short positions on the Bitfinex exchange crashes by roughly 25%.The dataset dropped to 11,066 BTC as of 12:20 GMT Saturday, compared to 14,897 BTC at the session's open. Meanwhile, the drop came as a part of a bigger downside move that started on July 15. On the day, the total number of margined short positions had reached 17,053 BTC.In simple terms, BTCUSDSHORTS represents the number of margined bearish positions on Bitfinex, measured in BTC. Traders borrow funds from Bitfinex — their broker — to bet on bearish outcomes for the instrument BTC/USD. That said, the latest data shows that traders have reduced their leveraged bearish exposure in the Bitcoin market.Popular trader Scott Melker claimed that each massive drop in the BTCUSDSHORTS positions on Bitfinex leads to a run-up in the spot Bitcoin prices, adding that he will be watching markest for a similar bullish reaction.Bitfinex whale may be starting to wind down those shorts. Each time they drop, price has risen. Will be watching. pic.twitter.com/5F40LYjMVLThrowing a closer look at the BTCUSD-BTCUSDSHORTS correlation showed an erratic positive correlation. The Bitfinex short positions went for a Bear Run after December 2020, a period that coincided with a spike across Bitcoin spot and derivatives markets.In April-May, a run-down in Bitfinex short positions coincided with the Bitcoin price surging from sub-$45,000 to a record high of $65,000. Nonetheless, similar BTCUSDSHORTS crashes in June—at best—kept Bitcoin stabilized above a psychological support level of $30,000, if not pumped it outright.Downside pressure on Bitcoin sustains despite a recent drop in BTCUSDShorts also as Grayscale Investments unlock 16,000 BTC worth of its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares on July 18, after a six-month lock-up period.JPMorgan & Chase strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou warned in June that Grayscale's massive unlocking event could become the source of the next selling wave in the Bitcoin market.On-chain analyst Willy Woo echoed similar concerns last week, explaining that when GBTC premium drops relative to the Bitcoin units held in Grayscale's reserves, it tends to divert investors from spot markets.""Investors now have more incentive to by GBTC shares rather than BTC, it diverts some of the buying pressure on BTC spot markets,"" said Woo. ""This is bearish.""(1) is sudden and directly impactful than while (2) acts very slowly. Thus it's a bullish.

The over all impact over the long term is neutral as it's all arbitrage which balances out in time. What we are analysing is the short term demand/supply imbalances which may impact price.As an optimistic BTCUSDSHORTS drop offsets a pessimistic GBTC unlock event, the spot BTC/USD exchange rate holds $31,000 as its interim support.BTC/USD has repeatedly tested the $30,000-$31,000 range as support before rebounding higher. A maximum of its retracement has been able to pierce through the $35,000-resistance level. Nonetheless, profit-taking sentiment pushed the pair back toward $30,000.As a result, the bearish sentiment for Bitcoin among analysts is extremely high, below $30,000. For instance, pseudonymous chartist Fomocap sees BTC/USD crashing to $20,000 if the pair closes below $30,000.Weekly. Price get rejected from 39k. Then 35k. Cont to squeeze down with higher pressure.

159,"It has now been three months since Bitcoin’s price peaked at an all-time high just shy of $65,000. For most of the last two months, Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in the $30,000–$40,000 range, as much as 54% lower than its peakThe downturn came at a time when many analysts were predicting exactly the opposite — a bull cycle set to run to new record highs within months — with some even speculating that a six-figure BTC price would materialize this year.So, what’s going on? Is the current market downturn just a blip on an otherwise upward trajectory, or is the crypto market back in the kind of long-term bearish territory last seen in 2018?Bitcoin’s historical price activity has a compelling correlation with its halving cycles, with previous all-time highs being reached within around 12 to 18 months of a halving. PlanB, the creator of the Stock-to-Flow BTC price model, is among the most vocal proponents of this. On Twitter, the analyst remains resolute that the Stock-to-Flow Cross Asset Model (S2FX) predicts further bullish action, pointing to similar temporary downturns before epic rallies in previous cycles.So far, the S2FX model has been one of the most accurate price predictors of Bitcoin over the years. In addition, on-chain metrics appear to support the theory that bearish sentiments could be short-lived. For instance, shortly after Bitcoin’s April price peak, traders suddenly started moving funds onto exchanges, ending an almost uninterrupted eight-month run of HODLing.Igneus Terrenus, head of communications at crypto exchange Bybit, believes that short-term traders were responsible for the sell-off following BTC’s price highs. He told Cointelegraph:“A series of deleveraging events shook off many short-term speculators, whose capitulation accounts for the majority of realized losses in recent months. While the euphoria at the start of the year has all but dissipated, whales and long-term holders have remained confident through the market's overall bearish sentiments.”However, over the recent weeks, trading platforms have once again seen funds flowing out. Glassnode’s Realized HODL Ratio, which tracks the willingness of investors to let go of their holdings, also appears to reflect similar patterns seen in previous cycles.Richard Nie, chief research analyst at Bingbon, believes that the exchange flows are telling. Speaking to Cointelegraph, he concurred that the metrics indicate a bullish shift. “We ought to pay attention to the number of whale holders and the amount of BTC held by exchanges,” he said, adding that as “more BTC is withdrawn from exchanges and moved into private addresses, this is a strong bullish signal.”Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, told Cointelegraph: “Right now crypto volumes across exchanges are the lowest they’ve been all year. Once trading picks up again, that would be a good indication the lull is complete.”Project funding is another significant indicator of market sentiment, and 2021 has been an outstanding year for crypto startups. As reported by Cointelegraph, the crypto industry saw more funding in the first quarter of 2021 than in all of 2020 put together, pulling in $2.6 billion.The downturn since April doesn’t appear to have spoiled the appetites of venture capitalists at all. In late May, stablecoin issuer Circle raised $440 million, and only days later, Mike Novogratz’s Cryptology Asset Group announced it was launching a crypto investment fund worth $100 million.By mid-June, Bloomberg had reported that the total venture capital investment in crypto for the year was already up to over $17 billion. Even discounting the $10 billion that Block.one directed into its new exchange venture, it’s sufficient to demonstrate that the crypto market’s second-quarter performance hasn’t yet affected the growth in venture capital investment.There are also macro market factors to consider. Amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding the state of the global economy, some, including Robert Kiyosaki — author of Rich Dad Poor Dad — have predicted a stock market crash. In Kiyosaki’s case, he’s also been encouraging his followers to stock up on gold and Bitcoin. There are signs that Bitcoin may be becoming more correlated to stocks, but could a mass stock sell-off mean investors ultimately turn to BTC as a safe-haven asset?A further consideration is Bitcoin's upcoming Taproot upgrade due to activate in November. It marks the first upgrade to the Bitcoin network since the Segregated Witness (SegWit) fork, which took place in August 2017. Of course, that was followed by an epic run up to a new all-time high of $20,000 in December 2017. It’s hard to know if history could repeat itself in this regard or if there’s even any direct correlation between the upgrades and the markets, but it’s worth bearing in mind.It’s beyond doubt that the biggest bearish forces shaping the markets over the last few months have been regulatory. Most notably, the Chinese government’s mining clampdown has created widespread uncertainty. Many large mining operations have been forced offline — in some cases permanently and in others temporarily as they relocated from China to new sites. This migration no doubt came at a significant expense, and in the meantime, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has undergone its biggest drop in history, only confirming the impact that the clampdown has had on the network.However, lawmakers from other countries have also recently started to take a closer look at crypto. India, which only relaxed its stance toward cryptocurrencies in 2020, could once again be considering a ban, although the situation continues to evolve.The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority also recently launched a campaign against Binance, ordering it to stop undertaking regulated activity in the country. Now, crypto firms are withdrawing licensing applications in the U.K., while users are finding themselves locked out of the exchange by their banks.In general, Binance has been under regulatory pressure from all over the world, for a variety of reasons. In the meantime, it’s still not clear if regulators are going after Binance specifically or if the exchange is simply seen as a representative of the rest of the crypto industry.Related: Binance in the crosshairs: Are regulators paying attention to crypto?Institutional analysts have also been making ominous predictions about Bitcoin’s price, with JPMorgan issuing a warning that the near-term setup for BTC continues to look unstable. While these developments aren’t likely to be as seismic as the Chinese mining ban, they haven’t helped market confidence.Daniele Bernardi, CEO of fintech management company Diaman Group, believes that there are reasons to be cautious, telling Cointelegraph:“If we analyze the Bitcoin price based on the S2F model, Bitcoin prices have the potential to triple in the short term. However, at Diaman, we’ve also developed a model based on the rate of adoption. Following this model, a $64k ATH is fair.”As it has previously been suggested that most of the signals point to this bull market only being at a halfway point, is there enough evidence to reverse that direction? All things considered — and unsurprisingly — it’s too soon to say definitively. On one side, there is regulatory tumult and a substantial decrease in trading volume, suggesting an overall lack of interest and engagement. On the other, there are some telling on-chain metrics and indicators of investor sentiment that appear to stack up in favor of a continuing bull market.Related: GBTC unlock edges closer as impact on Bitcoin price remains unclearHowever, in practice, the regulatory issues continue to spook the market, proving that price models and VC funding aren’t necessarily able to assuage concerns. If there are further major clampdowns, then it may be that the bull market cannot recover after all.The fact that prices have held above $30,000 thus far, despite perhaps the biggest test to mining security in history, is a testament to the bullish forces at play. If the current regulatory situation starts to calm, then there’s every chance that the bullish part of the market cycle could still play out to its predicted conclusion."

Traders also often use price charts, gauging price patterns and price indicators. Charting price action is called technical analysis. Additionally, since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies show asset movement publicly on their blockchains, analysts can come up with their own conclusions based on transactions and activity — known as on-chain analysis.For more on crypto trading, read: How to trade cryptocurrencies: The ultimate beginner's guideTrading can also overlap with the developer’s niche, as traders may want to build (or have someone else build) trading bots, customer chart indicators and other useful trading tools.How does crypto fit into countries’ existing laws and regulations? Should regions craft new laws and guidelines for crypto and blockchain? Regulation has been a growing area of focus as the crypto industry continues to develop for years to come.Cryptocurrency classifications as assets have come along slowly. Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) are generally viewed as commodities, but the classification for the many other crypto assets in the industry has been less than clear.The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took action against Ripple in 2020 regarding the status of XRP, an asset Ripple has been involved with in various capacities over the years. Other regulatory action also exists in crypto and blockchain, such as the ongoing scene with crypto exchanges and their regions of operation.Crypto or blockchain-interested folks in the mainstream legal or regulatory field might find an overlap of their passions by diving into crypto regulation in some capacity. This might include working on crypto projects’ legal and compliance teams, working with policy groups and think tanks, or serving directly within governments to elicit change.Leaders and visionaries may have the desire to improve the crypto space by creating a project or business that solves an identified problem or need. Innovators have birthed countless projects in the space over the years, helping to grow the industry from a single asset into an entire sector.Building a company might involve identifying something that is missing in crypto or blockchain space, then subsequently hiring and leading a team focused on providing a particular solution to that problem.For more about crypto regulation, read: Will regulation adapt to crypto, or crypto to regulation? Experts answerOverlap in this category exists, as company builders may also have expertise in coding, regulation, or another of the aforementioned fields.Social media and internet growth have opened the door for participants to share their thoughts and expertise globally. Virtually anyone can learn vast amounts of information about the crypto space through YouTube, Twitter and other methods, and then add their own expertise to the equation by providing their own content.Related: A new era of content monetization? Blockchain tech can get you paidContent streams can include writing about crypto and blockchain on a personal blog or for a media company, making YouTube content, Medium posts, and more. Content creation can overlap with all of the other categories mentioned in this article as well. Developers, traders and regulatory professionals can all create their own content."
161,"A common saying in the investing world is “The trend is your friend,” a phrase that points to the idea that the majority of the time, sticking with the prevailing market trend will produce positive results.Some of the common metrics used to identify market trends include: technical analysis, which involves studying price charts to spot opportunities; fundamental analysis, which involves looking at a project’s underlying economic and technological factors; and social media metrics, which help an investor listen to the pulse of what the wider public is focused on.One of the more popular metrics that crypto traders use to identify emerging patterns is Google Trends, a product that analyzes the popularity of search queries performed via Google’s search engine. Using Google Trends, users can view the data in simple line graphs that also provide a breakdown by geographical region.The Google Trends chart for “Bitcoin” shows several sharp spikes in searches over the past year, most notably in early January, late February, mid-April and again in mid-May.A look at the BTC price chart shows that each of the spikes in Google searches coincided with run-ups in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and indicates that search queries do indeed offer some insight into identifying trends that could impact prices.The same approach can also be applied to altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens. Let’s take a look at how social analysis preceded the rise of popular NFT-related tokens and DeFi blue chips like Polygon’s MATIC.DeFi was the hottest sector in the cryptocurrency market at the beginning of 2021, and it seemed like not a day passed without some newly emerged lending or farming protocol reaching $1 billion in total value locked.Data from CoinGecko shows that the total market capitalization of the top 100 DeFi tokens began to rapidly increase in mid-January, and eventually, the figure peaked in mid-May after the entire cryptocurrency market proceeded to sell off.Searching “DeFi” in Google Trends produces the following chart, which actually shows a spike in the number of queries around the same time as the market cap of DeFi tokens began to increase.This figure continued to increase even after the number of queries declined during the month of March.Spikes seen in the number of searches in April and again in May also occurred around the same time as spikes in the DeFi market cap.The rise of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, in February and March caught the world’s attention as big-name celebrities like NFL veteran Rob Gronkowski and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey got in on the action and established auction houses like Sotheby’s helped facilitate NFT auctions, including the recent sale of CryptoPunk #7523, which was sold for a record $11.8 million.Some of the biggest monthly gains from NFT projects include a 443% gain in the price of THETA between March 1 and 21, and a 530% gain in the price of Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) from Feb. 23 to March 15. Chiliz (CHZ) saw a 3,690% surge in price between Feb. 13 and March 13.The increase in prices coincided with a surge in NFT-related searches registered by Google Trends.While it was widely reported that NFTs stole DeFi’s thunder, evidence of the rotation can be seen when the DeFi and NFT search interest charts are combined. As shown below, there is a sudden and massive rise in NFT queries as searches for DeFi fall.The magnitude of NFT search queries was also significantly higher than that of DeFi, hinting that nonfungible tokens may be an optimal route to encouraging the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.Looking at the late February to early March timeframe on the price charts, a dip in the price of DeFi tokens is seen at roughly the same time as the prices of NFT tokens start to rise, indicating some level of rotation out of DeFi and into NFTs.Both charts show spikes in search interest that line up with price increases in related DeFi and NFT tokens, and they also manage to capture the diminishing interest seen as prices fell in June and July.Related: Striking a chord: DeFi’s domino effect on NFTs and Web 3.0 adoptionTwitter is also a good source to obtain insight into what coins retail investors might be interested in, and analyzing the number of Twitter mentions can help hone in on which projects have the potential to see future price movements.In 2021, Polygon emerged as one of the most promising layer-two solutions for the Ethereum network, and social media mentions increased significantly as the price of its native MATIC token surged 700% from $0.33 on April 26 to its all-time high of $2.68 on May 18.As seen in the chart above, data from TheTIE shows that most of the large jumps in the price of MATIC coincided with spikes in tweet volume where the keyword “MATIC” was mentioned.Google Trends also shows an increase in searches for “Polygon” during this time period, with the initial spike in interest coming during the week of April 25 to May 1.While many analysts and trend watchers prefer to utilize technical and fundamental analyses to keep a pulse on developing trends, it’s important to remember that no cryptocurrency project has any value without the people involved in the network.This means that valuable insights can always be found in analyzing information and announcements that catch people’s attention and initiate public engagement.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

162,"Bitcoin (BTC) is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near $31,000, which makes it an important level to watch out for. Data from Glassnode shows that the $31,000 to $34,300 zone has seen strong interest from buyers and sellers as 9.93% of the Bitcoin supply has moved in this zone.The failure of Bitcoin to rally quickly from strong support levels indicates weak demand. Proof of the current disinterest comes from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who said in a recent CNBC interview that investor demand for cryptocurrencies had declined recently. Fink said that during his last two weeks of business travel, not one question about Bitcoin and crypto investing was presented to him.Another sign of reduced demand is that the 90-day inflow into the United States and Canada-based Bitcoin funds has plunged 93.49% from 191,846 BTC in January to 12,485 BTC, according to data collected by ByteTree Asset Management.In an interview with CNBC on July 14, DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said that Bitcoin could drop under $23,000 due to the head-and-shoulders trading pattern, which “looks pretty convincing.”Will Bitcoin break below the support and start the next leg down or is it due for a rebound? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the critical levels to watch out for.Bitcoin has been trading near the $31,000 support for the past two days. The failure to rebound sharply off this critical support is a weak sign as it suggests a lack of strong demand at these levels.The downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory indicate that bears have the upper hand. A break and close below $31,000 could open the doors for a drop to the next support at $28,000.If the price rebounds off the $31,000 to $28,000 zone with strength, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The bulls will then try to push the price above the moving averages. A breakout and close above the 50-day simple moving average ($35,084) will be the first sign of a possible change in trend.Conversely, if the price slips below $28,000, the bearish momentum could pick up and the BTC/USDT pair could slump to $20,000.Ether’s (ETH) relief rally on July 14 could not rise above the 20-day exponential moving average ($2,097). This suggests that sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on every minor rally. The biggest altcoin could now drop to the critical support at $1,728.74.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is below 41, indicating that bears are in control. If bears sink the price below $1,728.74, the ETH/USDT pair will complete a descending triangle pattern.That could signal the resumption of the downtrend with the next support at $1,536.92 and then $1,293.18.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the $1,728.74 support, the bulls will make one more attempt to clear the moving averages. If they succeed, the pair could rally to the downtrend line.Binance Coin (BNB) has been trading near the 20-day EMA ($313) for the past few days. Although the price dipped below the 20-day EMA on July 14, the long tail on the day’s candlestick showed buying at lower levels.The buyers attempted to push the price above the 50-day SMA ($329) on July 15 but failed. This shows the bears have not yet given up and are aggressively defending the 50-day SMA. The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand.A breakout and close above the 50-day SMA will be the first sign of strength. The bulls will then try to push the price to $379.58 and later to $400. On the contrary, a break below the $276.40 to $264.26 support zone will signal advantage to the bears. That could pull the price down to $211.70.Cardano’s (ADA) rebound off $1.19 on July 14 could not climb back above $1.28, suggesting that bears are defending this level aggressively. The price turned down from $1.28 on July 15 and plunged below $1.19 today.The long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that bulls are again attempting to stall the decline and start a relief rally. A breakout and close above the 20-day EMA ($1.32) will be the first sign of strength. The pair could then rise to the 50-day SMA ($1.44).On the other hand, if bears sustain the price below $1.19, the ADA/USDT pair could continue its decline to $1.10. A break below this support may retest the critical support at $1. This level has held on several occasions since Feb. 26, hence the bulls will again try to defend it.A strong rebound off $1 will indicate accumulation at lower levels but the bulls are likely to face stiff resistance at $1.19. If the price turns down from this level, the possibility of a break below $1 increases. If that happens, the pair could start a new downtrend with the next support at $0.80.The bulls are attempting to defend the $0.59 support for the past two days but have not been able to achieve a strong rebound off it. This suggests a lack of urgency among traders to buy XRP at the current levels.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 39 suggest that bears have the upper hand. A break and close below $0.59 could pull the price down to the critical support at $0.50.If the price rebounds off $0.50 with strength, the bulls will again try to push the XRP/USDT pair above the 20-day EMA ($0.65). If they succeed, the pair could rise to $0.75.On the other hand, if bears sink the price below $0.50, the pair could drop to the next support at $0.45 and later to $0.40.Dogecoin (DOGE) has continued to drift lower toward the critical support at $0.15. This level had held on two previous occasions, hence the bulls will again try to defend it aggressively.If the price rebounds off $0.15, the bulls will try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.22). If they can pull it off, it will suggest the start of a relief rally that may reach the 50-day SMA ($0.27).Conversely, if bears sink the price below $0.15, the selling could intensify as traders rush to the exit. That could result in a fall to $0.10 and later to $0.07. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI near the oversold zone suggest that the possibility of a breakdown is higher.The failure of the bulls to drive Polkadot (DOT) back above $14.50 in the past two days indicates a lack of demand at higher levels. That resulted in further selling today, sinking the altcoin below the critical support at $13.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is near the oversold territory, suggesting that bears are in command. If the price sustains below $13, the DOT/USDT pair could decline to the next support at $10.The bulls may try to arrest the decline at the psychological level at $10 but any relief rally is likely to face resistance at $13. If the bears flip this level into resistance, the possibility of a drop to $7 increases. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA ($15.38).Uniswap’s (UNI) attempt to rebound off the $16.93 support on July 14 did not find buyers at higher levels. The altcoin turned down on July 15 and broke below $16.93 today but the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests buying at lower levels.If the price sustains above $16.93, the bulls will again try to push the price to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will suggest a possible change in trend.Conversely, if the price sustains below $16.93, the UNI/USDT pair could drop to $15 and later to the critical support at $13. Both moving averages have turned down and the RSI has dipped below 40, indicating that bears have the upper hand.If the price plummets below $13, the pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern. This could resume the downtrend with the next support at $10 and then $7.Related: Bitcoin price passes $32K with traders wary of 'relief rally' if resistance staysThe bulls tried to push Bitcoin Cash (BCH) back above $475.69 on July 14 but failed. This suggests that bears have flipped the $475.69 level to resistance. The altcoin turned down and resumed its down move on July 15.There is a minor support at $428. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to push the BCH/USDT pair above $475.69. If they succeed, the pair may rise to $538.11. A breakout of this resistance will indicate a possible change in trend.Alternatively, if the price continues its down move and breaks below $428, the pair could drop to the psychological level at $400 and then $370. The declining moving averages and the RSI below 36 suggest that bears are in control. A break below $370 could start the next leg of the downtrend.Litecoin’s (LTC) rebound off the $118 support on July 14 fizzled out at the downtrend line on July 15. This suggests that bears are defending the downtrend line aggressively.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 36 suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside. If bears sink and sustain the price below $118, the LTC/USDT pair could drop to the $104.92 to $100 support zone.This zone may attract buyers but if bulls fail to propel the price back above $118, the selling might continue. A break below $100 could extend the decline to the next support at $70. This negative view will invalidate if the price rebounds off the current level and breaks above the downtrend line.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

163,"U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen announced plans to convene the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, or PWG, as well as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to discuss possible interagency work with regard to stablecoins.

The Securities Clarity Act would apply equally to all assets, tangible or digital, and states an investment contract asset is separate and distinct from the offering it may have been a part of."
164,"Dollar traders have kept a close eye on a potentially bullish ""inverse head-and-shoulders"" pattern building in the U.S. dollar index (DXY) chart. Meanwhile, the smell of a stronger greenback is weakening Bitcoin's (BTC) upside case, especially as the flagship cryptocurrency struggles to break out of its current $30,000-35,000 trading range.In detail, the inverse head-and-shoulders (IH&S) pattern forms after a downtrend. It contains three successive troughs, with the middle trough (head) being the deepest than the other two (shoulders). Ideally, the two shoulders are of equal height and width. All three troughs hang by a price ceiling known as a neckline that serves as resistance.DXY, which measures the dollar's strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, currently checks all the boxes to prove that it has formed an IH&S pattern.The index now stares at the prospect of undergoing a bullish breakout upon closing above its neckline resistance. In doing so, it would set up a technical profit target at a distance equal to the price gap between the neckline to the bottom of the head.The bullish setup expects DXY to rise by almost 5% on a potential neckline breakout move.Meanwhile, the index's 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the blue wave) also anticipates to cross above its 200-day simple moving average (20-day SMA; the saffron wave) to confirm a Golden Cross. Traders consider golden crosses as bullish indicators.A weaker dollar environment after March 2020 served as a tailwind for risk assets and global growth, propelled by the U.S. Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policies to cushion the economic aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. DXY closed 2020 at a 6.83% loss.But entering 2021, the dollar showed signs of trend reversals as the U.S. economy rebounded strongly amid a speedy coronavirus vaccination program. As markets reopened, demand for the dollar and dollar-based investments rose among global investors.Brent Johnson, chief executive of Santiago Capital, called the dollar ""Giffen Good,"" a type of asset whose demand increases with its prices. He noted that despite rising inflation caused by Fed's money printing, global investors had increased their dollar debts, adding:Kevin Kelly, the chief financial analyst at Delphi Digital, said that net speculative futures positioning on DXY is not as bearish it was at the beginning of 2021. He added that the setup is very similar to DXY's positioning in early 2018 that followed by a roughly 10% price rally in the next 18 months.A recent run-up in the DXY market came alongside three back-to-back monthly spikes in inflation. Per the latest Labor Department released this Tuesday, the U.S. consumer price index rose to 5.4% year-over-year, the highest 12-month rate since August 2008. James Freeman, the assistant editor at the Wall Street Journal, blamed the Fed's money printing policies for the ongoing inflationary pressure, noting that the dollars in each wallet have been actively losing their value as a result. Nonetheless, the Fed has assured that inflation was a temporary problem, providing a bullish backstop to the DXY rally.In his congressional testimony on Wednesday, Fed chairman Jerome Powell admitted that the economic conditions at present do not allow them to taper bank their quantitative easing programs, including a $120bn a month bond-buying program. However, Powell added that the Fed would alert markets in advance if they ever decided to scale back its purchasing.Combined with lower rates, the Fed's expansionary policies have spurred cheaper lending, thus creating more demand for assets, including homes, tech stocks, gold, and even Bitcoin. But, at the same time, fears that a consistently rising inflation would prompt the central bank to cut rates have also pressured seemingly overvalued assets to lose a portion of their yearlong gains.For example, Bitcoin, often propagated as a hedge against higher inflation, dropped by more than 50% from its record high of about $65,000. Its plunge largely appeared in the wake of regulatory crackdowns around the world, a Chinese mining exodus, among other factors. But the Federal Open Market Committee's decision mid-June to cut interest rates in 2023 may have also added to its downside momentum.""If the US dollar reverses trend, it threatens to throw cold water on some of this year’s most popular trades,"" noted Kelly.Nevertheless, some analysts see a rising dollar as no threat to Bitcoin, believing that investors would keep allocating a portion of their portfolio to the emerging global asset.ARK Invest Founder and CEO Cathie Wood, for example, told CNBC Bitcoin could end up on a more solid footing after overcoming worries related to the recent China crypto mining ban and its alarming carbon footprints, an issue raised by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in May.An Intertrust survey of hedge fund chief financial officers worldwide also found that they would increase their crypto exposure significantly by 2026. 17% of respondents expected to allocate more than 10% in Bitcoin and similar digital assets.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

165,"Bitcoin (BTC) passed $32,000 later on July 16 as positive reactions over Bank of America's (BoA) Bitcoin futures go-ahead continued.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD rising 1.4% on the day to hit new local highs of $32,150 on Bitstamp.The pair saw an abrupt reversal of trajectory on the BoA announcement, having previously tested $31,000 support repeatedly throughout the day.As such, a key zone to retake for potential bullish continuation, $32,300, was now back on the menu, this seeming an unlikely goal just hours before.For trader and analyst Rekt Capital, current levels are key when it comes to the daily close.""BTC needs to reclaim orange as support if BTC is to maintain the upper half of this blue wedging structure,"" he said alongside an explanatory chart.As Cointelegraph reported, on the lower end, $31,000 remained as a crucial breaker whose failure to hold would open the door to $24,000.Bitcoin's latest move had an instantaneous knock-on effect for altcoins.Whereas daily losses across major cryptocurrencies were typically 5% on Friday, these swiftly dissipated and some altcoins even began posting gains.Largest altcoin Ether (ETH) traded at $1,923 at the time of writing, launching towards the $2,000 level away from a support zone nearer $1,800.

166,"A major cryptocurrency and blockchain association in Russia is launching a project to bring global crypto mining operations to the country amid a Chinese crypto mining crackdown.The Russian Association of Cryptoeconomics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, or RACIB, announced an initiative aimed at transferring global computing resources for crypto mining to the Russian Federation. More information on the project is expected to be released at a later date, a spokesperson for RACIB told Cointelegraph.In order to promote and implement the project, RACIB is closely cooperating with Russian government authorities and state corporations, forming a range of joint working groups with local state structures, the announcement notes.One such group is focused on an “eco-mining” project for building mining farms and data centers powered by renewable electricity sources. In addition to Russia’s rich hydro- and nuclear-based energy, the group is seeking to establish crypto mining operations based on green energy sources like wind-based power plants.As part of the project, RACIB is already collaborating with some foreign partners including a consortium of some of the largest crypto mining-related companies in China. The announcement notes that companies in the consortium control “more than 25% of the global hashrate of the main cryptocurrencies.”According to energy-focused publication NS Energy, Russia is the fourth-largest country in terms of electricity production, generating over 1,100 terawatt-hours of energy per year, following China, the United States, and India. According to the announcement, over the couse of 2021 Russia has set up over 1,100 megawatts of new power plants using wind farms in areas like the Rostov region, the Republic of Kalmykia, Adygea, and Stavropol Krai.Related: The9 signs green Bitcoin mining deal with Russian firm BitRiverThe new initiative brings another strategic opportunity for global crypto miners amid Chinese mining firms fleeing the country as local authorities have been continuously cracking down on crypto mining activity and halting key mining farms . According to data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, China’s Bitcoin hash rate already plummeted before the crackdown, dropping to 46% in April 2021 from 75.5% in September 2019. In the same period, the U.S. hash rate share surged to nearly 17% from 4%, while Russia and Kazakhstan’s hash rate rose to about 8%.Russia is not the only country that is offering Chinese miners its energy capacity to emerge as a major player in the industry. Miami mayor Francis Suarez in June publicly invited Chinese crypto mining companies to consider establishing data centers in the city amid miner capitulation in China."
167,"Bitcoin (BTC) continued to bounce off $31,000 support during Friday as fresh data reinforced the importance of current price levels.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD repeatedly testing but, so far, not breaking through $31,000 on Friday.A late surge to near $32,000 then entered as unconfirmed reports surfaced that Bank of America had given the go-ahead for Bitcoin futures trading.Market participants held mixed opinions about the short-term outlook, with popular trader Michaël van de Poppe noting on Thursday that $31,000 was something of a final frontier for Bitcoin — lose it, and $29,000 or even $24,000 would logically be next.Fellow trader Crypto Ed also appeared undecided on the day. Earlier in the week, he had argued that Bitcoin could stage a shock rebound and hit its range highs of $42,000 before reversing downward yet again to challenge $30,000 support.“BTC making new lows is invalidating the idea of continuation of that bounce,” he wrote in an update. Even a comedown for the United States dollar currency index (DXY), traditionally inversely correlated with BTC, is unlikely to help bulls significantly, he added.Update on this ⬆️
BTC making new lows is invalidating the idea of continuation of that bounce.
I still think DXY should see a pull back but it's doubtfull that such will move BTC to 42k.
Maybe there's no hidden play in the charts and BTC is just terribly weak and I was crazy pic.twitter.com/3nr65V9y4ZMeanwhile, new data showed considerable on-chain activity having occurred at current price levels.According to on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, 9.93% of the Bitcoin supply moved between $31,000 and $34,300 — a clear zone of interest for both buyers and sellers.“This is now convincingly the largest realised volume cluster since $12k,” the firm commented. Previously, Cointelegraph noted that $30,000 itself forms an important level in the minds of both small and large traders, whose behavior has flipped from a “sell” to a “buy” mentality in recent weeks.A look at altcoins, meanwhile, underscored the lack of bullish sentiment across cryptocurrency markets as the week came to a close.Most of the top 50 tokens by market capitalization saw heavier losses than BTC/USD, these reaching up to 12% amid an absence of price triggers.Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin, was heading to a crucial support zone of its own around $1,800. The start of a new accumulation period was now “very likely,” van de Poppe said in a YouTube update on Thursday prior to volatility reentering.Bitcoin’s rising dominance, hitting 46% on the day, added to altcoins’ woes."
168,"Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, took to Twitter to respond to a recent attack on crypto by Dogecoin (DOGE) co-creator Jackson Palmer.In a Twitter thread on Thursday, Armstrong pointed out some of the biggest benefits of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), stressing that crypto is “simply providing an alternative for people who want more freedom.”The CEO emphasized that one’s stance on the crypto industry depends on a perspective, elaborating that people who want more control from financial regulators are free to enjoy the traditional fiat system. But crypto is a “much-needed breath of fresh air” for those who believe that government solutions are often “inefficient, overpromise or underdeliver,” Armstrong noted.Armstrong went on to say that traditional investment tools are usually associated with a lack of opportunities for smaller investors, referring to restrictions such as accredited investor laws:In contrast to some traditional investment instruments, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin did not require investors to be accredited by any financial authority in early inception, thus representing an attractive opportunity for retail investors, Armstrong said:As such, Armstrong concluded that crypto creates “wealth mobility and more equality of opportunity for everyone,” stressing that everyone can choose the system that works best for them. “Crypto is not going to solve wealth inequality — it’s not trying to create the same outcome for everyone,” he added. With a mission to “create an open financial system for the world,” Coinbase is known for its “no-politics” stance officially taken in late 2020.Related: Michael Saylor doesn’t think Bitcoin is ‘going to be currency in the US ever’Palmer, who created Dogecoin as a joke back in 2013, took to Twitter earlier this week to blast the entire crypto industry, arguing that crypto is an “inherently right-wing, hyper-capitalistic technology” designed for a combination of “tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificially enforced scarcity.” In 2018, Palmer predicted that the industry is “rapidly racing towards an oversaturation of cryptocurrencies” to the point that their value and utility “inversely approaches zero.”As previously reported, Dogecoin has emerged as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies this year, becoming the top-gaining digital asset in Q2 2021 with a surge of 392%."
169,"United States’ city of Jackson, Tennessee, continues exploring a potential dive into cryptocurrencies, now looking to accept Bitcoin (BTC) for property tax payments.Jackson Mayor Scott Conger announced late Thursday that the city’s blockchain task force had launched a study on potential methods to accept property tax payments in Bitcoin in the city.The blockchain group will also explore how to allow employees to dollar-cost average Bitcoin, or purchase smaller amounts of Bitcoin over regular time intervals. Dollar-cost averaging Bitcoin purchases are considered to be the best strategy for accumulating Bitcoin, multiple studies confirmed.Conger earlier took to Twitter to blast the ongoing inflation and the U.S. dollar devaluation, arguing that Bitcoin is the “only one fix for this.”Why do we accept inflation? Why don’t we demand more from our federal government?

The city has been actively exploring options to pay city employees in cryptocurrency, adopting Bitcoin mining operations and adding BTC on the city’s balance sheet. Conger previously hinted that the city could be also looking to enable payments in several other digital coins like Ether (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC).Related: Crypto community divided on whether Bitcoin is an inflation hedgeAs previously reported, Mayor Conger followed in the steps of Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who has been pushing the city of Miami to adopt tax and salary payments in Bitcoin. Conger is also known for adopting “laser eyes,” a part of the crypto community’s flash mob supporting Bitcoin’s potential price surge up to $100,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $31,732, down 2.5% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko."
170,"The Crazy Horse 3 gentlemen's club has announced it has become the first major entertainment venue in Las Vegas to accept Bitcoin using the Lightning Network.The nightspot will implement the layer two Bitcoin scaling solution enabling punters to make payments in a flash. It has integrated BTC payment processor OpenNode which will initially allow guests to securely purchase VIP bottle packages using BTC through the venue’s website.According to the announcement, the Bitcoin payments rollout includes plans to accept the digital asset for admission, food selections, craft cocktails and the club's signature “dance dollars” which are used for tipping entertainers. In other words, Lightning for lap dances.Crazy Horse 3 publicist, Lindsay Feldman, said that the club is embracing the opportunity to accept Bitcoin as a way to deliver convenience and an additional level of anonymity for its guests, adding:OpenNode is a Lightning Network-powered BTC payments platform that operates in 126 countries and has more than 8,000 users. The platform will allow the venue to receive BTC payments directly without the involvement of third-party payment processors or associated fees.The adult industry has embraced cryptocurrencies over the years as much through necessity as choice, with payment processors either banning such businesses or charging them exorbitant fees for being “high risk”.Related: Las Vegas Club to Accept Bitcoin, Record Memberships on BlockchainBitcoin’s leading layer two scaling solution has seen steady growth over the past year. Since the beginning of 2021, LN nodes have increased by 56% to a record high of 12,844 at the time of writing according to BitcoinVisuals.The number of unique channels connecting nodes for the first time has also seen impressive growth this year with an increase of 54% since January 1.Bitcoin and crypto acceptance in Sin City is also showing growth. In May, the Resorts World Las Vegas casino-resort announced a partnership with crypto exchange Gemini to allow patrons to make payments using BTC and cryptocurrencies using their exchange wallets."
171,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape, and enterprise blockchain integrations.It has now been two months since the crypto crackdown and subsequent enforcement began. Most new stories are now just the trickling down of earlier national policies being enforced at a provincial level. The latest example was from the Anhui provincial government, as it announced a set of measures to reduce energy consumption, with cryptocurrency mining listed among the culprits. Anhui is a small province east of Shanghai, more known for its scenic rural landscape and agriculture than its contributions to the economic development of China. It’s likely other provinces, particularly ones that rely on coal for energy, will have similar announcements over the summer as the central government pushes for a carbon-neutral future.On July 13, Chinese mining pool giant Bit Mining announced it had raised $50 million for expansion outside of China. The company is listed on Nasdaq and operates BTC.com, which is currently a top 5 pool for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. This is another sign that Chinese mining companies aren’t giving up in light of the restrictions at home, instead choosing to relocate the data centers and mining machines abroad.The disappearing industry left a trail of impressive photographs, including some published by Financial media Caixin. One image that grabbed the attention of social media depicted a woman who appeared to be an ethnic minority holding a bundle of mining equipment and power cables like a flower bouquet.Former Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu believes that the mining regulations will benefit the industry over the long-term, citing an improved public image and eradication of bad actors. It’s certainly a nice thought, but at the moment, China seems more intent on eliminating all actors, not just the bad ones.With the upcoming Winter Olympics in February of 2022 looming, Beijing will have the perfect opportunity to show off clear blue skies and clean-energy industries. On top of that, China can showcase its state-of-the-art central bank digital currency, without the confusion stemming from more speculative digital assets that might appear to have similarities on the surface. Those with first hand memories of the 2008 Summer Olympics may also remember the strict regulation against technology and social unrest prior to that landmark event.The impact is being felt by leading exchanges in China. Huobi’s BTC/USDT pair saw only 109K BTC transacted in the past week, the lowest weekly volume dating back to October of 2018. Global exchanges were also affected by slumping volumes, but not to the degree as these predominately Chinese exchanges. In today’s regulatory climate, there’s no doubt that exchanges proactive in decentralizing operations and risk are better poised to minimize damage from unfavorable policies.On July 13, the Nanjing Public Security Research Institute announced it was working with OKLink to combat money laundering. OKLink is a blockchain technology firm that has ties to OK Group, a company that used to manage leading exchange OKex. With exchange leadership under incredible scrutiny in 2021, there is no surprise in seeing attempts to placate regulators.On July 15, cryptocurrency media company Bishijie announced it was shutting down after violating national laws against cryptocurrency. Bishije, which translates to Coin World, had enjoyed a lot of popularity in 2018, prior to the depths of the last bear market cycle. This recent bull cycle never saw it fully recover it’s previous position however, making this only a minor loss for the current cryptocurrency space. It remains to be seen whether other media platforms based in the mainland can survive this trying period of time."
172,"Trading in the direction of the trend is one of the best ways to be profitable. If traders learn to spot a new trend early, it provides an opportunity to buy with a good risk to reward ratio. In addition to identifying a trend, traders should also be able to recognize when it has reversed direction.While several patterns signal a possible trend change, one of the easiest to spot is the double bottom pattern. This can help traders change their strategy when the trend reverses direction from bearish to bullish.Let’s take a look at the double bottom pattern and identify some of the best ways to trade it.The double bottom pattern forms after a downtrend and consists of two low points that are roughly formed near a similar horizontal level, with a minor peak in between the troughs. When the price breaks out and closes above the minor peak after the formation of the second trough, the setup is complete. This is a reversal pattern, which results in an intermediate to a long-term trend change. As the pattern resembles the shape of a ‘W’, some also call it a W bottom.The above image shows the structure of the double bottom pattern. The asset has been in a downtrend but at a certain price level the bulls believe the asset is undervalued and start buying. This helps in the formation of the first bottom where demand exceeds supply and a relief rally begins.However, most bears are still not convinced that a bottom is in and they initiate short positions again after a pullback. The price turns down but when it nears the level of the first bottom, the bulls again start accumulating, which arrests the decline and starts another relief rally. The second bottom within 3% of the level of the first bottom is usually considered valid. This is not a number set in stone and traders should use their discretion in real-life trading.When the price rises above the resistance line, it signals a change in trend from down to up. The minimum target objective for the pattern can be arrived at by calculating the distance from the resistance line to the bottom and then adding the number on top of the resistance line.Let’s view a few examples to better understand the concept.Tezos (XTZ) price was in a downtrend before hitting the first bottom at $1.78 on Nov. 4, 2020. From there, the XTZ/USDT pair started a relief rally that stalled at $2.96 on Nov. 25, 2020. At this level, the bears again fancied their chances and sold aggressively.Although the pair broke below the $1.78 support and dipped to $1.57 on Dec. 23, 2020, the bears could not sustain the lower levels. The pair quickly recovered on the next day and started a recovery, forming the second bottom.The bears aggressively defended the resistance line and tried to trap the eager bulls following the breakout. The bulls purchased the dips and the pair made a strong breakout on Feb. 5, which started the new uptrend.The depth from the resistance line to the bottom is $1.18. Adding this value to the level of the resistance line at $2.96 gives a minimum pattern target at $4.14. However, in this case, the pair overshot the target objective and rallied to $5.64 on Feb. 14.Along with the daily chart, the double bottom pattern also works well on the weekly chart. This is because when the reversal setup forms on the weekly chart, it results in a long-term trend change and the new uptrend generally sustains longer.Ether (ETH) had been in a strong downtrend since topping out at $1,440 in January 2018. The demand exceeded supply when the price hit $81.70 in December 2018, resulting in the formation of the first bottom. Thereafter, the price recovered to $366.80 in June 2019 where bears again stepped in.The subsequent decline formed the second bottom at $86 in March 2020. The duration between the two bottoms is very large, but in trading, no pattern is set in stone. As both levels were close to each other and the price action forms a clear W, traders can consider this as a double bottom.The bulls pushed the price above the neckline in July 2020 but that did not start a new uptrend because the bears made one more attempt to trap the bulls. The price dipped below the breakout level but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. This showed that sentiment had changed from sell on rallies to buy on dips.That completed the reversal and the ETH/USDT pair started a strong uptrend. Although the minimum target objective of the pattern was only $651.90, the pair rose to over $4,300 during the bull run.This shows that the double bottom is an important reversal pattern, which sometimes leads to strong uptrends.Many times, traders preempt a double bottom and buy before the price breaks out of the resistance line. That could sometimes result in losses because the pattern may eventually never complete.Bitcoin (BTC) was in a downtrend since topping out at $19,798.68 in December 2017. The buyers stalled the decline at $6,000.01 on Feb. 6, 2018. Thereafter, the relief rally reached $11,786.01 on Feb. 20, 2018. This level proved to be a resistance and the price again dipped down to $6,430 on April 1, 2018.This looked like a double bottom but the bulls could not push the price above the $11,786.01 resistance. This meant the double bottom pattern did not complete.Although the $6,000 level held for a long time, the trend did not turn from down to up. Finally, the BTC/USDT pair plunged below the support and resumed the downtrend on Nov. 14, 2018.A double bottom is a key reversal pattern, which signals a change in trend but there are some important points to bear in mind.Before the first bottom forms, the trend should be down because if there is no downtrend then there will not be a reversal. Traders should wait for the pattern to complete by breaking out of the resistance line before buying because many times the pattern fails in a downtrend.When a long-term trend changes direction, it generally overshoots the pattern target of the setup. Hence, traders may use the target objective as a guideline but should not be in a hurry to close the position on that basis alone.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

173,"Crypto markets faced another day of struggle on Thursday as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to its “final support zone” near $31,000, which prompted traders to issue dire predictions about the future should bulls fail to hold this level. Despite the struggles facing the crypto market at large, relatively obscure altcoins such as Aavegotchi (GHST), Centric Cash (CNS) and Alien Worlds (TLM) posted positive gains in the past 48 hours and appear to be in a stealth accumulation mode.Aavegotchi (GHST) is a DeFi-focused nonfungible token (NFT) that operates on the Aave protocol and allows users to utilize in-game avatars called Gotchi’s as collateral to earn staking rewards.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of GHST has rallied 21% from a low of $0.997 on Wednesday to an intraday high at $1.21 on Thursday as its 24-hour trading volume doubled from the previous day.A scroll through Aavegotchi’s Twitter feed indicates that the newfound enthusiasm for GHST is a result of the upcoming release of DinoSwap, a multi-chain farming protocol that helps to attract and build liquidity on existing automated market makers.Liquidity is exploding on $GHST-WETH pair on @QuickswapDEX

Everyone's excited about @DinoSwapHQ's new liquidity mining program, launching tomorrow on @0xPolygon

The blockchain gaming platform provides a DeFi-connected NFT metaverse where users can collect and play with unique digital items in an environment that stimulates economic competition and collaboration among players.The price of TLM skyrocketed by 307% over the past week, rising from a low of $0.08 on July 9 to an intraday high at $0.33 on Thursday with a 24-hour trading volume of $884 million.Related: New data hints why Bitcoin price action has spent two months at $30KWhile there has not been a major protocol announcement that is readily identifiable as the cause for increased momentum, the project’s Twitter feed shows a handful of new NFT releases recently that can be earned through gameplay, as well as an announcement that Planet Binance will soon be added to the Alien Worlds ecosystem.We know everyone is excited about Planet Binance Missions.

174,"U.S. congressional representatives introduced a bipartisan bill on July 15 with the goal of providing a clear definition of assets, such as digital tokens and other emerging technologies, under current securities law.Known as the Security Clarity Act, the bill was introduced by Rep Tom Emmer (R-MN), Rep Darren Soto (D-FL), and Rep Ro Khanna (D-CA). This legislation seeks to change the definition of a term that has been used for more than 75 years. The status of any asset sold as an “investment contract” would become an “investment contract asset.”According to the release, this bill would provide a solution for those who have complied with current securities registration requirements or qualified for an exemption. After meeting these requirements, entrepreneurs would be able to distribute their assets without the fear of any additional regulatory burdens.Emmer elaborated:The Securities Clarity Act is meant to be a technology-neutral bill, according to the representative. It would apply equally to all assets, tangible or digital, and states an investment contract asset, like a digital token, is separate and distinct from the offering it may have been a part of.Congressman Soto explained:Emmer has stated his concern about regulation interfering with Americans benefiting from cryptocurrency before. At a hearing held in June by the US House committee on financial services, Emmer said:Related: Bitcoin sell-off continues as BTC nears $31K ahead of Powell’s speechThe introduction of this bill comes one day after the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell spoke to the House of Representatives about the need for stricter regulation for stable coins."
175,"A Canada-based Bitcoin fund, operated by 3iQ Corp, has witnessed a dramatic decline in its BTC reserves since June.Literally named the Bitcoin Fund (QBTC:CN), the closed-end investment product, was holding around 24,000 BTC in its vaults in early June. However, as the monthly session progressed, the reserves first dropped to below 16,000 BTC in a dramatic, straight-line decline.Later, another massive withdrawal pushed the Bitcoin Fund's BTC reserves to around 13,000 BTC, according to on-chain data from South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant.However, the withdrawals from the QBTC fund across June coincided with an inflow spike in 3iQ's exchange-traded fund (ETF), called 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF (BTCQ). In detail, the Canadian ETF attracted inflows of 2,088 BTC in June 2021 against the QBTC outflows of 10,432 BTC in the same month.ByteTree CIO, Charlie Morris, noted that 3iQ allowed its clients to convert their QBTC units into 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF. He added that the growth of crypto ETFs across major stock exchanges—which allows redemptions and withdrawals—prompted investors to reduce their exposure in the closed-ended fund.In comparison, 3iQ's top rival, the New York-based Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), did not witness declines in its BTC reserves. Grayscale Investments has closed GBTC since February, citing ""administrative purposes."" The closed-end fund does not allow redemptions and withdrawals.Additionally, data collected by ByteTree Asset Management shows that the 90-day inflow into the United States and Canada-based Bitcoin funds has dropped to 12,794 BTC compared to 191,846 BTC in January 2021, a 93.3% decline.The 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF (BTCQ), despite attracting 2,088 BTC in June 2021, has so far experienced outflows of 354 BTC in July 2021.Fund reserves reflect rising and declining institutional interest in Bitcoin. That is primarily because these investment products tend to work provide accredited investors ways to gain indirect exposure to crypto markets by issuing shares backed by real Bitcoin sitting in vaults.Thus, as the Bitcoin reserves on average drop across the funds, it typically suggests a lower demand for cryptocurrencies among institutional investors.Institutional investors reducing their exposure in the Bitcoin funds coincide with the Federal Reserve's hawkish signals at the end of June's Federal Open Market Committee's meeting.In detail, the U.S. central bank said mid-June that it could hike interest rates by the end of 2023 to contain prevailing inflationary pressures. It referred to the US consumer price index (CPI), a gauge to measure inflation, that surged 0.6% in May 2021 to reach a three-decade high of 4.5%; CPI climbed another 0.9% in June to reach 5.4% at its fastest pace in the last 13 years.Since the Fed's outlook, Bitcoin has dropped below $32,000. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has mostly remained inside the $30,000-34,000 price range, suggesting a mixed outlook among retail and institutional investors about the cryptocurrency's next directional bias.The bias conflict emerges despite popular narratives that pose Bitcoin as an ultimate edge against rising consumer prices. The record goes like this: Unlike the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies, Bitcoin comes with a limited supply of 21 million tokens, which makes it scarcer than inflationary currencies, and in turn, more valuable in the long run.But Bitcoin has reacted negatively to rising inflation in the previous months, prompting critics to question its safe-haven narrative, at least in the short term. For instance, Fortune covered a special section on Bitcoin's erratic response to surging consumer prices, stating that the cryptocurrency is now marching ""to its own drummer.""Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance, noted that Bitcoin had become an overvalued asset after rising from below $4,000 to a record $65,000 in almost a year. However, based on how far the cryptocurrency has come, its prices have to correct before continuing higher. Nevertheless, a Bank of America survey of fund managers also found ""long Bitcoin"" among their most crowded trades, alongside long ESG and long commodities.As Cointelegraph reported, traders are now closely watching the last major unlock dates over the next few days and weeks due to their potential impact on the cryptocurrency market.

176,"Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to its ""final support zone"" above $31,000 on July 15 as a low grind downward brought fresh predictions of a BTC price crash.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting fresh local lows of $31,550 on Thursday.The pair had made little progress overnight, falling further as Italian lawmakers said that major exchange Binance was unauthorized to trade in their jurisdiction.The latest in a series of setbacks for the exchange, a spokesperson nonetheless told the mainstream media that its operations were unaffected by the announcement.""We take a collaborative approach in working with regulators and we take our compliance obligations very seriously,"" the spokesperson commented, quoted by Reuters.As such, there remained little cause for optimism among spot traders. For popular trader Michaël van de Poppe, $31,000 represented Bitcoin's last hope of avoiding a more series dip.""Bitcoin didn't hold the $32.4K level as support and dipped lower, through which it's facing the final support zone to hold (the $31-31.5K region),"" he summarized earlier on the day.The price headache is being exacerbated by a conspicuous lack of interest among investors, with low volumes meaning a sustained bullish uptick is unlikely.Related: ‘It’s fine’ to buy Bitcoin as gold substitute, says Trump ex-Treasury Secretary MnuchinAs data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode revealed, however, it may be a seasonal, rather than an emotional phenomenon.""Investors aren't selling, they are simply on holiday,"" co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel argued, pointing to a significant reduction in exchange transaction fees.As Cointelegraph reported, further data shows that accumulation is underway even by investors who sold when BTC/USD hit $30,000 on the way to current all-time highs."
177,"The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) created an 11 million pound ($15.2 million) digital marketing campaign to warn citizens about the risks associated with crypto investments.Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, made this known in a draft speech for the agency’s webinar titled “Our Role and Business Plan” delivered on Thursday.Detailing the FCA’s decision to create the campaign fund, Rathi stated that the U.K. regulator is concerned about the increasing adoption of crypto investment among the younger demographic.According to Rathi, “more people are seeing investment as entertainment” and that such irrational behavior may lead to significant losses on their part:According to Rathi, the risks involved in crypto investments are “stark,” with the FCA boss restating the agency’s popular refrain that people should be “prepared to lose all their money” if they invest in cryptocurrencies.Related: UK advertising watchdog classifies crypto ads as ‘red alert’The FCA’s digital marketing campaign is coming on the heels of actions taken by the U.K.’s Advertising Standards Authority against crypto ads that are deemed “misleading and socially irresponsible.”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the U.K. ad watchdog agency ordered crypto exchange platform Luno to halt its “time to buy” Bitcoin (BTC) advert. Earlier in July, the advertising regulator announced a crackdown on cryptocurrency-related ads, which the body described as a “red alert” priority.Apart from the crypto warning campaign, the FCA boss also stated that the agency will continue to focus on robust examinations of “financials and business models” for operators in complex markets like cryptocurrencies, especially in the area of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance."
178,"Since the start of the summer, a series of measures from Chinese authorities to curb cryptocurrency trading and mining have dominated the crypto news cycle. From urging financial service providers to throttle cryptocurrency-related transactions to ordering a crypto trading software provider shut down, the initiatives coming out of Beijing and their repercussions are widely believed to have contributed considerably to the recent market downturn.What motivates this new round of hostile actions, and how will they affect the cryptocurrency space of the nation that had once accounted for some two-thirds of the global digital asset supply? Furthermore, it seems that whatever happens in China is having a great effect on other parts of the world, which doesn’t seem to be negative.It is not hard to notice how the intensifying clampdown on trading and mining of decentralized cryptocurrencies comes hand-in-hand with the ramping up of China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) project. As part of the Digital Currency Electronic Payment system testing, stacks of the government-issued electronic money have already landed in the wallet apps of some 200,000 Chinese citizens selected via a lottery. It looks as if larger-scale trials and wide implementation can be expected within months.When it comes to the distribution of political or economic power, Chinese leadership is not in the habit of promoting pluralism and competition. Up to a certain point, the nation’s sprawling cryptocurrency sector could eschew scrutiny, as it didn’t come into direct conflict with the government’s strategic plans, but this does not seem to be the case anymore.Yu Xiong, professor of business analytics and director of the Center for Innovation and Commercialization at the University of Surrey, told Cointelegraph that China will not allow any currency to affect the renminbi, and for that reason, it can’t allow Bitcoin (BTC) to grow too big. Xiong added:With major Chinese banks such as the Agricultural Bank of China falling in line and squishing consumer and business operations related to crypto, the concerted effort looks more like a chokehold than a lack of encouragement. On the receiving end of the government’s anti-Bitcoin push, crypto businesses and everyday users are dealing with the dire consequences of the stiffening policies.The authorities’ all-around crusade against China’s cryptocurrency sector encompasses all major groups of stakeholders: As financial service providers are waking up to their bank accounts suspended, miners in several key provinces are receiving eviction notices. The exit of the company that operated the nation’s oldest Bitcoin exchange vividly illustrates the depth of the crisis.Yifan He, CEO of Hong Kong-based blockchain firm Red Date Technology, opined to Cointelegraph that “the entire crypto industry in China is officially gone.” He thinks that while trading has always been in the area and mining was largely supported by some local governments, the current prohibitive turn in governmental policy will deal both types of activity a blow, from which they are unlikely to recover anytime soon:In He’s opinion, a fraction of crypto trading can still persist, yet it will have to migrate underground. This will essentially put an end to China’s BTC mining dominance, as miners will either have to shut down completely or relocate and be regulated in other jurisdictions.What’s being witnessed right now appears to be nothing short of the dismantling of the entire cryptocurrency industry in the country that, until recently, was a major mining and trading powerhouse.Most everyday Chinese traders will likely find the new rules prohibitive and cease trading activity. Mining businesses will face a choice between vanishing and opening up shop in a different jurisdiction. Those who appreciated the ease of transacting in digital assets will soon have a centralized alternative in the government-backed CBDC.Squashing the crypto sector on such a vast scale is inevitably echoing on the global scale as well. With much of the Chinese mining capacity gone, the hash power map of the world will have to undergo a dramatic rearrangement, with new centers of mining power emerging elsewhere to fill the void. With that, not just the firms but also the regular users will be affected in the long run, as some parts of the world will start witnessing an inflow of crypto-related business, to which regulators will start responding.It is also possible that the loss of Chinese trading activity will become a factor weighing on the global crypto market for quite some time. Building and sustaining a new bull run comparable to that of the early 2021 — a process that requires a continuous inflow of new market participants — might become more challenging, given that China is no longer able to supply the user base growth it had contributed previously. The rest of the world is going to have to try really hard to compensate for China’s departure."
179,"Specialists and lawyers focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) are launching an initiative to create a new type of legal entity in Australia representing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).The country's Digital Law Association and global law firm Herbert Smith Freehills are lobbying an Australian Senate committee to formally recognize new decentralized models for corporate governance. These new DAO models would replace the board of directors with an internet community, the Australian Financial Review reported Thursday.The initiative specifically intends to allow “DAO Limited” project governors to contract with other legal entities through DeFi tools, implementing blockchain technology to remove traditional intermediaries like banks and exchanges. Limited liability status will also prevent Australian members of a DAO from being liable for losses incurred by decisions made by a member of the community.According to the lawyers, legalizing DAOs in Australia could make the country more attractive for global digital asset businesses, as groups of local DeFi entrepreneurs reportedly shift offshore to jurisdictions like Singapore and Germany.Related: Wyoming legally recognizes first DAO in the United StatesA DAO is a decentralized organization with certain sets of rules that are encoded as a computer program and are usually based on blockchain technology. The first most important attempt to create a DAO was “The DAO,” a machine-operating venture organization launched in 2016.The news comes as some cryptocurrency exchanges are shifting to a decentralized structure. Yesterday, ShapeShift crypto exchange announced plans to open-source its platform and dissolve its entire corporate structure in a move to underscore its commitment to DeFi. “Inspired by the broader DeFi community, we’ll now help pioneer a new model of economic coordination for the 21st century. No corporate entity, no banks and no borders. The tools are ready,” ShapeShift founder and CEO Erik Voorhees said."
180,"China’s crackdown on Bitcoin (BTC) mining due to energy consumption concerns is widely regarded as the trigger for the miners’ exodus from Asia to Western countries. But new research by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance suggests that the shift in mining power started before China’s renewed scrutiny.Reuters reported that China’s total computing power connected to the Bitcoin network, or hash rate, fell from 75.5% in September 2019 to 46% in April 2021, before the Asian country even officially announced the mining crackdown.During the same 18-month period, the United States quadrupled its share of the global Bitcoin hash rate from 4% to 16.8% to become the second-largest producer of Bitcoin. Another country often named a potential destination for miners’ relocation, Kazakhstan, increased its share to 8% and became a primary Bitcoin producer.After experiencing massive power outages in the mining hub of Xinjiang in April, Chinese authorities started investigating the energy consumption involved in Bitcoin mining. Officials announced strict supervision of mining activities due to carbon concerns, triggering the relocation of several industrial miners out of China.Related: Bitcoin mining ban an easy decision for China, says Bitmain EMEA partnerCalling China’s mining ban a temporary inconvenience, iMining CEO Khurram Shroff said that the diversified location of mining facilities is great news for the rest of the world. “The Toronto Stock Exchange recently listed the world’s first Bitcoin ETF,” he exemplified, “[Canada] is already ahead of the curve in terms of mainstreaming cryptocurrencies.”Some experts see China’s crackdown on Bitcoin mining as an easy decision. Bitmain’s EMEA partner recently told Cointelegraph that the country is required to reduce its carbon footprint to get funding from the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, and Bitcoin mining was a convenient target to minimize energy consumption."
181,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be a “scam” for former United States President Donald Trump, but the former Treasury Secretary appears to have made a U-turn on the world’s first and best-known cryptocurrency.Speaking to CNBC on Wednesday, Steven Mnuchin confirmed that his perspective on Bitcoin had “evolved.”The Trump administration was known for its dismissive tone on Bitcoin in public, and those hoping for endorsement from Trump were ultimately left disappointed.Mnuchin himself was less than inclined to offer support during his Treasury tenure, but his most recent comments reveal a clear softening of his stance.“I think my view has evolved a little bit, but it is pretty consistent,” he told the network.Mnuchin added that he “would not want to have” Bitcoin in is his portfolio but stressed that he was not against others adopting it.Continuing, he expressed a desire for Bitcoin to have “complete BSA and regulatory compliance.”His words garnered praise from Bitcoin circles, with Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, calling the changes “nice to see.”Mnuchin’s perspective now sounds increasingly at odds with that of Trump’s, who last month flatly called Bitcoin a “scam” in an episode that ultimately failed to impact market sentiment.Related: Biden nominee for Treasury Dept will prioritize crypto regulationThe picture under current President Joe Biden, meanwhile, has yet to offer much to Bitcoin proponents. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has voiced concerns about cryptocurrency more widely, and senior politicians are at odds over how to address it.It is not just a U.S. predicament — El Salvador passing a Bitcoin legal tender law in June drew adverse reactions from global financial bodies including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.The law, which enters into effect in September, is so far without comparison anywhere in the world. Paraguay, which presented a regulatory bill on Bitcoin this week, has not revealed plans to adopt a “Bitcoin standard.”"
182,"The number of reachable Bitcoin network nodes has crossed the 13,000 mark for the first time. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the previous all-time high was 11,613 achieved back in January.According to data from Bitcoin network statistics dashboard Bitnodes.io, this milestone was reached back on July 5 when the number of reachable nodes clocked in at 13,374. At the time of writing, Bitnodes’ data puts the current network node count at about 12,835,Coin.Dance, another tracking website, also has Bitcoin’s node count at a new all-time high of 12,825. Nodes running the Bitcoin Core software make up 98.77% of the number, with the remaining scattered across less popular implementations like Bitcore and Bitcoin Knots.Bitcoin Core 0.21.1 was released back in May with a Taproot activation code, and at almost 5,000 nodes (according to Coin.Dance), it is currently the most utilized version of the software among entities running reachable nodes. Figures from Bitnodes put the number at 5,125, or 40% of the total network node count.Bitnodes’ data also shows at almost half of the network node count is running on Tor. Back in January, only about a quarter of all reachable nodes were running on the hidden network Tor. Running a client like Bitcoin Core using Tor provides an additional privacy layer since the IP addresses of connecting nodes are obfuscated.Related: Tor-enabled Bitcoin nodes are back after bug on networkAccording to Bitnodes’ data, the network node count has increased by 2,739 nodes in the last year, reinforcing Bitcoin’s decentralization ethos.The growth in the network node count is also akin to the expansion currently taking place in the Lightning Network ecosystem where capacity has gone up over 70% in less than six months.Earlier in July, public Lightning Network capacity crossed 1,800 Bitcoin (BTC) after adding 100 BTC in less than a week. Data from Lightning Network statistics tracker Bitcoin Visuals puts the number of LN nodes at above 12,800, which is also an all-time high value."

The newly secured funding will help Revolut continue international expansion as well as further improve marketing and product development, Revolut's chief financial officer, Mikko Salovaara, noted. The company is particularly focused on rolling out services in the U.S. and India, he added.The latest financing round reportedly makes Revolut the second-largest fintech unicorn in Europe behind Swedish fintech company Klarna. It is also now the biggest fintech in the United Kingdom, flipping major payments firm Checkout.com.Despite Revolut posting massive growth over the past year, the company has no immediate plans for an initial public offering. Salovaara said that Revolut did not rule out a potential IPO this year, but suggested it was unlikely.Revolut did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.Related: Revolut expands to Japan as its first non-English speaking marketRevolut reported nearly $240 million in annual losses last year, higher than the $140 million the company lost in 2019.

Revolut will continue its expansion into new services like crypto and stock trading to reach profitability in the long run, the CEO said recently."
185,"Market analysts are arguing that Tesla’s exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) may be the reason for its sharp decorrelation from Big Tech in recent weeks. As of Wednesday, July 14, the 20-day correlation between the company’s price and the Nasdaq 100 index has dropped from 0.83 on June 17 down to 0.14. Whereas Tesla has shed almost 4% this month, the Nasdaq 100 is up by over 2%. A weakened correlation between Tesla shares and the NYSE FANG+ index is also observable, as BNN Bloomberg reported. Amy Wu Silverman, a derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, told reporters:The EV maker’s earnings report is due on July 26. Tesla’s eventful and controversial relationship with Bitcoin dominated headlines — and arguably catalyzed a crypto market bull run — in February of this year, when the company disclosed a strategic acquisition of $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, worth 7.7% of its gross cash position at the time. It soon announced it would begin accepting BTC payments for its vehicles, indicating plans to hold, rather than convert, the Bitcoin. The company sold a portion of its Bitcoin in Q1 2021, generating net proceeds of $272 million, although Musk was keen to stress he had not himself sold any of his own BTC holdings. By May, the close link between Tesla and the veteran cryptocurrency had begun to unravel, with Musk announcing Tesla would be pulling back from BTC payments acceptance due to environmental concerns about energy-intensive Bitcoin mining. Related: Elon Musk and Bitcoin: A toxic relationshipTime will tell whether Tesla’s near-term weakened correlation with Big Tech stocks will become an established dynamic. In the crypto space, many have been more focused on the oversized impact Musk himself has had on the crypto market as a whole, most strikingly when it comes to Bitcoin and meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE)."
186,"Amid the ongoing regulatory uncertainty to cryptocurrencies in India, a high court in the country’s capital is taking action to regulate advertising by local crypto exchanges.The Delhi High Court has issued notices to local authorities and crypto firms in an effort to enforce guidelines for crypto exchanges advertising on national television, the New Indian Express reported Wednesday.The court is seeking responses from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, as well as major Indian crypto exchanges CoinDCX and WazirX, and aims to discuss the issue in August.According to the report, lawyers Ayush Shukla and Vikash Kumar have urged the court to ask the SEBI to issue ad guidelines requiring crypto audio-visual ads to include a disclaimer covering 80% of the screen, accompanied with a voiceover reading lasting at least five seconds.The petitioners reportedly said that numerous crypto ads on national TV do not include a voiceover, while the disclaimer text is displayed briefly and in small letters, usually containing a line like “cryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency, not a legal tender and subject to market risks.”Related: Crypto exchanges in India still struggling to secure banking partnersThe court’s plea reportedly stated that crypto assets are inherently riskier than traditional equity investment products, mutual funds and other investment instruments, thus requiring more measures to ensure investor protection. “An ordinary retail investor who views the audio-visual advertisement on television and online websites like Youtube may suffer immense losses as a result,” the court noted.The news comes as India still struggles to come up with clear regulations for the crypto industry in the country as anonymous alleged government sources continue stoking fears of an upcoming crypto ban. Despite the ongoing regulatory uncertainty, India’s nationwide investments in crypto have reportedly surged 600% over the past year."
187,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen almost two months of rangebound price moves after hitting $30,000 — and new data hints why.In a series of tweets on Thursday, popular Twitter commentator Nunya Bizniz presented multiple arguments supporting the significance of $30,000 for BTC/USD.Despite rising fundamentals and ongoing adoption narratives, BTC price action has failed to reestablish a bullish trend.Still 50% below recent all-time highs, Bitcoin is without direction, something that leads opinions to favor a bearish outcome of what has been eight weeks of sideways movement.For Nunyaz Bizniz, there are a number of technical factors that are converging to support $30,000 as a focal level.These include $30,000 being “approximately” the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level on the monthly chart versus the $3,100 lows in late 2018, as well as the 2021 yearly opening price.Its psychological significance is compounded by it being a round number, and as others have noted, it fits into a longer-term trendline, which places $64,500 as something of a mini-run to a blow-off top.“It’s approximately the 1.618 Fib Ext. Which in the two prior cycles was tested as support but was never closed below on the monthly chart,” accompanying comments read about the Fibonacci phenomenon.The importance for Bitcoin not to break below $30,000 and fail to reclaim it compounds existing anxiety about a full-on BTC price breakdown.Related: Bitcoin metric sees 'hell of a bounce' in move which historically heralds BTC price bottomAmid the unease, some voices caution that it is only a desire to interpret events to push one’s own narrative, bullish or bearish, which is at play.Bitcoin itself, meanwhile, is not as weak as price suggests, as fundamentals confirm.“Regardless on your risk appetite, strategizing now is key, so as not to miss the next wave in this current Bitcoin supercycle,” Stack Funds concluded in its latest report released Thursday.Nunya Bizniz, meanwhile, included Tesla’s BTC stash as a potential sticking point. Below $30,000, the user calculated, the firm would start being underwater, which may trigger executive demands to sell more in order to reduce losses.As Cointelegraph reported, investors are already back in the accumulation phase around $30,000."
188,"Publicly traded North American Bitcoin mining company Bitfarms has doubled its productivity this year amid the Chinese crackdown and resultant miner migration.The Canadian hydroelectricity mining outfit claims to be currently powering an estimated 1.5% of the entire Bitcoin (BTC) network, with more than 99% renewable green energy.In a July 14 production update, the firm revealed that it had mined 1,357 BTC in the first six months of 2021, adding that this was the largest number of BTC mined in North America, as reported by publicly traded miners.It has projected the production of more than 400 BTC for the month of July, which would be double the 199 it mined in January, and more than 50% over June’s 365 BTC mined.Bitfarms, which was founded in 2017, also stated that more than 95% of its production this year, or 1,445 BTC, has been deposited into custody as of July 12.Earlier this month, Bitcoin experienced its largest difficulty drop in history due to the mining crackdown in China and resultant closure of operations. BitInfoCharts has reported a 42.5% decline in difficulty since late May, with more than half of that occurring this month.This has resulted in Bitfarms producing significantly higher quantities of BTC at a lower cost per unit produced, the report added. The productivity boost did not prevent company stock from taking a hit in late June, as reported by Cointelegraph.Bitfarms founder and CEO Emiliano Grodzki stated that Beijing's Bitcoin mining embargo has been good news for the company, which has nearly doubled its market share as a result.The company has already begun that process with the installation of 1,500 Bitcoin miners from MicroBT in its Magog, Quebec, data center, adding 120 PH/s of total production in June 2021.Related: Nic Carter takes aim at claims Bitcoin is an environmental disasterIn a separate mining industry development, North American mining and hosting firm Compass Mining has signed a 20-year deal with nuclear fission startup Oklo, which will supply the firm with 150 megawatts of energy.According to Compass CEO, Whit Gibbs, the first Oklo mini-reactors will be deployed in 2023 or 2024 and the costs will be “considerably” lower than the energy sources firm currently uses.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, nuclear reactors do not produce air pollution or carbon dioxide while operating. However, the major environmental concern related to them is the creation of radioactive waste.Compass is also in talks with the crypto-friendly city of Miami about getting power from the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant, according to a Nasdaq report."
189,"In early 2021 Bitcoin and Ether price was the center of attention as each asset seemed to hit a new all-time high every 24-hours and traders called for $100,000 BTC and $5,000 ETH. Fast forward to the present and both assets are still more than 40% down from their all-time highs and the bulls calling for unbelievable price targets are nowhere to be found.    A recent report from CoinMetrics reviewed the performance of Bitcoin and altcoins during Q2 2021 and the analysts found that even with the sharp May 19 market correction many assets finished the quarter in the green with Dogecoin (DOGE) coming out on top with a  392% gain.Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Polygon (MATIC) were the other two breakaway stars of Q2, with each gaining 297% and 227% respectively despite a nearly 39% decline in the price of Bitcoin.One of the biggest developments during Q2 was the Ether price breakout from $1,971 on April 1 to a new record high of $4,362 on May 11 before the market-wide sell-off resulted in a quarterly close at $2,240, which represents a 13.2% gain.CoinMetrics highlighted that Ether price “benefited from a renewed surge of retail interest which was partially driven by the rapid rise of NFTs.”As a result of the retail surge, the number of addresses holding at least 0.1 Ether increased from 4.58 million to more than 5.20 million.Ether’s positive finish, when compared to the significant decline in Bitcoin, is also indicative of the increased attention the top-ranked altcoin is receiving from institutional investors looking to diversify away from BTC.As mentioned earlier, the best performance in Q2 came from DOGE, which managed to finish the quarter up 392% despite a 66% decline from its $0.74 all-time high set back on May 8.According to the report, the number of addresses holding at least 1 DOGE increased from 3.09 million on April 1 to 3.7 million addresses on June 30. DOGE addresses continued to increase in the month of June while new Ether addresses essentially flatlined at the end of May.As a result of the gains made by altcoins, Bitcoin dominance fell to 45% on June 30, its lowest level since July 2018.CoinMetrics pointed out that the significant headwinds BTC faced were partially a result of China’s crackdown on cryptocurrency mining, which resulted in a 50% decline in hash rate in Q2 to its lowest level since late 2019.Related: Bitcoin mining ban an easy decision for China, says Bitmain EMEA partnerThis decline is likely temporary and the hash rate “should eventually recover once miners start to power back up in their new locations,” but CoinMetrics warned that this “won’t happen overnight since it will take time to build and set up enough facilities to accommodate the sudden influx of new demand.”Overall, CoinMetrics and other analysts see the development as a long-term positive development for the Bitcoin ecosystem headed forward.CoinMetrics said:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

190,"Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States (Fed) told the House of Representatives today that stablecoins should face stricter regulations similar to money market funds or bank deposits. Powell was asked specifically about Tether (USDT), currently the most valuable stablecoin, by Representative Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH). Tether claimed that each coin was backed by a dollar, but that has been proven false. Rather, it is backed mostly by commercial paper or debts. Powell said most of the time those assets are very liquid, but during the recent financial crisis that wasn’t the case. He explained:""The market just disappears. And that’s when people will want their money. It’s very simple: These are economic activities very similar to bank deposits and money market funds, and they need to be regulated in comparable ways,”Powell went on to say that if Stablecoins are going to be a part of the payment universe, then regulations need to be put in place, as a regulatory framework currently “doesn’t exist, really, for stablecoins.”He also added that he doesn’t see volatile crypto assets as being a part of the payment universe in the future. Crypto assets were mentioned in the 75-page Monetary Policy Report released last Friday. The call out was merely a single sentence, mentioned in the context of “risky assets” saying:“The surge in the prices of a variety of crypto-assets also reflects in part increased risk appetite.”Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) said a Central Bank Digital Currency, or CBDC, would cut down on the number of cryptocurrencies being launched:“You wouldn’t need stablecoins, you wouldn’t need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital U.S. currency. I think that’s one of the strong arguments in its favor.”Powell said a paper that focuses on the benefits and risks associated with a CBDC in the US will be out sometime in September.He also responded to a question about the record inflation rates the US is experiencing, saying they have “increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating.”Related: Bitcoin rebounds from $33K support as US dollar inflation comes back into focusPowell stood by his previous statements that the increase is temporary and that once certain markets, like used cars, are back to pre-pandemic conditions, it will likely return to normal.Powell will be speaking before the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate tomorrow."

192,"In the early hours of July 14, Bitcoin price took a surprise hit to $31,550 before slowly recovering back above $32,900 in the morning session. The swift drop near the crucial $30,000 resistance raised alarms among bulls and bears and whilst the $30,000 to $32,000 level continues to function as a support level, a recent market update from ByteTree CEO James Bennett paints a mixed picture of what may be in store for BTC.According to analysis from Bennett, the price of Bitcoin has stabilized near the $34,000 level due to a reduction in miner selling and an increase in accumulation, but he also warns that several metrics show that decreased activity on the network hint that BTC is still in a neutral zone where there is a reduced appetite from key players.According to Bennett weekly Bitcoin transactions have been in a sharp downturn since April and now sit near 1.48 million transactions which is down from the Jan. 9 high at 2.57 million.As a result of the current market downturn and drop in transactions, the total value transacted on the Bitcoin network has fallen to $23.6 billion, the lowest level seen since December 2020.Bennett said that due to the decline in on-chain activity:Bitcoin velocity hit an all-time low of 195% on July 11, a significant decline from its recent high of 593% on May 23. The velocity is “a non-price indicator and measures the vibrancy of the Bitcoin network” according to Bennett.Bennett said:Related: BlackRock CEO signals low demand for crypto from long-term investorsOne positive sign in the market is the recent uptick in miner accumulation. This figure had dropped in recent months due to China cracking down on mining operations to the extent that many have completely shut down and are in the process of relocating to other countries.As the BTC inventory held by miners stabilized and began to tick upward, Bennett suggested that miners are once again accumulating and this can be interpreted as a signal that Bitcoin price could be in the process of stabilizing.The Institutional Dominance Ratio, a measure that monitors the top fifth quintile of the Bitcoin heat map, also shows an increase beginning on July 12. This suggests that large Bitcoin holders have increased their activity in the past couple of days while the price of Bitcoin has held above $31,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

193,"Bitcoin (BTC) has once again held the critical support area at $31,000 today, indicating accumulation at lower levels. This led some analysts to speculate that traders were selling their holdings to investors with a low history of selling in anticipation that “a supply shock” to occur when the re-accumulation process completes.Another sign of strong hands entering the crypto market was seen when Capital International Group, a $2.3 trillion asset manager, purchased a 12.3% stake in MicroStrategy, which many believe to be a sort of Bitcoin proxy stock because it holds 105,084 Bitcoin on its books. This acquisition suggests the asset manager is taking indirect exposure to Bitcoin.The United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged 0.9% in June 2021 over the previous month and 5.4% from a year earlier, this is the fastest pace in nearly 13 years. However, Bitcoin’s failure to respond positively to the spike in inflation has ignited a debate on Bitcoin’s billing as an inflation hedge. News outlet Fortune said this made Bitcoin a doubtful hedge against inflation.In a bear phase, the markets usually tend to overlook the triggers in the short term. During such a period, the smart money continues to accumulate and eventually, the price action catches up with fundamentals. Therefore, writing off Bitcoin with only a few months of data may not be the right thing to do.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the critical support and resistance levels, which may signal the start of the next trending move.The long tail on Bitcoin’s candlestick today indicates that bulls are defending the $31,000 level aggressively. However, buyers will face a stiff resistance from the bears at the 20-day exponential moving average ($33,973).If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on every minor rally. The bears will then make one more attempt to sink the price below $31,000.If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could challenge the next critical support at $28,000. This may be a make-or-break level for the bulls because if it cracks, the selling may intensify. The next major support on the downside is $20,000.Contrary to this assumption, if bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could reach the 50-day simple moving average ($35,361). A breakout and close above this level will be the first indication that sellers are losing their grip.That will also increase the possibility of a break above $36,670. If that happens, the pair could start its journey toward the $41,330 to $42,451.67 resistance zone.The failure of the bulls to push (ETH) above the 20-day EMA ($2,135) from July 9 to 12 may have attracted selling by short-term traders. That pulled the price below the psychological level at $2,000 on July 13.However, the bears could not sustain the selling pressure and sink the price to the critical support at $1,738.74. This is a positive sign as it shows buying at lower levels.The bulls will now once again try to propel the price above the moving averages. If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will indicate a possible change in trend.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the price to $1,728.74. A break below this support could start the next leg of the downtrend.Binance Coin (BNB) slipped below the 20-day EMA ($313) on July 13, indicating that bears are trying to gain the upper hand. However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that bulls are not willing to give up and are buying on dips.The flat moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($331) to signal strength.That will clear the path for an up-move to $379.58 and later to the stiff overhead resistance at $433. On the contrary, if the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, the bears will try to pull the BNB/USDT pair below the $276.40 to $264.26 support zone. If they succeed, the decline could extend to $251.41 and then to $211.70.The failure of the bulls to push Cardano (ADA) above the 20-day EMA ($1.35) from July 9 to 12 may have resulted in profit-booking by short-term traders. That pulled the price below the $1.28 support on July 13.The long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that bulls are attempting to defend the support at $1.19. However, the 20-day EMA has started to slope down and the RSI has tumbled below 42, suggesting that bears have the upper hand.If the price turns down from $1.28, it will indicate selling on minor rallies and that will increase the prospects of a decline to $1.10 and then $1. Alternatively, if bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, it will signal strength. The ADA/USDT pair may then rise to the 50-day SMA ($1.46).XRP has gradually drifted down to the horizontal support at $0.59. This is an important level for the bulls because if they fail to defend it, the bears will attack the June 22 low at $0.50.The declining moving averages and the RSI below 40 suggest that bears are in command. A break and close below $0.50 will open the doors for a possible decline to $0.45 and then to $0.40.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the current level, the buyers will make one more attempt to clear the hurdle at the 20-day EMA ($0.66). If they manage to do that, the XRP/USDT pair could rise to $0.75. A breakout and close above this level will signal strength.Dogecoin (DOGE) broke and closed below the $0.21 support on July 12, which suggests that supply exceeds demand. The failure of the bulls to defend $0.21 clears the path for a retest of the critical level at $0.15.The descending moving averages and the RSI below 36 indicate that bears are in control. If bears pull the price below the $0.15 support, the selling could intensify and the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to $0.10.However, the $0.15 level has held on two previous occasions, hence the bulls may again try to defend it aggressively. A strong bounce off it could push the price to the overhead resistance at $0.21. A breakout and close above the 20-day EMA ($0.23) will signal that bulls are trying to make a comeback.Polkadot’s (DOT) tight consolidation between $14.50 and $16.93 ended with a breakdown on July 13, which shows that supply exceeds demand. That pulled the price down to the critical support at $13.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 37 indicate that bears are in control. A break and close below the $13 support will suggest the resumption of the downtrend. The next support is the psychological level at $10.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the current level, the bulls will try to push the price above $14.50. If they succeed, it will indicate accumulation at lower levels. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above $16.93. If this happens it could set the stage for a strong relief rally.Uniswap (UNI) broke below the 20-day EMA ($19.81) on July 12, which indicates that bears have overpowered the bulls. There is a minor support at $16.93 but if the level gives in, the altcoin could drop to $15 and then to $13.The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI has dropped into the negative zone, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. A breakdown and close below $13 will complete a descending triangle pattern, suggesting the start of the next leg of the downtrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the current level or $15, the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, the bearish setup will invalidate and the UNI/USDT pair could move up to $25 and then $27.Related: Brazilian securities regulator approves Ether ETFThe tight range trading in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) between $475.69 and $538.11 resolved to the downside on July 13. This suggests that supply exceeds demand as bulls are not confident that a bottom has been made.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting an advantage to the bears. If the price sustains below $475, the BCH/USDT pair could gradually drop to $428 and then to the next major support at $370.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that bulls are attempting to push the price back above $475.69. If they manage to do that, it will indicate buying at lower levels. A breakout and close above $538.11 will be the first sign of the start of a stronger relief rally.Litecoin (LTC) is trading inside a descending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close below $118. The long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that bulls are attempting to defend the support.However, both moving averages are sloping down gradually and the RSI is below 40, suggesting that bears are in control. Any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the downtrend line. If the price turns down from this level and breaks below $118, the LTC/USDT pair could resume the downtrend.The next support on the downside is the psychological level at $100 but if it cracks, the decline could extend to $70. On the contrary, if the bulls drive the price above the downtrend line, it will invalidate the pattern. The pair could then rise to the 50-day SMA ($154) and later to $180.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

194,"The European Central Bank, or ECB, joins the growing club of crypto-friendly financial institutions as it announces the decision “to launch a project to prepare for possibly issuing a digital euro.” The ECB’s official tweet noted:According to a press release on July 14, the ECB's governing council has launched the investigation phase of a digital euro project. This phase is planned to last for two years, during which time Eurogroup will design a digital currency focused on “users’ preferences and technical advice by merchants and intermediaries.”Sharing more insights, the ECB’s official statement also highlighted their success in identifying the various ways to protect it’s user’s privacy, in tune with the nation’s GDPR requirements. They added:One of ECB’s executive board members, Fabio Panetta, clarified that the success of the digital euro will be heavily dependent on the value it adds for “people, merchants and financial intermediaries in the euro area.”Related: UAE to experiment and launch an in-house digital currencyOn a similar timeline, the United Arab Emirates also announced an interest in launching a digital version of the nation's fiat. In the three-year plan spanning from 2023-2026, the Central Bank of the UAE intends to be among the top 10 financial leaders across the globe. In what seems increasingly common in 2021, banking giants around the world are announcing their interest in experimenting with various types of crypto assets. Recently, Vietnam’s prime minister Phạm Minh Chính asked the State Bank of Vietnam to begin trialing its own digital currency.While the crypto ecosystem faces enormous mainstream resistance, governments are now cautious about missing out on the underlying innovation. As more and more leaders continue to share their interest in trying out digital currencies, Bitcoin is set to redefine the “B” in banking."
195,"Bitcoin (BTC) failed to crack $33,000 on July 14 as a bounce from multi-day lows delivered only modest progress.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked another day of ranging — albeit with increased volatility — for BTC/USD on Wednesday.The pair briefly touched $31,750 overnight before a sharp rebound produced highs of $32,970. This meant that $33,000, once firm support, still remained out of reach.For popular trader Michaël van de Poppe, this zone from $32,600 upwards was ""critical to break"" in order for Bitcoin to have a chance at hitting targets higher up in its trading range.""Many altcoins making double bottom tests.

196,"BlackRock, an institutional asset manager that has indirect exposure to Bitcoin (BTC), has recorded a major decline in investor demand for cryptocurrency.The company’s CEO Larry Fink declared Wednesday on CNBC’s Squawk Box that BlackRock has been seeing less crypto-related queries from investors recently, signaling a massive drop in demand for crypto.Fink noted that specifically long-term and retirement investors now appear to have less interest in crypto, stating:Fink’s remarks come amid a continued sideways trading on the cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin dropping over 16% over the past 30 days. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $32,572, slightly up around 0.3% over the past 24 hours. The most-valued cryptocurrency has lost almost half of its price since BTC broke its all-time high in mid-April, surging above $64,000.BlackRock is known for its friendly stance on Bitcoin as the company obtained indirect exposure to Bitcoin through its ownership stake in business intelligence firm MicroStrategy.

197,"A decentralized exchange says its unique dual mining mechanism delivers transaction fees that are “close to zero” — including for major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.MDEX says a blend of liquidity mining and transaction mining results in a deeper liquidity pool and lower slippage, as well as a more user-friendly experience.Data from CoinMarketCap shows that transaction volumes across the blockchains it uses have surpassed big names such as PancakeSwap, Sushiswap and 1inch.MDEX has come a long way since the project launched on Jan. 6. Within a month, the project claims single-day transaction volumes exceeded $1 billion — a figure that doubled to $2 billion by Feb. 19.The project has regularly updated a roadmap to inform users of the features that lie ahead. MDEX had initially supported Ethereum and Huobi Eco Chain only, but this was expanded to Binance Smart Chain by April 8. This was followed by MDX being included in Binance’s Innovation Zone the following month.MDEX says that the market for DeFi products has suffered from a high degree of fragmentation so far. Many prominent DEXs, such as Uniswap and SushiSwap, only support Ethereum. This has proven problematic as the blockchain battles astronomical fees, with a number of projects seeking rival networks that are cheaper and more scalable.However, MDEX delivers token swaps across three blockchains — Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Huobi Eco Chain — giving crypto enthusiasts choice.Supporting three distinctive networks helps to solve this problem and ensures that DeFi users have everything they need in one place. It can also deliver enhanced levels of liquidity — and makes it easier for investors to find opportunities that pique their interest.MDEX also supports single token staking and offers IMOs — initial MDEX offerings — something that gives new projects the support they need as they plan to enter the market. A rather distinctive feature called “fun buyback” provides a degree of gamification for those who contribute MDX, the platform’s native token, to the burning pool.MORE INSIGHTS FROM MDEX HEREComparing itself against rivals, MDEX says one of the most compelling benefits of its offering lies in how it provides low transaction fees. All of this comes after costs increased to “unimaginable heights” on Ethereum-based DEXs.The fact that MDEX has been built on Huobi Eco Chain also delivers enhanced speeds. This blockchain can achieve up to 500 transactions per second with a transaction confirmation time of under three seconds. Developers at the project say this is a stark contrast to Uniswap, where it can take a minute for a transaction to finalize because of the congestion seen on the Ethereum mainnet.MDEX describes itself as the leading decentralized app on HECO, and says its DEX has been instrumental in increasing awareness about the network. Of course, there’s still plenty more work to be done. The platform says it intends to attract more users and enhance the trading experience by listing more multi-chain assets and strengthening community governance.Learn more about MDEXDisclaimer.

198,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price continued its downtrend Wednesday ahead of the testimony from United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.The spot BTC/USD exchange rate fell to its 17-day low of $31,600 following a 3.46% intraday dip. Meanwhile, CME futures tied to the pair plunged 3.41% to $31,515, extending their week-to-date losses to 9.5%.Bitcoin had powered to $35,000 at the beginning of July, as bulls continued to defend support levels around $30,000 against each downside attempt.Independent market analyst Will Clemente III noted that entities with a low history of selling kept absorbing Bitcoin at lower levels from speculative traders, adding that the strategy is in the process of effectively removing a good BTC supply out of the market.“Given no capitulation event, in my humble opinion, it is a matter of ‘when’ the re-accumulation process will be finished rather than ‘if,’” Clemente wrote.Bitcoin sold off at $35,000 and dropped to near $31,500 during the Wednesday session. One factor that made traders cautious is uncertainty about how the Federal Reserve would respond to the bout of higher inflation — now running upward at its fastest pace in 13 years.In detail, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.9% in June 2021 from the previous month and by 5.4% compared to June 2020. The higher inflation readings honed focus on Powell’s appearance before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday at 9:30 am EST.The central bank chief expects to clarify his position on the ongoing spike in consumer-related inflation. In his earlier statements, Powell has suggested that the Fed should move cautiously unless it sees a “maximum recovery” in the U.S. labor markets.Therefore, with support from some like-minded dovish Fed officials, including New York branch head John Williams, Powell might ignore trimming the Fed’s $120-billion monthly asset purchase program in the wake of strong U.S. growth and high inflation.Meanwhile, Evercore ISI economist Peter Williams forecasted that rising CPI readings would increase tensions among the Federal Open Market Committee’s members.He noted that some hawkish members might demand tapering to begin as early as September, albeit adding that the Fed, in general, would follow a wait-and-watch approach, thinking inflation is transitory in nature.As for Bitcoin, the outlook remains mixed, especially after the cryptocurrency failed to respond to inflation alarms in recent months, China’s crackdown on the crypto sector, increasing regulatory scrutiny, the Fed’s rate hike plans for 2023, and Elon Musk’s anti-crypto tweets.Fortune reported that Bitcoin is marching “on its own drummer,” ignoring the recent spikes in key inflation metrics. That makes the cryptocurrency a doubtful hedge against rising consumer prices.However, Joel Kruger, a forex strategist at London-based investment firm LMAX, thinks differently. The analyst noted that Bitcoin’s long-term prospects remain skewed to the upside because there’s a “legit fear of rising inflation.”“Setbacks more about SOME investors looking at Bitcoin as a risk correlated emerging asset,” he tweeted late Tuesday.Additionally, Greg Waisman, co-founder and chief operating officer of cryptocurrency infrastructure company Mercuryo, offered a more critical outlook.First, he noted that macro investors do not believe in Bitcoin’s true value even against rising inflation. And second, he projected Ether (ETH) as a better cryptocurrency, given its recent run-up against Bitcoin.“Bitcoin is the most expensive and renowned cryptocurrency, but it’s not a cryptocurrency of the present,” Waisman explained, adding:Currently, lackluster volumes and a two-month-old downside move continue to keep Bitcoin in a bearish state.Since May 20, the BTC/USD exchange rate has been trending lower inside a falling parallel channel, rebounding off its support trendline and pulling back lower upon testing resistance. At the same time, the $30,000–$32,000 area has been providing a confluence of additional support.The pair appears to be heading back toward the lower trendline following the latest retest of the Channel’s upper trendline. However, the short target in the current scenario is below $30,000 (toward the Q2 bottom of $28,732).Conversely, a break north of the Channel’s resistance trendline could have BTC/USD test the 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the blue wave) at $35,363 as the next upside target. The area has witnessed sell-offs in the recent sessions.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

199,"Amid a massive spike of the United States’ Consumer Price Index (CPI), the cryptocurrency community has been divided on whether Bitcoin (BTC) is really a hedge to inflation.The CPI, an indicator measuring the average change in prices that consumers pay for a basket of goods and services, saw its largest one-month increase in June over the past 13 years, Business Insider reported Tuesday. The inflation surge reportedly started in March, when CPI rose by 2.6%, followed by subsequent increases in April of 4.2% and eventually 5.4% in June.But despite the recent growth in CPI-measured inflation, Bitcoin has allegedly failed as an inflation hedge as its price has almost halved from $64,000 in mid-April, according to some analysts.Interesting that as CPI #inflation has climbed from +1.4% y/y in January to 5.4% in June, #Bitcoin has essentially been cut in half
[Past performance is no guarantee of future results] pic.twitter.com/QIXeb2m5Vv“Bitcoin isn’t behaving like an inflation hedge anymore and will continue to remain heavy over expectations over higher yields,” Ed Moya, senior equity analyst at foreign exchange firm Oanda, said in a Tuesday note. However, that inflation is viewed as transitory, which could be a reason why the June CPI report wasn’t enough of a catalyst to break Bitcoin’s sideways trading, Moya added.The crypto community subsequently reacted to these CPI-versus-Bitcoin observations, with many industry advocates emphasizing that their early Bitcoin investment and gains “have already hedged the future.” Some Bitcoin enthusiasts pointed out that Bitcoin has been growing historically, posting massive gains over the long term.InFlaTioN hEdGe #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/OjhUY5OLJVRelated: Bitcoin boon as US inflation hits 13-year high, wages fall to lowest in 21st centuryAccording to some crypto experts, Bitcoin is indeed “not a great hedge against inflation.” Mati Greenspan, founder of money management firm Quantum Economics, told Cointelegraph that there “doesn’t seem to be any correlation” between Bitcoin’s price action and inflation or deflation data, stating:The latest CPI-triggered argument brings another twist in long-running debates regarding Bitcoin as a hedge instrument. A number of financial analysts, including Nassim Taleb, believe that inflation has nothing to do with Bitcoin’s price. Still, some global investors, such as Paul Tudor Jones, have moved into Bitcoin to protect their investments from inflation."

201,"Two weeks after a 15% increase in electricity prices in Turkey, a new store selling professional mining equipment has opened its doors in Istanbul — the business hub of the country — on Tuesday.Opening a mining equipment shop in a country with costly electricity seems counterintuitive. But Phoenix Store, Bitmain’s sales partner in the Middle East, did the math before opening its second store within the region. Phoenix Store CEO Phil Harvey explained that the company’s primary goal with the Istanbul store is to educate Turkey’s crypto-friendly population about crypto mining. Then, customers can purchase mining equipment and hosting services that would operate in Canada, the United States or Russia. Mining in Turkey is simply unfeasible.“It’s like you want to invest in gold mining,” he said, “You can come here and invest in a gold mine, but it’s not going to be in the back garden. It’s going to be outside.”Cointelegraph Turkey sat down with Harvey after his presentation to learn more about the crypto mining landscape in the aftermath of China’s crackdown on mining operations.“China needs to maintain its current growth for the projects in the country,” Harvey started, detailing the crackdown. The country is required to improve several areas, such as reducing its carbon footprint, to get funding from the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank:It’s a significant revenue stream, but even that would pale in comparison to how much the IMF or World Bank invest in China for projects like road initiatives. “So it was an easy decision for China to make to remove these miners and reduce the carbon footprint that they have,” Harvey added.While several miners announced that they would relocate to cold-climate countries like Canada, Harvey believes that half of what’s lost due to China’s crackdown will never go back online:Related: China crypto ban is a ‘huge opportunity for Canada,’ mining group head saysThe value per machine might be $150–$200 at most, and it would take about the same amount of money per unit to relocate them. “It doesn’t make sense to do that,” he said, “That’s why I say half of what was on the network that we lost.”Harvey expects regions such as Russia and Kazakhstan to increase their share in the mining landscape with new machines added to the network, but he doesn’t plan to open new stores in those countries for now. After Dubai and Istanbul, Phoenix only plans to open a store in London. “We won’t expand any further for the stores outside of those three locations,” he said."
202,"The Chinese government continues cracking down on the cryptocurrency mining industry by suspending crypto mining operations in another province.Authorities at Anhui, a small province in eastern China, have announced a set of measures to tackle growing electricity demand and an associated power supply shortage in the next three years, local news agency Hefei Online reported on Wednesday.As part of Anhui’s efforts to curb energy consumption, the province plans to shut down crypto mining projects and scrutinize new initiatives that require large amounts of energy consumption. Local authorities also plan to adopt new practices for building data centers as well as promote the reform of electricity prices in order to optimize energy usage in the province.The Anhui province of China is known for once being one of China’s poorest provinces, having only been removed from the country’s official list of impoverished areas in 2020. Anhui is the eighth largest province in the country by population. The province’s power grid reportedly comprises mostly coal-based power plants in addition to several hydropower facilities as well as wind- and solar-based plants.Related: Chinese hydropower plants on sale as crypto miners move abroadSome reports suggest that the latest regulatory crackdown in Anhui is part of a broader country-wide initiative to shut down all crypto mining operations across China.Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu reported Wednesday that China's State Grid Corporation has issued a notice to all parts of the country requesting the closure of virtual currency mining. “At present, some provinces with insufficient power in China, such as Henan and Anhui, have also begun to implement it,” he added.The State Grid Corporation of China has issued a notice to all parts of the country requesting the closure of virtual currency mining.

203,"Bitcoin (BTC) is seeing a “reset” in investor behavior at $30,000 and the trend need only continue to spark a price rise.According to on-chain monitoring resource Ecoinometrics on Tuesday, the only way is “up” for BTC/USD if hodlers continue accumulating coins.Analyzing who bought coins since the start of the latest bull run in October 2020, Ecoinometrics showed that major change is afoot compared to last year.At the start, it was smaller investors, or “small fish,” who were accumulating. This began when Bitcoin passed its previous all-time high of $20,000 and continued all the way up to the new peak of $64,500.At $20,000, however, larger investors began selling, albeit not in sufficient quantities to end the bull run.Whales, on the other hand, added selling pressure once BTC/USD hit $30,000 for the first time. The result, analysts say, was the tipping point at May’s highs.“Apparently $30k is a key level that stopped the trend of coins accumulation by whales,” Ecoinometrics commented.The reason that selling pressure ultimately took over could lie with whale sentiment that Bitcoin was gaining “too much, too soon” and that the market was thus deemed unsustainable.Now that $30,000 has returned, cold feet are nowhere to be found — investors, both big and small, are buying again.“Whales and small fish have started accumulating again while other categories have turned neutral,” the findings continue.That perspective provides a refreshing counterargument to the bearish tone taken by many market commentators over the past few weeks.Related: Bitcoin price will see breakout ‘during this week’ says trader with $38K targetEven the classic stock-to-flow price model has fielded concerns of invalidation, something its creator denies, while on-chain activity has been marked by low volumes and a lack of solid support above $30,000.Calls for a major price move are not in short supply, meanwhile, with hopes for an upward move lingering despite sliding below $32,000 on Wednesday."
204,"It's not yet known whether Binance's recent news of  being temporarily suspended from the U.K.’s financial system is the main driver behind today's Bitcoin (BTC) price drop. As Cointelegraph reported, the exchange sent emails to affected customers but has not given any details.Regardless of the reason behind the price weakness, derivatives contracts started to display some oddities, and this could be a troubling sign.Bitcoin quarterly futures are the preferred instruments of whales and arbitrage desks. Although it might seem complicated for retail traders due to their settlement date and price difference from spot markets, their most significant advantage is the lack of a fluctuating funding rate.When traders opt for perpetual contracts (inverse swaps), there is a fee usually charged every 8-hours that will change depending on which side demands more leverage. On the other hand, fixed-date expiry contracts typically trade at a premium from regular spot market exchanges.This effect occurs as sellers are postponing settlement, therefore requesting compensation for this time.As depicted above, the Sept. 24 contract is trading with a 2.2% annualized premium at Deribit, while the Dec. 31 contract is at 3.8%. This curve is precisely what one should expect in healthy markets because a longer settlement period would usually cause sellers to request a more substantial premium.Keep in mind that there's a decent 'Cash and Carry' activity being deployed by arbitrage desks, buying Bitcoin while simultaneously shorting (selling) the futures contract. These players aren't effectively betting on a negative price swing as their net exposure is flat, but this activity limits the premium on futures contracts.Related: Bitcoin price is down, but here’s 3 reasons why $1B liquidations are less frequentTherefore, a couple of exchanges presenting a flat or slightly inverted futures' curve should not be interpreted as a bearish indicator. More importantly, investors should measure the 3-month futures premium, which should stay above 4% annualized.Whenever this metric falls below that, it indicates a lack of interest in leverage longs and is interpreted as bearish.Currently, the average September annualized basis (premium) of the four exchanges examined is running at 3.3%, which is definitively worrisome.However, this is not unusual after the market experienced a 50% correction. This situation should simply be interpreted as a lack of confidence from buyers instead of an alarming bearish sign.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Gold rose in tandem, with XAU/USD up 0.7% at $1,813."
209,"India’s stance on crypto adoption has been a gray area ever since the birth of Bitcoin (BTC). In what seems like another blow for the Indian crypto community, one of the biggest financial services, ICICI Bank, has warned users not to use their remittance services for transferring any form of crypto or digital currency.In ICICI’s latest iteration of the Retail Outward Remittance Application form, the bank has clearly stated its intent to stop users from using the service for crypto transfers. Based on the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999, the declaration states: The major banking institution has shared two more points that reiterate its anti-adoption stance, further warning users not to use its remittance service for investing in companies that deal with Bitcoin or any other crypto and digital currencies.Users were also warned not to send any funds that may have been procured via crypto investments in the past. However, the Indian government has not yet shown resistance to blockchain-based financial applications.ICICI’s move to use FEMA 1999 against crypto adoption is consistent with other banking players in the country ever since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced to ban banks that do business with crypto-related firms back in April 2018.Related: India Supreme Court Lifts RBI Ban on Banks Servicing Crypto FirmsContrary to ICICI’s latest move to disregard crypto enthusiasts, the Supreme Court of India has contradicted the RBI’s ban on crypto-friendly banks. As a result of this confusion, India’s crypto investors continue to find loopholes in the system to grow their crypto portfolio.While government officials continue to postpone the date of the inevitable, the evident lack of regulatory clarity on crypto investments has a direct impact on investors and the country’s fintech innovation. On the other end of the spectrum, India’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance-owned WazirX, continues to see a rise in trade volumes and new users, owing to RBI’s clarification on the removal of the ban based on the Supreme Court’s verdict.

210,"Crypto market capitalization is down more than 40% since its $2.5-trillion high back in early May, but institutional investors continue to pile into the market. Despite Bitcoin (BTC) losing over half of its United States dollar value and altcoins tanking almost 70% on average, big-money players like hedge funds are still taking up digital currency investment positions.From direct exposure to crypto to backing firms developing products and services in the digital asset space, institutional investors are building a more significant presence in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Back in June, a survey of 100 chief financial officers at hedge funds across the world indicated an expected increase in crypto exposure for hedge funds in the next five years.As regulated entities continue to explore digital currency investment options, crypto regulations also seem to be taking shape in many jurisdictions. Meanwhile, in the U.S., regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission are coming under significant pressure to enact a stricter legal framework for cryptocurrencies.Earlier in July, Cointelegraph reported that London-based hedge fund giant Marshall Wace was set to create an investment portfolio focused on digital assets. According to the report, the $55-billion hedge fund was looking toward late-stage funding for digital finance companies and blockchain outfits working on use cases such as payment systems for digital currencies and stablecoins.Amit Rajpal, CEO of Marshall Wace Asia Limited, outlined the company’s digital asset investment thesis, stating that the focus is on projects working toward redefining financial services, especially in the area of payments. According to Rajpal, digital finance is already changing the architecture of the underlying financial system.Even before reports of its crypto-focused investment portfolio emerged, Marshall Wace had made some forays into the digital asset space. Back in May, the hedge fund participated in USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin issuer Circle’s $440-million fundraising round.Marshall Wace is only the latest in a growing list of hedge funds and other institutional investors exploring crypto investment options. In April, United Kingdom-based asset management outfit Brevan Howard floated an $84-million crypto investment fund.Speaking to Cointelegraph China earlier in July, Cornell University professor and Avalanche creator Emin Gün Sirer stated that the current market downturn had done little to dampen enthusiasm for crypto exposure among institutional investors. According to Sirer, the legitimacy of crypto as an asset class is “beyond question,” stating:Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto hedge fund BitBull Capital, also echoed Sirer’s comments, telling Cointelegraph, “Institutional investors are still interested and continue to build positions at key support levels.”“Naturally, the market hype has dampened, but these downturns have been historically opportune moments for long-term entries,” the BitBull Capital CEO added.A spokesperson for Nickel Digital Asset Management, a $200-million crypto hedge fund, also provided some insight into the emerging strategies among institutional players amid the current range-bound trading for cryptocurrencies. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, the Nickel Digital representative said, “We are seeing active and continuous engagement from the entire institutional community, including (but not limited to) pensions, foundations, endowments and funds of hedge funds,” adding:Indeed, Nickel Digital recently rebalanced its cash position as a result of the current market decline in a move the company described as an exercise in “financial discipline.” According to the fund’s CEO, Anatoly Crachilov, Nickel Digital is keeping its investment powder dry for the future return of parabolic price gains in the crypto market.As more institutional players make crypto forays, stakeholders say asset managers are not worried about regulatory risks. Indeed, the bulk of attention from financial regulators appears to be focused on protection for retail investors.Meanwhile, banks and other regulated entities seem to be getting clearer mandates from regulatory bodies to interact with digital assets. Commenting on the advantages created by enacting clear-cut regulations for cryptocurrencies, the Nickel Digital spokesperson told Cointelegraph:Earlier in July, authorities in Germany passed a landmark ruling allowing institutional funds to allocate up to 20% of their assets under management to cryptocurrencies. This move came despite warnings by Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority about the dangers of speculative investments.The new law in Germany could potentially see up to $415 billion worth of investments flowing into the crypto space. Germany’s Fund Allocation Act is also on top of previous rulings that put security tokens on equal footing as other regulated investment vehicles in the country.Dismissing concerns regarding regulatory scrutiny having any negative impact on institutional crypto involvement, DiPasquale told Cointelegraph, “Regulatory fears are always present in the crypto space, but there is a drive towards compliance, which is likely to result in a more lenient attitude in the future.”If the current crypto downturn offers a premium investment opportunity for hedge funds and other institutional investors, such a strategy most likely relies on the expectation of a market bounce in the future. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Sirer has predicted that sideways accumulation will dominate the crypto price action during the summer months.Indeed, since dipping by over 50%, Bitcoin has been range-bound between the $32,000 and the $36,000 price marks. Bitcoin’s lack of a significant breakout either way has almost meant repeating mini-dips and pumps across the crypto market.However, Sirer said he expects a return to the upward parabolic price trajectory in Q4. According to the Avalanche founder, the expected resurgence should begin in October or November.“Bear market is actually great for getting work done. The transformation of finance isn’t going to stop because we hit a relative price correction,” Sirer added to Cointelegraph China. The Cornell University professor also stated that serious stakeholders are utilizing the current period as a time for consolidation and growth.Related: Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer ‘quite bullish’ on crypto market prospectsLike Sirer and Marshall Wace’s Rajpal, there is a growing belief that the crypto and blockchain space is on its way to upending the global financial system, hence the emerging interest from institutional entities. Even on the retail side, regulated institutions, such as banks, are also becoming keen on offering cryptocurrency-related services.Having seen millions of dollars flowing into the coffers of exchanges like Coinbase on a daily basis, firms like NYDIG say U.S. banks are keen to get in on the action and begin offering Bitcoin trading services to account holders. As such, the company has recently announced a raft of partnerships that will allow crypto trading right from customer bank accounts in America.BitBull’s DiPasquale also touched on the possibility of a bull market return in 2021 but offered a date closer to the winter period, adding, “We could see a return in 2021, yes, but parabolic gains may not be seen until December or early next year.” DiPasquale, however, predicted that Bitcoin will end the year trading above the $50,000 price mark."
211,"The9, a Chinese internet company listed on the Nasdaq, is moving forward with its cryptocurrency mining plans by signing a contract with a major Russian data center operator.The company announced Monday that it has signed a crypto-mining hosting agreement with Russian crypto mining services provider BitRiver through its fully-owned subsidiary, NBTC.As part of the agreement, BitRiver will reserve 15 megawatts (MW) of its electric capacity for The9's Bitcoin (BTC) mining machine deployment for an initial term of two years. After the contract expires, both parties have the right to automatically extend their cooperation for one more year, the announcement noted.As part of the agreement, The9 will place a batch of Bitcoin miners at BitRiver’s data center located in Russia’s Republic of Buryatia, a spokesperson for BitRiver told Cointelegraph. The9 is now expected to determine the exact number and type of mining devices that they plan to send to BitRiver’s data center. The facility has an initial total power capacity of 100 MW and is capable of hosting more than 33,000 mining devices.BitRiver is known as the largest crypto mining colocation services supplier in Russia, providing hosting services for large-scale crypto mining operations. The firm provides renewable energy sources for crypto mining, exclusively using surplus hydroelectric power to operate its data centers in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which are confirmed by certificates from the International Renewable Energy Certificate Standard Foundation.Related: China crypto ban a ‘huge opportunity for Canada,’ mining group head saysThe news comes as The9 continues to move into the crypto mining business after announcing plans to enter the industry earlier this year. The company said in January that it signed partnerships with several investors, including crypto mining giant Canaan.In June, The9 reached a definitive agreement to acquire Canadian crypto mining firm Montcrypto to build a 20 MW supply of electricity in Calgary. The company said that Montcrypto provides a “greener and more environmentally friendly power supply” to The9’s mining business with its carbon-neutral infrastructure."
212,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices steadied on Tuesday after closing the previous session at a 3.41% loss, supported by a weakening United States dollar sentiment ahead of a key U.S. inflation report due later on Tuesday.The spot BTC/USD exchange rate rose by a modest 1.31% to $33,096 after bottoming out on Monday at $32,996 on Coinbase. The CME Bitcoin Futures was up 1.64% from its previous session’s low of $32,600.Meanwhile, the USD index was down about 0.03% ahead of the London opening bell. The index represents the greenback’s strength against a basket of top foreign currencies.Bitcoin and the USD moved inversely during a week of key inflation reports and a crucial congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.On Tuesday, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) expects to post another significant spike in June, highlighting a run-up in inflation as the economy attempts to recover from the coronavirus pandemic slowdown. A Reuters poll of economists noted that the CPI might have increased by 0.5% since May and 4.9% from a year earlier.Many traders bet on Bitcoin against the prospects of higher inflation, partly due to popular narratives that project the flagship cryptocurrency as a hedge against central bank inflationary policies that hurt fiat currencies’ purchasing power.Inflation is killing your savings account.

Powering power. #BitcoinIn detail, the Federal Reserve has been running a $120-billion monthly asset purchase program since March 2020 while keeping its benchmark lending rate near zero. As a result, the U.S. central bank’s policies have doubled the size of its balance sheet to more than $8 trillion. Meanwhile, the same period has witnessed Bitcoin spiking by up to 1,528% — from $3,858 to almost $65,000.The cryptocurrency had declined by more than half by the said mid-April peak but sustained its overall bullish bias by relentlessly holding $30,000 as its psychological price floor. The support came extremely handy following the previous two CPI reports showing that inflation jumped to 4.2% in April and 4.9% in May.“The uptick in the CPI readings is an indication that the economy has not healed completely from the pangs of the pandemic, and the crypto market is trailing the negative inflation figures,” Gustavo De La Torre, director of business development at N.exchange, told Cointelegraph. He added that lower Bitcoin prices combined with a mixed economic outlook would drive more investors to accumulate the cryptocurrency.“Should the buy-up intensify, a price push up to $40,000 for Bitcoin may be seen in the short term,” added De La Torre.Additionally, Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of CEX.IO, warned about the Fed’s potential hawkish reaction to further inflation hikes, noting that it might prompt the central bank to unwind its bond-buying program and cut interest rates earlier than expected.“As things stand, the Federal Reserve has increased the size of its balance sheet from early 2020 to more than $8 trillion — a substantial rise,” Anissimov said, adding that lower crypto prices would keep serving as the right hedge against inflationary fears for the time being. He further noted:On-chain indicators continued to point toward an ongoing Bitcoin accumulation. As of the last week’s close, as per Glassnode’s data, entities with little history of selling continued piling up Bitcoin from weaker hands, while net exchange flows dipped into negative territory, suggesting that traders have been withdrawing their Bitcoin from trading platforms to hold.“Retail has been buying heavily for weeks now, but we finally got the uptick in whales that we were waiting for,” noted Will Clemente III, an independent market analyst.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

213,"The number of Bitcoin (BTC) held on centralized exchanges has consistently fallen since late May, with roughly 2,000 BTC (worth roughly $66 million at current prices) flowing out of exchanges daily.Glassnode’s Monday “The Week On-Chain” report found that Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchanges have fallen back to levels not seen since April, the month that saw BTC blast to its all-time high of roughly $65,000.The researchers noted that during the bull run leading up to this peak, relentless depletion of exchange coin reserves was a key theme. Glassnode concludes that much of this BTC went to the Grayscale GBTC Trust or was accumulated by institutions, driving “a persistent net outflow from exchanges.”However, when Bitcoin prices slumped in May, this trend reversed as coins were sent to exchanges for liquidation. Now, the net transfer volume has moved back into negative territory again as outflows increase.The report also noted that the proportion of on-chain transaction fees represented by exchange deposits declined to 14% dominance this past week, following a brief peak to around 17% in May.On-chain fees associated with withdrawals saw a notable bounce from 3.7% up to 5.4% this month, suggesting an increasing preference for accumulation over sales, it added.Related: Bitcoin price falls under $33K, but on-chain data hints at BTC accumulationThe fall in exchange reserves appears to have coincided with an uptick in capital flows to decentralized finance protocols over the past fortnight.According to Defi Llama, the total value locked has increased by 21% since June 26 as it climbed from $92 billion to $111 billion."
214,"Bitcoin (BTC) might be struggling to break the $36,000 resistance for the past three weeks, but bulls now have one less thing to worry about: cascading futures contracts liquidations.One might be under the impression that a $1 billion liquidation is usual for Bitcoin. Still, traders tend to remember the most recent exaggerated movements more than any other price shifts, especially when the price crashes and people lose money.This negativity bias means that even when various price impacts with equal intensity occur, the unpleasant emotions and events have a more significant effect on a trader's psychological state.For example, multiple studies show that winning $500 from playing the lottery is two to three times less 'impactful' than losing the same amount from the gambler's personal wallet.Currently, we are six and a half months into 2021 and there have been only 7 times where a $1 billion or larger long contract liquidation has occurred. So, rather than being the norm, these are very unusual situations that can only take place when traders are using excessive leverage.More importantly, there hasn't been a $1 billion short-seller liquidation even when Bitcoin rallied 19.4% on Feb. 8. These liquidations just show how leverage longs tend to be more reckless, leaving less margin on derivatives exchanges.While retail traders use high leverage and eventually fall victim to liquidations, more intuitive traders that bet on a price drop are likely fully hedged and doing 'cash and carry' trades.This is one of the three reasons why $1 billion futures liquidation should not be a concern right now.The quarterly futures contracts usually do not trade at par with regular spot exchanges prices. Usually, there is a premium when the market is neutral or bullish and it ranges from 5% to 15% annualized.This rate (known as the basis) is often comparable to the stablecoin lending rate because the decision to postpone settlement means sellers demand a higher price, and this causes the price difference.This situation creates room for arbitrage desks and whales to buy Bitcoin at regular spot exchanges and simultaneously short the futures to collect the futures contract premium.Although these traders will be displayed as 'short interest', they are effectively neutral. Thus, the result will be independent of the market moving up or down.Traders were ultra bullish on Bitcoin price as it rallied to a $65,800 high, but this sentiment flipped to bearish after the brutal long contracts liquidations between May 11 and May 23 as BTC crashed 53% from $58,500 to $31,000.Looking at the perpetual contracts (inverse swaps) funding rate is a good way to measure investors' sentiment. Whenever longs are the ones demanding more leverage, the indicator will become positive.Since May 20, there hasn't been a single day where the 8-hour funding rate was higher than 0.05%. This evidence indicates that buyers are unwilling to use high leverage, and without it, it's harder to create $1 billion or higher liquidations.Every futures contract needs a buyer and seller of the exact same size, and the open interest measures the aggregate notional in U.S. dollars. This means that as Bitcoin price moves down, so does the indicator.The above chart shows how the futures open interest surpassed $20 billion by mid-March. During that period, a $1 billion liquidation represented a mere 5% of the outstanding total.Considering the current $11.8 billion open interest, the same $1 billion amount would represent 8.5% of the aggregate number of contracts.In a nutshell, it is becoming much more difficult for cascading liquidations to take place because buyers are not using excessive leverage, and sellers appear to be fully hedged. Unless these indicators shift significantly, bulls can remain in peace.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

215,"As the pressures placed on the market by China’s cryptocurrency crackdown begin to subside and the Bitcoin (BTC) hashrate starts to show signs of recovery, traders are now focused on how the price will be affected by this week's unlocking of more than $550 million worth of Grayscale's GBTC shares.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the early morning downtrend in BTC on July 12 continued into the afternoon as the price of BTC dropped below the $33,000 support level after bears took control of the market.Grayscale attracted further attention on Monday after various media reported that the firm has publicly filed three Form 10 registration statements with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).This brings the number of publicly reported trusts managed by Grayscale to five, with the trusts for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Litecoin (LTC) joining the previously filed trusts for Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).China’s crackdown on Bitcoin mining resulted in a 55% decline in the network hashrate as BTC mines were shut down across the country and operations moved overseas.According to a recent report from Glassnode, roughly 29% of the lost hashpower has now come back online as a result of Chinese miners successfully relocating hardware while “previously obsolete hardware has been dusted off and found a new lease on life.”After nearly a month of selling from miners, the Miner Net Position Change metric now shows that they are back in accumulation mode indicating that “the sell-side pressure coming from offline miners is more than offset by accumulation by the operational miners.”Further evidence for a decrease in selling can be found in the exchange flow data for BTC, which has seen a larger amount of BTC withdrawn from exchanges than deposited over the past two weeks.As a result of the increased outflows, the amount of Bitcoin reserves held across all exchanges fell by more than 16,100 BTC between June 28 and July 11.From a macro perspective, many interpret this as a bullish development for Bitcoin as token holders appear to be withdrawing BTC to put into long-term storage as the market awaits the next significant move higher.Related: Bitcoin dips below $33K as shorts spike, trader warns of 'violent' BTC price squeezeAltcoins as a whole fell under pressure on Monday as the pullback in BTC led to weakness across the market.As the sell-off intensified into the afternoon the price of Ether (ETH) fell to the $2,000 support level after traders rushed for the exits.While the majority of the market was in the red for the day, there were several projects that managed to rise above the noise and post gains on July 12, with Metal (MTL) putting up a gain of 18% while Revain (REV), Stratis (STRAX) and Injective Protocol (INJ) gained 12%The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.354 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 45.5%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

216,"Art and jewelry brokerage Sotheby’s put a 101 carat diamond up for auction, fetching over $10 million in crypto for the rock on Friday. The diamond “sold for $12.3 million to an anonymous buyer last Friday at Sotheby’s Hong Kong,” MarketWatch reported on Monday. “It’s the most expensive gem ever purchased with cryptocurrency, according to Sotheby’s,” MarketWatch added.News of the crypto-friendly diamond auction surfaced in the second half of June, with estimates forecasting the diamond to hit prices somewhere in the ballpark of $15 million. Called The Key 10138, the diamond’s name reportedly pays homage to the crypto industry lingo private keys, which give access to each crypto owner's holdings.Anonymity and pseudonymity are not uncommon in the crypto industry. Crypto traders and social media personalities often comment on Twitter via pseudonymous profiles. Even the creator (or creators) of Bitcoin (BTC), the asset that started the whole crypto industry, remained pseudonymous under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.It’s fitting for the crypto industry that the diamond auction would yield an anonymous buyer paying in crypto. Results of the auction did not include which digital asset the buyer put up as payment, according to MarketWatch. Buyers had the option to wager their offers for the diamond in Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), or regional currencies, or fiat currencies.Related: Bitcoin price will see breakout ‘during this week’ says trader with $38K targetOn Friday, Bitcoin’s price approximately traded between $32,670 and $34,170, based on Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin price index. Ethereum traded roughly between $2,070 and $2,180 on that day. Using a price of $33,000 per Bitcoin, the buyer would have paid about 372 BTC for the diamond. If paying in ETH, the rock would have cost about 5,857 ETH, assuming a price of $2,100 for each ETH coin. The actual totals were not shared, however, so the aforementioned simply serves as a logical benchmark of potential based on price action from Friday."
217,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) roof has been shifting lower in the past few days, which is a negative sign because it shows that bears are selling on every minor rally. Bitcoin’s weakness is affecting the major altcoins as most are gradually drifting lower.Joel Kruger, a Forex strategist at LMAX, recently said:However, Bitcoin’s fundamentals seem to be improving. The network hashrate had taken a big knock due to China's recent crackdown on miners, but it is gradually coming back on track according to data from various on-chain sources. This shows how the network has balanced itself without the need for assistance from any external agency.Will Bitcoin’s price follow the hashrate higher or will negative sentiment prevail? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin has been struggling to rise above the 20-day exponential moving average ($34,245). This is a negative sign as it shows that bears are aggressively defending this resistance. The price has turned down from the 20-day EMA today and the bears will now try to pull the price down to $31,000.The 20-day EMA has started to turn down again and the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped below 45, indicating that bears are attempting to gain the upper hand. A break and close below $31,000 will be the first sign of the possible resumption of the downtrend.The selling could intensify further if the $28,000 support cracks. That could result in long liquidation, which may pull the price down to $20,000.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate accumulation by the bulls. A break above the 50-day simple moving average ($35,594) and the $36,670 resistance zone will signal strength.The buyers have been struggling to push Ether (ETH) above the 20-day EMA ($2,17) for the past three days, which indicates stiff resistance from the bears at this level.The sellers are currently attempting to sink the ETH/USDT pair below the psychological support at $2,000. If they manage to do that, the pair may drop to $1,728.74. A break below this support could signal the resumption of the downtrend.Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that bulls are attempting to make a comeback. The buyers will then try to thrust the price above the 50-day SMA ($2,339).This level may act as a stiff resistance but if the pair climbs above it, the next stop could be the downtrend line.Binance Coin (BNB) has been trading between the moving averages for the past five days. This tight consolidation suggests that bulls are buying on dips to the 20-day EMA ($313) and bears are defending the 50-day SMA ($333).However, this tight-range trading is unlikely to continue for long. If bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA, the BNB/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally toward $379.58. If bulls clear this hurdle, the up-move could reach $433.On the other hand, if bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could slide to the $276.40 to $264.26 support zone. A break below this zone could pull the price down to the critical support at $211.70.Cardano (ADA) has been trading between the 20-day EMA ($1.37) and the horizontal support at $1.28 for the past three days. This tight consolidation suggests that both the bulls and the bears are waiting for a clear direction before placing large bets.Both moving averages are nearly flat and the RSI is above 44, indicating an equilibrium between buyers and sellers. This advantage will tilt in favor of the bears if the $1.28 support gives way. That will clear the path for a possible drop to $1.20 and then $1.10.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off $1.28, the bulls will try to drive the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($1.47) and then to the downtrend line. A break above this resistance will be the first sign that the correction may be over.Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to stay above the $0.21 support, which suggests a lack of buying as traders are not confident of a rally. This increases the possibility of a break below $0.21.If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the next important level at $0.15. A break below this support could result in panic selling. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 38 indicate that bears are in control.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the current level, the bulls will try to propel the pair above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair may recover to the 50-day SMA ($0.28) and then to the neckline.XRP has been trading between the 20-day EMA ($0.67) and the horizontal support at $0.59. This suggests that bears are selling on minor rallies to the 20-day EMA.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If bears sink and sustain the price below $0.59, the XRP/USDT pair could retest the critical support at $0.50.This is an important level for the bulls because if it cracks, the pair could start the next leg of the downtrend. To negate this possibility, the bulls will have to push the price above the 20-day EMA and the horizontal resistance at $0.75.Polkadot’s (DOT) range has shrunk further and the price is stuck between $14.50 and $16.93. The negative sign is that the price has been trading near the support of this consolidation, indicating that bulls are in no hurry to buy at the current levels.The 20-day EMA ($16.37) is sloping down marginally and the RSI is in the negative zone, suggesting that bears have the upper hand. If bears sink the price below $14.50, the DOT/USDT pair could drop to $13.This is an important support to watch out for because if it gives way, the pair could start the next leg of the downtrend. On the contrary, if the price rebounds off $14.50, the bulls will again try to clear the hurdle at $16.93. If they succeed, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($19.59).Uniswap (UNI) has been trading between the moving averages. The bulls are buying on dips to the 20-day EMA ($20.21) but have not been able to clear the hurdle at the 50-day SMA ($22.07). This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. A breakout and close above the 50-day SMA will tilt this advantage in favor of the bulls. That could clear the path for an up-move to $25 and then $27.On the other hand, if the price slips and closes below the 20-day EMA, it will signal advantage to the bears. The UNI/USDT pair could then drop to the next support at $16.93. If this support also cracks, the decline may extend to $15.Related: Synthetix hits one-month high as SNX rallies 25% ahead of layer 2 exchange launchBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been stuck between the 20-day EMA ($512) and the horizontal support at $475 for the past four days. This suggests that bears are defending the 20-day EMA aggressively.The 20-day EMA continues to slope down gradually and the RSI is below 41, indicating that bears have the upper hand. If bears sink the price below $475.69, the short-term bulls may dump their positions. That could pull the price down to $428.If this support also cracks, the BCH/USDT pair may drop to the critical support at $370. Alternatively, if the price rebounds off $475.69, the bulls will try to propel the pair above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair may rise to $538.11.A breakout and close above this resistance will be the first sign of strength. The pair could then move up to the 50-day SMA ($578) and later to $650.Litecoin (LTC) has been facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($139) for the past few days but the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the bears to sustain the price below the critical support at $118.This suggests that selling dries up at lower levels. The RSI has been trying to rise above 46 and if that happens, the bullish momentum could pick up. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA.If they succeed, the LTC/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($156) followed by a rally to $180. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level, the pair could drop to $118. A breakdown and close below this support could signal the resumption of the next leg of the downtrend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

218,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell back below $33,000 support on Monday, as a familiar cocktail of low volumes and mounting shorts pressured price action. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as it hit local lows of $32,880 on Bitstamp. Just like last week, a build-up of short positions on major exchange Bitfinex cost Bitcoin its range low, sending it back into its last zone of support before a $30,000 retest.BTC/USD lost approximately 2.9% on the day, at the time of writing, fluctuating around the $33,000 mark but staving off losses. Earlier, analysts had been more upbeat about the short-term prospects, forecasting an upside bounce this week that could see a target of $38,000.“I’m getting to the stage that I’m quite done with this range on Bitcoin,” an understandably weary Michaël van de Poppe summarized to Twitter followers.Those looking for more excitement are not being left out this week, even as ranging behavior continues.Related: Countdown to Grayscale’s big BTC unlock: 5 things to watch in Bitcoin this weekThe inspiration this time comes courtesy of well-known trader John Wick, who, in a series of tweets on Monday, eyed a rare signal in Bitcoin that historically demands a snap price move.“We have now entered a zone of coiled up volatility indicated by the yellow shading,” he commented alongside a chart describing an event called a “squeeze.”Squeezes are not an everyday occurrence. The previous two events involved a trip from $9,100 to recent all-time highs at $64,500, along with the subsequent correction to $30,000, Wick said.While the exact timing and nature of the next squeeze, or even its direction, remain unknown, Wick’s bias is to the upside. Contributing to his belief are both recent accumulation of BTC and the strength of $30,000 support. "
219,"Fidelity Digital, the crypto arm of the global asset management giant Fidelity Investments Inc., will reportedly hire more people for its expanding cryptocurrency business.According to Bloomberg on Monday, the company is planning to increase its staff size by about 70% to handle the growing patronage from big-money crypto investors.The increased workforce, numbering at least 100, will reportedly be deployed to locations in Salt Lake City, Boston and Dublin.As part of the staff headcount expansion, Fidelity Digital president Tom Jessop said the company is looking to offer exposure to other cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin (BTC), telling Bloomberg: “We’ve seen more interest in Ether, so we want to be ahead of that demand.”Indeed, institutional interest in Ether (ETH) has been growing since the start of the year with investment inflows for ETH-based products even outpacing Bitcoin’s on some occasions.Apart from diversifying into crypto investment and custody catalog, the recruits will also reportedly help the company extend its operating time in an attempt to offer full-time services “for most of the week.”Unlike the legacy trading arena, the crypto market operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For Jessop, Fidelity Digital needs to upscale its operations to mirror this operating paradigm.Related: Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer ‘quite bullish’ on crypto market prospectsJessop also offered a unique perspective to view the evolution of institutional crypto interest beyond hedge funds and family offices. According to the Fidelity Digital chief, retirement advisors and companies are now looking for some form of exposure to crypto assets.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Avalanche blockchain founder and Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer revealed that retirement funds were looking to become the next big-money players in the crypto space.Even the current crypto market downturn has done little to dampen the enthusiasm among institutional investors.

221,"Bitcoin (BTC) closed beneath a key moving average for the eighth week in a row this weekend, but one analyst is betting on an imminent breakout.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked Bitcoin as it reversed weekend gains on Monday after a disappointing weekly close.The largest cryptocurrency had maintained its familiar trading range with $33,000 as support through Saturday and Sunday, but the new week dampened momentum.For popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital, unless progress can be made, Bitcoin bulls may not have long to last before fresh losses hit.“The blue 50-week EMA is still holding as support,” he summarized in a series of tweets.Others were more upbeat. In his latest video update, fellow trader Michaël van de Poppe went as far as to call a BTC price breakout within days.“I believe that Bitcoin is going to make a breakout to the upside,” he forecast.A look at buy and sell levels at major exchange Binance showed resistance forming at $35,000, with $30,000 remaining in place as overall support.Van de Poppe added that this movement might be good for altcoins, which could start capitalizing on bullish sentiment. He had previously argued that altcoins would outperform the speed of Bitcoin’s gains in the coming months.“I think the altcoins are close to a bottom too,” he said on Friday. Related: Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, LUNA, ATOM, CAKE, FTTMost altcoins saw flat performance on the day, little changed over the past 24 hours.With little by way of strong sentiment in either direction, as Cointelegraph reported, concerns remain that external factors may unduly influence price action across cryptocurrencies.This comes in the form of the Grayscale unlocking series, which involves around 42,000 BTC over the month of July."

223,"Ukrainian authorities have raided an allegedly illicit crypto farm in the country. According to an official announcement from the Security Service of Ukraine, the facility was located on the former premises of JSC Vinnytsiaoblenergo, an electricity supply company. The illegal crypto miners concealed their activities by manipulating electricity meters to steal electricity from JSC Vinnytsiaoblenergo.Described as the largest underground mining operation discovered by the Ukrainian police, the farm housed nearly 5,000 computer equipment units, including 3,800 PlayStation 4 consoles, over 500 graphics cards, 50 processing units, notebooks, phones and flash drives.The SBU estimated the state’s monthly losses due to electricity theft — which had the potential to cause electricity shortages for the entire city of Vinnytsa — to range between $186,200 and $259,300.Related: Gamers and miners spar over scarce top hardwareSeveral estimates show that Sony’s last-gen gaming console, PlayStation 4, is not the ideal rig to mine cryptocurrency.

225,"American megabank JPMorgan has continued criticizing El Salvador’s declaration of Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender, warning of the potential risks for both the country and the cryptocurrency.A JPMorgan expert group led by economist Steven Palacio released a report suggesting that El Salvador adopting BTC as legal tender could put a strain on the Bitcoin network, Bloomberg reported Sunday.The experts said that Bitcoin is highly illiquid, noting that most Bitcoin trading volumes are internalized by major exchanges, with more than 90% of Bitcoin not changing hands in more than a year.The use of Bitcoin as legal tender in a country like El Salvador will potentially put a “significant limitation” on Bitcoin’s capability to serve as a medium of exchange, JPMorgan experts noted, pointing to the cryptocurrency’s illiquidity and trading nature.“Daily payment activity in El Salvador would represent 4% of recent on-chain transaction volume and more than 1% of the total value of tokens which have been transferred between wallets in the past year,” they said.The JPMorgan experts also noted other challenges associated with El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender, including the potential impact on the monetary system alongside official dollarization. A continuous imbalance of demand for conversions of Bitcoin and the United States dollar could “cannibalize onshore dollar liquidity” and eventually introduce fiscal and balance of payments risk, the report added.Related: UN commission serves new warning against BTC adoption in El SalvadorAs previously reported, El Salvador’s parliament passed a bill to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender in early June, with President Nayib Bukele stating that accepting Bitcoin would be mandatory for all businesses.

JPMorgan analysts suggested that El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption could jeopardize IMF negotiations."
226,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week in familiar territory — crucial support is back, but bulls have not yet got their breakout. Could that soon change?After reclaiming $33,000 on Friday, BTC/USD has held on to the trading corridor it had been in before last week’s brief volatility. That involved a dip to $32,000 on the back of sudden short positions accumulating on exchange Bitfinex.The impact was only temporary, however, and the weekend saw highs of $34,600 on Bitstamp.Cointelegraph presents five factors to consider when eyeing what Bitcoin might do next.With stocks going upward as usual, there seems to be little in terms of friction that could cause problems for cryptocurrency gains.While analysts are increasingly warning about a comedown in the future, the mood in equities remains firmly buoyant this week.“There does seem to be a complacency that Goldilocks is not only alive and well, but that it’s getting stronger by the day,” Simon Ballard, chief economist at First Abu Dhabi Bank, told Bloomberg.The United States dollar, however, could provide more clues.Taking a look at the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), which measures USD strength against a basket of 20 trading partner currencies, the picture shows some familiar resistance is back in play.Late last week, one analyst argued that DXY needed to rise from its current 92.2 to around 94 in order to see major resistance kick in, which would boost Bitcoin.On Monday, however, DXY is still recovering from losses it incurred at the end of the week, also battling a zone that has kept it in check in the past.Bitcoin’s inverse correlation to DXY has also been placed under the microscope recently, as BTC increasingly forges its own path within the macro environment.Looking at the spot market, traders are bullish at the prospect of $33,000 returning and enduring after a brief bearish episode last week.After “reaffirming” the level, trader and analyst Rekt Capital explained on Sunday that BTC/USD is back at the lower end of an established range.“BTC is breaking back above the orange trendline,” he said in a subsequent update alongside a chart showing the current landscape. Monday has continued the trend, with Bitcoin trading at around $34,350 at the time of writing.“Bitcoin is trying to rally and close an 8th week in a row above 34k with a long wick down. Lots of demand still,” fellow trader Scott Melker added.Last week, targets of up to $39,000 were in for Bitcoin should bulls manage to attack $35,500 resistance and continue, something that in the event failed to occur.If last week’s price action disappointed, under the hood, Bitcoin has been working on a more important turnaround.Data from monitoring resources on Monday shows that both network difficulty and the hash rate are stabilizing and that, therefore, the worst of the recent mining turbulence could be firmly over.After its record drop earlier in July, difficulty was previously on track to beat even its latest performance and shed another 28% or more.In the intervening period, however, a recovery has started to take place. Now, the next difficulty adjustment should only see a 10% drop should price action remain near current levels.“Blocks coming in at a rapid phase — next difficulty adjustment is now estimated at ~ -7.5% but it seems to me like hash rate is coming back pretty quickly at the moment,” angel investor Klaus Lovgreen summarized on the day.The changes are testament to the power of the Bitcoin network to balance itself without any external assistance — regardless of the circumstances, difficulty adjusts to take into account any given eventuality.The estimated hash rate remains only modestly above its recent lows of 83 exahashes per second (EH/s), but even here, stability and a slow return to the norm are visible.As Cointelegraph reported, both metrics are expected to make fresh gains as mining power returns to Bitcoin after relocating out of China. The timeframe for this to happen, by contrast, is anyone’s guess.An event that is on every Bitcoin market participant’s radar this month is the multiple unlockings of BTC at institutional giant Grayscale.As Cointelegraph explained, the Grayscale Bitcoin Fund (GBTC) is due to release in excess of 40,000 BTC in the coming weeks, this having been subject to a six-month lock-up period.Opinions differ about its market impact. Some are concerned that selling pressure will increase (only to then become practically zero after the unlockings are over), while others argue that spot markets will be broadly unaffected.Sunday, July 18, is of particular interest, with that day’s unlocking worth just over 16,000 BTC.“When GBTC shares unlock and get sold, the GBTC Premium drops (share price drops relative to the BTC in the trust),” statistician Willy Woo commented last week.In need of some reliable “hopium” for the week ahead? Bitcoin market analytics has the answer.On Monday, attention was turning to a nifty indicator from on-chain data service CryptoQuant, which has historically caught every major BTC price run in the past two years.Dubbed the Taker Buy Sell Volume/Ratio, it tracks exchange data to produce as a guide for when to hodl and when is a good opportunity to take profit during a local market cycle.Right now, the Ratio appears to be forecasting another BTC/USD surge, leading to a classic “take profit” point.Analyst Cole Garner has even highlighted what to expect should history repeat itself. He noted, however, that the trigger phase — where the Ratio touches the upper green channel — has “not happened yet.”“Buy signal incoming,” he nonetheless commented.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

227,"Bitcoin (BTC) price is still range-bound and traders are searching for signs that may provide insight about the next directional move. Philip Swift, the creator of analytics resource LookIntoBitcoin, pointed out on July 9 that the Puell Multiple rebounded “out of the green zone of this week” only for the fifth time in history. Swift said if the indicator continues to move up, Bitcoin’s price may follow it higher.Another positive outlook for Bitcoin came from Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer at Moskovski Capital, who highlighted that Bitcoin’s price was trading about 59% below the target price projected by the stock-to-flow model, which is the largest negative deflection in history. Moskovski said this could be a “great buying opportunity” for traders who believe in the model.In other news, Capital International, a financial services company, has purchased 953,242 shares of MicroStrategy stock in the second quarter of 2021, according to the business intelligence firm’s filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Due to its huge Bitcoin holding, MicroStrategy’s stock price largely follows Bitcoin’s trajectory. Therefore, the purchase by Capital International indicates that institutional investors may have started positioning for a bullish move in Bitcoin.However, not everyone is so bullish. Guggenheim executive Scott Minerd has an extremely bearish view on Bitcoin because he anticipates a drop to $10,000.Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies and spot the critical levels that may signal the start of a strong relief rally.Bitcoin has been trading in a tight range between $31,000 and $36,670 for the past few days, which suggests that traders are undecided about the next directional move. Usually, the breakout from a tight range results in a sharp move.Both moving averages are gradually flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) has been trading close to the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. If bulls push the price above $36,670, it will be the first sign of strength.The BTC/USDT pair could then rally to $41,330 and then to $42,451.67 where the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance. A breakout of this resistance will indicate the possible start of a new uptrend.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance at $36,670, the bears will try to pull the pair down to $31,000 and then to $28,000. A break below this support zone will increase the possibility of the resumption of the downtrend.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a descending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close below $32,268. If that happens, the possibility of a break below $31,000 increases.On the contrary, if bulls propel the price above the downtrend line, it will invalidate the bearish setup. The failure of a negative pattern is a bullish sign as it traps the aggressive bears who have sold in anticipation of a breakdown. The pair could then rise to $36,670.Terra protocol’s LUNA token had been trading inside the $7.96 to $3.91 range since the end of May. However, the bulls pushed the price above the resistance on the range on July 9, indicating that demand exceeds supply.The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI has risen close to the overbought zone, suggesting a change in trend.If bulls sustain the price above $7.96, the LUNA/USDT pair could start a new uptrend. The first target objective on the upside is the downtrend line where the bears will again try to stall the up-move.If the price turns down from the downtrend line but rebounds off the 20-day exponential moving average or $7.96, it will suggest the formation of a higher low. The buyers will then try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above the downtrend line.Contrary to this assumption, if bears pull the price back below $7.96, it will indicate a lack of demand at higher levels. A break below the moving averages will open the doors for a possible drop to $3.91.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory on the 4-hour chart, which shows that bulls have the upper hand.However, the bears have not yet given up as they are trying to stall the up-move close to $8.50. If bulls drive the price above $8.75, the pair could start a new uptrend that may reach $10 and then $12.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $7.46, the pair may drop to the 50-simple moving average.Cosmos (ATOM) has been trading between $17.56 and $8.51 for the past few days. The bulls pushed the price above the 50-day SMA ($12.66) on July 5, which was the first sign of strength.Thereafter, bears tried to trap the aggressive bulls and pull the price down but they could not break the 20-day EMA ($12.54) support. This suggests buying on dips.The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that the correction may have ended. The bulls will now try to push the price to the resistance of the range at $17.56 where the bears are likely to pose a stiff challenge.This bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from the current level and the bears sink the ATOM/USDT pair below $11.41. Such a move could open the doors for a drop to the critical support at $8.51.The price has been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few days. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will try to break the pair above the resistance line of the channel. If they succeed, the pair could pick up momentum and rally to $17.56.On the contrary, if bears sink the price below the moving averages, the pair could drop to the trendline of the channel. A break below this support will shift the advantage in favor of the bears.PancakeSwap (CAKE) has been sandwiched between the moving averages for the past five days. This consolidation shows that bears are defending the 50-day SMA ($15.67) while the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-day EMA ($14.55).However, this tight range trading is unlikely to continue for long and may result in a strong move within the next few days. The RSI has risen into the positive territory, indicating that bulls have a minor advantage.If buyers push and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA, the CAKE/USDT pair could rally to $18.62 and later to $21.52.Alternatively, if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA, the bears might pull the price down to $12.39. A break below this support could open the doors for a retest of the critical support at $10.The 4-hour chart shows that the price is rising inside an ascending channel. Both moving averages are sloping up gradually and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting that buyers have the upper hand.The bulls will now try to push the price into the upper half of the channel. If they succeed, the pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel near $17. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the trendline of the channel, it will suggest an end of the short-term up-move.Related: Key altcoin price metric flashed bullish ahead of Axie Infinity’s parabolic rallyFTX Token (FTT) broke above the downtrend line on July 6, suggesting that the correction may have ended. The bears tried to stall the recovery at the 50-day SMA ($30.26) on July 8 but could not sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($28.68).The price rebounded off the 20-day EMA on July 9 and the bulls are trying to push the FTT/USDT pair above the 50-day SMA. The 20-day EMA has started to turn up marginally and the RSI has risen into the positive zone, indicating that bulls are attempting to make a comeback.If buyers propel and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair could start a relief rally that may reach $34.73 and then $36.73.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and plummets below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. The pair could then drop to the next support at $25.22.The 4-hour chart shows that bulls have pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $30.50. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.If buyers sustain the price above $30.50, the pair could extend its relief rally to $33 and then to $34.73. This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $29.50. Such a move could pull the pair down to $28.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

228,"The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stretches the tax rules to fit its cryptocurrency agenda. At no time in tax history has pure creation been a taxable event. Yet, the IRS seeks to tax new tokens as income at the time they are created. This is an infringement on traditional tax principles and problematic for several reasons.In 2014, the IRS stated in an FAQ within IRS Notice 2014-21 that mining activities would result in taxable gross income. It is important to note that IRS notices are mere guidances and are not the law. The IRS concluded that mining is a trade or business and the fair market value of the mined coins are immediately taxed as ordinary income and subject to self-employment tax (an additional 15.3%). However, this guidance is limited to proof-of-work (PoW) miners and was only issued in 2014 — long before staking became mainstream. Its applicability to staking is especially misguided and inapplicable.Related: More IRS crypto reporting, more dangerA newly filed lawsuit now underway in federal court in Tennessee challenges the IRS’s taxation of staking rewards at their creation. Plaintiff Joshua Jarrett engaged in staking on the Tezos blockchain — staking his Tezos (XNZ) and contributing his computing power. New blocks were created on the Tezos blockchain and resulted in newly created Tezos for Jarrett. The IRS taxed Jarrett’s newly created tokens as taxable gross income based on the fair market value of the new Tezos tokens. Jarrett’s attorneys correctly pointed out that newly created property is not a taxable event. That is, new property (here, the newly created Tezos tokens) is only taxable when it is sold or exchanged. Jarrett has the support of the Proof of Stake Alliance, and the IRS has yet to answer the Jarrett complaint.In the history of the United States income tax, newly created property has never been taxable income. If a baker bakes a cake, it is not taxed when it comes out of the oven, it is taxed when sold at the bakery. When a farmer plants a new crop, it is not taxed when harvested, it is taxed when sold at the market. And when a painter paints a new portrait, it is not taxed when completed, it is taxed when sold at a gallery. The same holds true for newly created tokens. At creation, they are not taxed and should only be taxed when sold or exchanged.Cryptocurrency is new and there are a lot of evolving terminologies that go along with it. While calling newly created token blocks “rewards” is commonplace, it’s a misnomer and could be misleading. Calling something a reward suggests that someone else is paying for it and makes it sound a lot like taxable income. In actuality, no one is paying a new token to a staker — it’s new. Instead, staking produces truly new-created property.Related: More IRS summonses for crypto exchange account holdersSome suggest that new tokens are taxable (at creation) because there is an established market where value is immediately quantifiable. Said differently, they argue that the baker’s cake is not taxable upon creation because there is no established market price that determines what the cake is worth. It is true that Tezos tokens have an immediate market value, but even this fact should be put into context: Prices can vary across marketplaces and not all markets are accessible to everyone. But the existence of a market price is often true about new property — and not just for standardized or commodity products. If the standard is whether an identifiable market value exists, then other newly created property would indeed be taxable, including unique property. When Andy Warhol completed a painting, there was a market value for his artwork; it had value with every stroke of his brush. Yet, his paintings were not taxed upon creation. Newly created property — in any context — has never been taxable, not because its value might be uncertain, but because it isn’t income yet. Cryptocurrency should be treated the same.Other analogies to traditional tax principles are misplaced and they simply don't match up. For example, staking rewards are not like stock dividends. The IRS states in its Topic No. 404 Dividends that “dividends are distributions of property a corporation pays you if you own stock in that corporation.” Thus, dividends are a form of payment derived from a source — the corporation creates the dividend. Further, that dividend comes from the corporation’s profits and earnings. The same is not true for newly created tokens. With newly created property — like those through staking — there is no other person originating a payment and there is certainly no payment dependent on profits and earnings.Finally, the IRS position is impractical and overstates income. Staking rewards are continuously created and user participation is high. For both Cardano’s ADA and XNZ, over three-fourths of all users have staked coins. Across the spectrum of cryptocurrency staking, the pace of newly created tokens is staggering. In some instances, there are minute-by-minute and second-by-second creations of new tokens. This could account for hundreds of taxable events each year for a crypto taxpayer. Not to mention the burden of matching those hundreds of events to historical fair market spot prices in a volatile market. Such a requirement is unsustainable for both the taxpayer and the IRS. And ultimately, taxing new tokens as income results in overtaxation because the new tokens dilute the value of the tokens already in existence. This is the dilution problem and it means that if new tokens are taxed like income, stakers will pay tax on a demonstrably exaggerated statement of their economic gain.Related: Tax justice for crypto users: The immediate and compelling need for an amnesty programThe IRS’s fervor to tax cryptocurrencies promotes an inconsistent application of the tax laws. Cryptocurrency is property for tax purposes and the IRS cannot single it out for unfair treatment. It must be treated the same as other types of property (like the baker’s cake, the farmer’s crops, or the painter’s artwork). It should not matter that the property itself is cryptocurrency. The IRS appears blinded by its own enthusiasm, therefore we must advocate for tax fairness.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal advice.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
229,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price remained relatively flat over the weekend, inching closer to $34,000 on Sunday. Nevertheless, BTC/USD has tumbled by almost 50% from its all-time high, near $65,000 in mid-April. But the massive downside move has not deterred investors from betting on the digital asset’s long-term bullish outlook.According to one of the Glassnode metrics, dubbed as Liveliness, the Bitcoin market has been noticing a shift in long-term investors’ “macro hodling behavior.” Hodling represents crypto investors’ ritualized response to market downtrends, a meme-driven investment strategy that originated from a drunken forum post in 2013 and typo. Meanwhile, Liveliness is the ratio of cumulative coin days destroyed to the cumulative sum of all coin days ever accumulated by the network. It varies between zero and 1, with zero representing the highest proportion of dormant Bitcoin supply — i.e., hodling behavior. It shows that the global coin day accumulation has been outpacing coin days destroyed in on-chain activity.Nonetheless, a higher degree of distribution does not necessarily predict bearish cycles. For example, between November 2020 and April 2021, the Liveliness Ratio increased alongside the Bitcoin prices, suggesting that despite lower hodling behavior, the Bitcoin market did not enter a bearish phase. That could be due to massive spikes in trade volumes at the beginning of this year. In the first quarter, Bitcoin trading activity, on the whole, spiked to over $6 trillion, compared to $1.14 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to data obtained from Bitcoinity.Therefore, while the long-term holders started spending their Bitcoin between November 2020 and April 2021, higher trading volumes across all crypto exchanges showed that retail demand absorbed the selling pressure. But by April, as analyst Willy Woo noted, the selling had overrun the normal bull market buying pressure.Speculative participants started selling off their new coins to long-term holders, Woo wrote in a newsletter published on July 2 while referring to a so-called “Rick Astley” chart that studies Bitcoin flows between strong and weak hands. Excerpts:A spike in Bitcoin accumulation sentiment appeared as the cryptocurrency continues to maintain its bullish bias above a strongly held $30,000 support level. The BTC/USD exchange first dropped to the $30,000 level on May 19, during the overall cryptocurrency market crash. Since then, the pair has tested the price floor at least four times, only to witness a strong upside rebound later. That has made $30,000 a psychological support level, which, if broken to the downside, risks crashing Bitcoin’s price to as low as $20,000.Joel Kruger, a forex strategist at London-based investment management group LMAX, noted earlier this week that Bitcoin could revisit $20,000, for it remains under the pressure of global market sentiment. The analyst was referring to the latest meltdown in stock markets, on worries linked to the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19.“It would be foolish to rule out the possibility for a drop back below the June low, and we think there would be a risk in that scenario where the #Bitcoin price could revisit the old record high area around $20,000,” he added.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

230,"The date is set. July 11 is when soccer fans all over the world can, for a period of at least 90 minutes, forget all about what’s wrong with the outside world and finally get to witness who will be the winner of one of the most widely viewed sports in the world. England and Italy will compete for the honor to win the coveted UEFA European Football Championship 2020, or Euro 2020, trophy, which only comes around once every two years.Here is a little thought experiment for all the casual soccer fans out there: Try to think of every active soccer player you can think of. If the athletes in question are all relatively established and play for the top leagues in the world, then there is a high probability that they are representing their country in this year’s Euro 2020 championship.To really put things into perspective as to how big this event is, a recent study showed that a staggering 23.8 million viewers watched England's historic Euro 2020 victory against Denmark, with the last five minutes of the nail-biting semi-finals drawing a peak audience of over 25.7 million. In fact, the event’s viewership was only eclipsed in recent memory by the United Kingdom Prime Minister’s coronavirus announcement back in May, which was seen by nearly 27 million people across six different local news channels.A month of tense and exhilarating soccer has passed by and now it’s time for the two remaining top dogs, Italy and England, to fight it out at the historical Wembley Stadium.In the past, the tournament has seen many of Europe’s heavyweights slug it out. However, it bears mentioning that this time around, the Italian team, The Azzurri, has yet to lose a match in a whopping 33 international games, leaving them just a step away from carving their names in the records of soccer history.Their opponent, England, also known as the Three Lions, has also had strong gameplay through this year’s Euro 2020. They only allowed one goal during their entire campaign, which is quite an impressive feat, considering the level of competition they had to face — countries like Germany, the Czech Republic and Ukraine — to get to the finals. In all, the rosters for both teams look stacked and on paper, this clash should and probably will be a thriller.As one can expect, there is going to be a lot of betting happening for this game, with the oddsmakers giving the slight edge to England, which is arguably a surprise considering Italy’s unbeaten run. However, the importance of home-turf advantage can never be underestimated in soccer, no matter how many Italian’s may have crossed over to watch the finals in person.Lastly, with the rise of blockchain casinos and increased crypto adoption globally, a growing number of digital currency investors seem to have started making use of their crypto assets for gambling purposes. Therefore, it stands to reason that a lot of these folks may be betting on this game as well, either through crypto gambling platforms or even prediction markets.In recent years, a growing list of mainstream soccer clubs has continued to launch their very own digital currencies/fan tokens. And while the jury is still divided on the actual utility of these offerings, the fact of the matter remains that the soccer world has been quite sharp in recognizing the technological and monetary proposition put forth by crypto.In terms of betting, there are dozens of established gambling websites that accept a wide range of cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Tether (USDT), Ethereum (ETH) and more. There are many options out there and it’s just a matter of which platform a person decides to use in the end.It also goes without saying that several betting sites are currently offering their users numerous side-bets — another facet of online gambling that crypto enthusiasts can engage with. For example, the odds of Italy coming out of the tournament as the top-scoring team are currently at 10/11. Whereas for England, the figure stands substantially lower at 10/1.From a streaming standpoint, unfortunately, there aren’t a number of mainstream streaming services that accept cryptocurrency payments at the moment. That being said, betting portals have really upped their game over the last couple of years, with most platforms nowadays offering top-notch live streams that gamers can access at any time, given that they have sufficient tokens (which is usually not a lot) in their wallets.One way or the other, crypto seems to have made its way onto the soccer field, as was made evident recently when a fan literally ran onto the field wearing a t-shirt that read “WTF Coin” during Belgium’s clash with Finland. In fact, the event was able to garner so much traction that within hours of the invasion, almost every major sporting news outlet had covered the story, resulting in people discovering that WTF — Walnut Finance — is actually a yield farming project.Furthermore, the governing body overseeing Euro 2020, i.e. the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) recently entered into a five-year global partnership deal regarding blockchain technology with AntChain, a subsidiary of Ant Group which owns Alipay, one of the world’s largest digital payment platforms.As part of the deal, UEFA and AntChain will work closely to help utilize blockchain tech to not only promote the game but also to digitize the global soccer landscape. In this regard, it stands to reason that the two parties may potentially choose to explore the NFT sector because of the unique marketing/ownership opportunity presented by this exploding asset class.In the immediate future, however, the winner of this year’s Euro 2020 Golden Boot (i.e., the player that scores the most goals) will be awarded the “Alipay Trophy.” Not only that, but the top scorer’s records will also be stored on a blockchain system immutably.Regarding NFTs, it bears mentioning that over the past week, decentralized fantasy sports platform Rage Fan has been airdropping limited edition NFT mints to commemorate the Euro 2020 tournament. The last giveaway is set to commence on July 11 when England and Italy meet each other at Wembley.It is no secret that athletes from sporting professions across the board have continued to adopt crypto at a rapid rate. In terms of soccer alone, no one has done more to promote digital currencies than Andrés Iniesta, Carles Puyol and Gerard Piqué, three players who have all represented Spain and Barcelona during their careers.In fact, the triumvirate has been quite hands-on in its crypto outlook, with Iniesta and Puyol serving as the co-founders of Olyseum, a blockchain-powered social platform built to reward engagement, bringing fans and stars closer together. Meanwhile, Piqué has been vocal about his investments in the crypto-enabled fantasy soccer game Sorare. Even French superstar Antoine Griezmann is reported to have an investment in the platform.Netherland’s once-highly regarded wing/striking prospect Ryan Babel is also a Bitcoin proponent, highlighted by the fact that over the past year or so, he has repeatedly shared his optimism surrounding the crypto market via a number of tweets encouraging people, particularly his teammates, to buy BTC.This is definitely a question that begs to be answered.Here’s a quick add up of the transfer values for the (likely) starting eleven players of both teams that are participating in the final, just to see how much Bitcoin can be bought with the money.So as per data available, the valuation for England’s starting eleven comes to 570 million euros ($718.5 million), with the squad’s captain and star striker Harry Kane pitching it with a 120 million euro valuation. On the Italian side, the amount comes to 411 million euros ($488.7 million), with the outgoing A.C. Milan’s 22-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma accounting for 60 million euros of the total.This brings the total valuation of the two teams up to a staggering 981 million euros (almost $1.2 billion). At the time of writing, this comes to around 35,800 BTC that can be acquired with the aforementioned sum."
231,"Back in 2019, an estimated 99% of crypto-asset transfers took place on centralized exchanges (CEXs), according to the number that was used by main crypto critic Nouriel Roubini. CEXs are likely to remain a central fixture of the crypto trading landscape for the foreseeable future. CEXs are fast and convenient, but typically require traders to deposit funds in an account controlled by the exchange. Unfortunately, history illustrates that this loss of sovereignty over a user’s digital assets can be an extreme and costly compromise. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offer an intriguing alternative and are gaining momentum, but are still not yet ready for prime time. Therefore, there must be a way to bridge the gap between user sovereignty and exchange performance.Related: DeFi proved resilient during the March 2020 and May 2021 market crisesThe nightmare scenario for traders using CEXs is that they might fall victim to hacking or fraud and lose their deposited funds. Although seven years have passed since the collapse of Mt. Gox in 2014, its name still remains synonymous with the dangers of cryptocurrency fraud. Once the world's largest Bitcoin (BTC) exchange, it filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after Bitcoin of an estimated 650,000 customers went missing. The victims are still attempting to receive partial compensation from the insolvency process in 2021.Sadly, this form of counterparty risk remains a threat to this day. In April, the founder of Turkish exchange Thodex absconded with $2 billion of investor assets unaccounted for. A year before that, China’s FCoin and Australia’s ACX both closed without warning. Whether those failures were due to fraud, a hack, or problems with the business model, it doesn’t matter much to the investors left out of pocket. In an ideal world, the exchange operator (or a hacker who has compromised an exchange) should be denied the ability to move client funds discretionarily between accounts.Related: Trust is still a must in the trustless world of cryptocurrencyFor well-capitalized or well-connected traders, there are ways to mitigate these risks, but the solutions come with their own drawbacks.Credit is one way to avoid having to pre-fund an account. Yes, that is possible if you are willing to pay high fees to a broker or if you can get a credit line with a particular exchange by establishing yourself as a top customer. Either way, it is expensive (and in the latter case, slow), and only the biggest of spenders stand any chance of developing such a good relationship with multiple exchanges.Off-exchange settlement networks provide an alternative to loading funds directly onto exchanges. These intermediaries hold the trader’s funds and take on the counterparty risk for each exchange. In the current environment, such intermediaries provide a valuable service for institutions, but they still represent an added layer of expense. So much for frictionless trading.If the problem is the loss of asset sovereignty on CEXs, could DEXs be the solution? Yes and no. By using smart contracts and decentralized liquidity pools to enable asset swaps, DEXs remove intermediaries and enable traders to retain sovereignty over their assets. However, DEXs also involve heavy compromises, particularly for larger traders.On a DEX, instead of buyers and sellers being paired through a centralized matching engine, a smart contract performs the trades. Participants called “yield farmers” can lock their assets into a liquidity pool and earn yields in return. Each liquidity pool facilitates trading for a particular pair of assets, such as Bitcoin and Tether (USDT), for example. The smart contract will adjust yields according to the relative volume of assets in the pool, in order to attract more of the scarcer asset and maintain a healthy balance. At the same time, the transaction fee a trader pays will vary depending on the relative scarcity of the assets involved.Although innovative, this approach does not scale well. Depending on the size of the liquidity pool, large trades can immediately have a strong effect on trading fees. In addition, DEXs are highly susceptible to frontrunning. Frontrunners are traders (often bots) who scan for information that suggests a big trade is coming, then jump in with their own transaction to profit from the expected price move. Of course, these exploitative trades have their own effect on the market price, reducing the profit of the originally planned transaction. On CEXs, the risk is that if prefunding is conducted on-chain, third parties may be able to infer that a big trade is about to happen. However, these risks are greatly magnified when using a DEX.Due to the networking delay when processing transactions, pending transactions may circulate among validating nodes before they are finally committed to a block. Indeed, on smart-contract-based DEXs, bids are sent transparently, so a frontrunner simply needs to observe incoming bids and place their own bid with higher fees or with less networking delay in order to profit. Furthermore, as validators decide on the order of transactions for the blocks they produce, it could introduce another opportunity for manipulation.Thus, while DEXs are a tantalizing idea and present the opportunity to earn passive yield, they are currently not well suited to the needs of most traders.Related: Yield farming is a fad, but DeFi promises to change the way we interact with moneySo, can the interests of traders be better protected without the downsides of existing DEXs?One possible approach here would be to use blockchain as the source of trust and combine it with off-chain confidential computing hardware to handle order matching. For example, trusted execution environments (TEEs) can establish an isolated area within a computer processor, running separately from the standard operating system that is not accessible to the system admin.The matching engine and trade execution software for an exchange could be placed within a TEE, removing it from the control of the exchange owner. Each trader could then determine an allowance that the TEE could spend to settle trades on their behalf, eliminating the need for prefunding or intermediaries. In addition, as matching would be performed off-chain, the risk of frontrunning would also be reduced.Thinking more long term, a combination of other emerging techniques such as multi-party computation or zero-knowledge proofs might be able to be used to achieve similar results, but these approaches are currently less mature and would be difficult to implement in real world scenarios.The need for prefunding on cryptocurrency exchanges introduces problems and risks that pose a significant barrier to the adoption of digital assets. While DEXs offer an innovative alternative that leaves the trader in control of their funds, they also entail significant trade-offs. To drive the mainstream adoption of digital assets and gain a competitive advantage, cryptocurrency exchanges need to explore ways to preserve user sovereignty without compromising on performance.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

232,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors are known for being bullish, and even during 50% corrections like the current one, most analysts remain optimistic. One reason for investors' endless optimism and belief in infinite upside could be BTC's decreasing issuance and the 21 million coins fixed supply limit.However, not even the most accurate models, including the stock-to-flow (S2F) from analyst Plan B, can predict bear markets, crashes, or FOMO-induced (fear of missing out) pumps. Traders usually misinterpret these concepts as value and price expectations can be easily mistaken.Bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum, even if BTC maximalists think so. Therefore, its price action heavily depends on how many dollars, euros, and yuans are in circulation and interest rates, real estate, equities, and commodities. Even global economic growth and inflationary expectations impact the risk appetite for people, companies, and mutual funds.Regardless of what these valuation models predict, price is exclusively composed by the market participants at any given moment. Opposite to what one might expect, data from CryptoQuant shows only 2.5 million Bitcoin currently deposited on exchanges. Compare this to the 10.7 million that hasn't been moved in the last 12 months according to 'HODL wave' data, and we can say that long-term holders have no say in the price.As the difference between value (subjective) and price (historical and objective) becomes more evident, it is easier to understand why some investors expect $100,000 or higher targets for the end of 2021. However, to correctly interpret what odds are being placed for those prices, one needs to analyze the calls (buy) existing in the options markets.Although the call (buy) options vastly dominate compared to the protective puts, this is common for almost every asset class on longer-term expiries. However, a call option with a $50,000 strike should be more representative than a $200,000 one because their prices will be noticeably different.At the time of writing, a right to acquire (call option) Bitcoin for $50,000 on Dec. 31 is valued at $4,350. Meanwhile, the same instrument using a $200,000 strike price costs $415, which is roughly ten times lower.Cointelegraph previously explained how $100,000 to $300,000 strikes should not be taken as precise analysis-backed price estimates. Investors typically sell higher-strike calls while simultaneously buying the more costly call option with a lower strike.In short, assuming that investors are exclusively buying the ultra-bullish call options is naive and usually wrong. However, even the option strategies involving selling those options are generally neutral-to-bullish.According to the Black & Scholes model, the current $1,185 price for the $100,000 call option has a 13% mathematical probability. It is worth noting that this methodology considers the price exclusively on Dec. 31 at 8:00 am ET and does not count the $99,999 price as a success.Despite this, there is strong evidence that professional traders are still valuing the year-end $100,000 options. It might seem far-fetched right now, but Bitcoin's volatility opens room for surprise, especially considering that there's still half a year ahead.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

233,"Bitcoin (BTC) has never been as far below its target price as it is now, the stock-to-flow model shows this week.In a tweet on July 10, Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer at Moskovski Capital, showed stock-to-flow flagging a historic moment in Bitcoin's twelve-year lifetime.With BTC/USD showing few signs of a genuine bullish recovery, the pair has been drifting ever further from the price that the stock-to-flow price model calculates it should have.Stock-to-flow is arguably the most popular of the Bitcoin forecasters, and has historically tracked BTC price action with surprising accuracy, taking every anomaly into account to remain valid.As Cointelegraph reported, however, current behavior is giving stock-to-flow a run for its money, and as of now, its target price comparatively has never been so far from reality.""Negative Stock-To-Flow deflection is the highest it's ever been in the whole Bitcoin history,"" Moskovski commented.According to the Stock-to-Flow Multiple, BTC/USD should be trading at $82,703 on Saturday. At the time of writing, the actual spot price was $33,850 — 59% lower.The model's creator, PlanB, has stuck by a seriously bullish view on Bitcoin for 2021, his latest price prediction calling for $135,000 by December as a ""worst-case scenario.""The analyst is currently off the grid and not commenting on events, promising to return in August, which has a minimum price target of around $47,000.PlanB has never ruled out stock-to-flow becoming invalidated at any point, and this could become a reality if the most bearish scenarios become reality.Related: PlanB feeling ‘uneasy’ as 41% of his followers tip $100K BTC won’t happen this yearAmong them is a $10,000 warning from Scott Minerd, the Guggenheim executive who this week claimed there was not ""any reason"" to buy Bitcoin under current conditions.Other data points to an extended recovery period for Bitcoin fundamentals, while December could bring selling pressure once more, in line with historical precedent.

234,"As Bitcoin (BTC) struggles around the $32,700 mark after the July 8 price drop, another major event looms over the flagship cryptocurrency in July, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) unlock.A total of nearly 40,000 BTC will be unlocked in July, amounting to nearly $1.5 billion in notional value. The biggest of these unlocks will be on July 18 when 16,240 BTC will be available due to the release of the six-month lock-in period for GBTC shares. The tranche of shares consists of positions locked in Q1 2021 with a notional value of around $530 million, making this the largest GBTC unlocking event to date.Grayscale Investments is one of the largest institutional fund managers for digital currencies that allow institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price action through the GBTC shares. At the time of writing, the GBTC fund holds 654,600 BTC tokens worth more than $21.56 billion. This amounts to 3.11% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply of 21 million tokens, making the fund the top destination for institutional investors to have exposure to BTC through a traditional exchange product. The GBTC shares are available on OTCQX, an over-the-counter platform owned by OTC Markets Group.The GBTC share is currently trading in the $27 range, which is over 52% down from its all-time high of $58.22 on Feb. 19. The share tracks Bitcoin’s market price excluding any applicable fees and expenses. With a minimum capital requirement for an investment of $50,000, the shares are more suited for institutional investors that have access to such large sums of capital.According to JPMorgan analysts, the unlocking event could pose a “downside risk” on BTC’s spot market in the ongoing bearish stint that BTC is currently witnessing. They further stated, “Selling of GBTC shares exiting the six-month lockup period during June and July has emerged as an additional headwind for bitcoin.”However, a recent report from cryptocurrency exchange Kraken states that “market structure suggests that the unlock will not weigh materially on BTC spot markets anytime soon, if at all, like some have claimed.” Citing filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Kraken claims that most of the shares to be unlocked are owned by large institutions that purchased the GBTC shares with BTC to utilize the premium-to-net-asset value (NAV) that the shares traded at then.Furthermore, it is likely that these investors shorted Bitcoin in futures markets to minimize any impact due to negative price movements in the BTC spot markets. Cointelegraph discussed the unlocking event with Shane Ai, who is responsible for product research and development of crypto derivatives at Bybit — a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. He explained:The GBTC premium is the difference between the value of the assets — i.e., Bitcoin — held by the trust in comparison with the market price of these holdings. This premium exists due to the institutional demand that drives the GBTC fund that offers a regulated, exchanged-traded method of gaining exposure to Bitcoin.Kraken further states that institutional investors that attempted to arbitrage GBTC’s premium could even hold onto their GBTC shares instead of selling in the secondary market and keep their short positions as well. This would entail that there is no net selling of the token. It is also possible that the investors sell their GBTC shares to cover their short positions, thus resulting in net buying of the token. However, both ways, the impact on spot prices may not be realized immediately as the market might expect.Pete Huminston, the manager at Kraken Intelligence — the research department of the exchange — has downplayed the correlation between the two assets, saying, “Despite one being a single-asset fund of the other, BTC and GBTC are two distinct assets with different forces influencing their respective prices.” He went on to state that “the trading strategies commonly used by institutional investors leads us to conclude that the event could be mildly positive for the Bitcoin price.”Prior to Feb. 23 of this year, the price difference between GBTC to the net asset value of BTC has always been a positive number — i.e., a premium. This premium hit an all-time high of 122.27% on June 6, 2017. However, since the end of February of this year, the premium was converted into a discount hitting an all-time low of -17.86% on May 16.Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks — a Kraken subsidiary — told Cointelegraph about the meaning of this discount, stating, “A negative Grayscale Premium is not a sign that institutional interest in Bitcoin is weakening. On the contrary, it likely speaks to greater choice and enhanced market maturity in the cryptocurrency space.”He also mentioned that the Grayscale premium has also shrunk because of the large number of alternative offerings such as Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF). The increasing prominence of Canadian ETFs, such as Purpose and Evolve, have had a knock-on effect on the allure of the GBTC fund. Chung said, “Without that premium, accredited investors can no longer buy shares at the NAV and sell at a higher spot price post-lock-up.”Related: GBTC premium stays negative, suggests Bitcoin price sentiment still low?Cointelegraph discussed the GBTC discount with Adam Jones, senior editor at OKEx Insights — the research team at the cryptocurrency exchange:He further explained that when the new supply ceases, the market could correct, as currently, it allows investors to get the opportunity to access Bitcoin’s price action at a 10%–20% discount. However, Ai is of the opinion that this discount is unlikely to turn into a premium unless the GBTC funds transition into becoming an ETF using a redemption mechanism.As the biggest unlocking event on July 18 nears, Bitcoin seems to be hovering in a bearish manner near $32,000, causing a domino effect on the entire altcoin market. Since the unlock might not see major downside price movement, there are chances that the price will rebound into higher ranges, eventually having a net positive effect for the flagship token."
235,"A classic Bitcoin (BTC) on-chain indicator has seen a “hell of a bounce” even as price action stays uncertain.In a tweet on July 9, Philip Swift, creator of analytics resource Look Into Bitcoin, highlighted a dramatic change of course for the Puell Multiple.A deceptively simple metric, Puell tracks miner behavior with a view to understanding Bitcoin market extremes.It has served extremely well as an indicator of when BTC price tops and bottoms are likely due, and in late June dipped into its green “buy” zone for only the fifth time in history.Thanks in part to last weekend’s record difficulty readjustment, Swift says, Puell has now reversed upwards — and if it keeps going, higher prices should logically follow.“Hell of a bounce out of the green zone this week for the Puell Multiple,” he summarized.As Cointelegraph reported, miners returning to work after being displaced from China will create more competition and boost the Bitcoin hash rate, with difficulty climbing once again to account for the changes.Estimates vary greatly as to when the turbulence impacting mining will be truly over.A reversal for Puell meanwhile could herald a definitive macro Bitcoin price floor. As trader and analyst Rekt Capital recently observed, dips into the green zone tend to be followed soon afterwards by a BTC/USD bottom.The trip into the green itself occurs while Bitcoin is still preparing to put the bottom in, and does not completely line up with price behavior.Bitcoin price action is seeing strength as the weekend progresses, something which could nonetheless result in a reversal in line with recent short-term trends. Related: BTC price regains $33k as Square confirms 'mainstream' Bitcoin wallet plansThe upcoming Grayscale unlocking events remain a topic of conversation, but opinions differ as to whether BTC/USD will be affected.""This topic is the next big narrative,"" trader Michaël van de Poppe said in an update on Saturday, putting it alongside topics such as Bitcoin options expiries.He added that negative bias is already active across crypto markets, which may give undue credence to the unlocking as a threat to price stability."
236,"Two South African brothers are facing mounting pressure to come forward to authorities as investigators delve into one of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts in the country.Raees and Ameer Cajee are central figures in the now infamous Africrypt cryptocurrency investment scheme saga. Local investors have been left in the dark and out of pocket following what the Cajee brothers claimed was a hacking incident that saw the company’s cryptocurrency holdings stolen.The brothers headed up the purported investment firm which promised lucrative returns on investments, as per its 2020 investment presentation. Clients could either make South African rand or Bitcoin (BTC) deposits to Africrypt, which then managed those investments.Things fell apart in April 2021 after Raees Cajee informed investors through a letter that hackers had allegedly stolen an unconfirmed amount of its holdings. Shortly after the Cajees had pleaded with clients not to opt for legal proceedings, the Africrypt website went offline.There are conflicting reports around the actual value of cryptocurrency that was managed by Africrypt — but a June 2021 report by the Wall Street Journal quoted the eldest brother’s estimate that Africrypt was managing around $200 million worth of cryptocurrency at the height of the market’s 2021 boom.Investors have sought legal counsel in order to wrestle back their funds from Africrypt, while financial regulators have been hamstrung by current regulations of cryptocurrencies in South Africa, which leaves the space out of their jurisdiction.It’s important to note that the Africrypt saga is not the first time that the Cajee brothers' businesses have fallen prey to alleged hacking incidents. Back in 2019, RaeCreate Wealth, which is incorporated in Hong Kong and ran by Cajees’ informed investors, had some of its cryptocurrency stolen during a Binance hack. It is unclear whether investors were ever reimbursed for their losses as the Cajees registered Africrypt in the same year, according to the company’s registration documentation verified by Cointelegraph.The exact whereabouts of the Cajee brothers are still unknown, and the pair have previously claimed their flight from South Africa was necessitated by subsequent threats from a number of disgruntled clients that have banded together to seek legal recourse.Local company Badaspex (Pty) Ltd. is spearheading its own legal effort to recoup funds invested in Africrypt. The company launched an application on April 19, seeking for Africrypt to be liquidated following the scheme’s claims that it had lost investors’ holdings.Cointelegraph contacted Johannesburg-based attorney Gerhard Botha who is representing Badaspex, as well as other investors that lost funds to Africrypt. Botha confirmed that Badaspex is looking to recover $2.4 million (35 million rands) invested in Africrypt, a figure that has not accounted for the appreciation in value of the BTC that was entrusted to the Cajee brothers’ firm. The attorney is representing a total of 105 investors, whose lost investments amount to what he described as a “conservative” $8 million (115 million rands).The attorney also refuted the Cajees’ claim in the WSJ in June that Badaspex’s director Juan Meyer, a figure once linked to locally convicted Czech gangster Radovan Krejcir, had threatened them after Africrypt shuttered.Meyer’s attorney said his client had tried to meet with one of the brothers at a hotel in Johannesburg to discuss Africrypt’s closure. After agreeing to meet, Meyer was left waiting at reception for about 15 minutes before the hotel’s security requested him to vacate the premises. Botha told Cointelegraph that the version of events put forward by the Cajees was “opportunistic,” given that the incident was clearly set out in the court-order application:The Cajee brothers employed the legal services of Johannesburg-based attorney John Oosthuizen soon after the hacking incident was claimed to have taken place. Oosthuizen had made several comments to the media before announcing that he was no longer representing the brothers or Africrypt in late June 2021. Africrypt has until July 19 to make a case against the Badaspex liquidation order application.A separate source undertaking a private investigation into the Africrypt debacle told Cointelegraph that it was aware that 35 separate criminal cases have been opened, seeking around $3.2 million (46 million rands) invested in the scheme.Bank documents seen by Cointelegraph show that more than $7 million (100 million rands) passed through the Cajees’ local business bank account — a point of contention that has been denied by First National Bank.It is understood that the brothers left South Africa in December 2020 and have been traced to different hotels in the United Arab Emirates.This type of financial fraud would usually fall under the jurisdiction of the South African Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA). Cointelegraph reached out to the regulatory body to ascertain whether it is actively involved in ongoing investigations into the Africrypt case.The FSCA replied with a public statement it had released acknowledging complaints received against Africrypt and was investigating whether the firm had actually offered a financial product or service to the public. This is a crucial aspect, as it would have required Africrypt to have registered with the regulator, which it has not. The FSCA statement read:While the FSCA is not in a position to impose any sanctions on the company, it did state that its own investigations into the firm suggest that it was operating a dubious investment scheme: “This entity was offering exceptionally high and unrealistic returns akin to those offered by unlawful investment schemes, commonly known as Ponzis.”In another local report, Raees Cajee claimed that Africrypt had been registered with the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) and that the company had abided by necessary Anti-Money Laundering (AML) controls. Cointelegraph has reached out to the FIC to ascertain whether Africrypt was registered with the center, but has not received a reply at the time of publication.Information provided to Cointelegraph by private investigators allowed for some basic blockchain analysis of transactions sent to and from Bitcoin addresses provided to Africrypt clients over the past few months.Some clients’ wallets received BTC from an original wallet that has received more than 689,000 BTC, worth around $22 billion, since November 2020. Cointelegraph has ascertained that this is the hot wallet belonging to prominent South African cryptocurrency exchange Luno.International blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace assisted in this regard but noted that the exchange was likely to have only been used to handle Africrypt customers’ deposits and not to accumulate holdings. The CipherTrace spokesperson told Cointelegraph:Luno Africa’s general manager, Marius Reitz, told Cointelegraph that Africrypt does not hold a Luno account and that there is no relationship between either company: “Although Africrypt began the process of applying for a Luno account in 2019, the process was never completed and therefore the business account was never opened.”Reitz added that Luno did not receive any customer queries in relation to Africrypt prior to news reports of the company’s collapse. He added that Africrypt had not been flagged by any of the blockchain analytics companies that focus on detecting and preventing the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit activities. Nevertheless, the exchange is involved in ongoing investigations:Private investigators also told Cointelegraph that some BTC was allegedly moved to VALR, another popular South African cryptocurrency exchange, after blockchain analysis was carried out on another Africrypt client's Bitcoin wallet address.VALR CEO and co-founder Farzam Ehsani told Cointelegraph that they could not share any information on its users, while adding that it was registered with the FIC and did what it could to prevent illicit activity through its platform: “VALR is registered with the Financial Intelligence Centre and we engage with the regulators on a regular basis to combat any activity by any actor that seeks to abuse our industry or cause harm to others.”Initial media reports on the Africrypt saga pinned astronomically high values to the amount of assets under the company’s management. Figures as high as $3.6 billion had originally been touted — numbers that Reitz believes are improbable:Reitz also noted that the accuracy of the reported scale of the Africrypt scheme is an important consideration. The sheer scale of the initial amounts reported would simply be unable to be moved or mixed without affecting cryptocurrency markets or being flagged by analytic firms.Reitz further said that following the collapse of Mirror Trading International in 2020, this latest incident serves as an important reminder to investors to do their homework when entrusting assets to third parties:"
237,"As established by Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin (BTC) whitepaper, the core of cryptocurrency is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks. This spirited independence and scoffing at the hand-holding of traditional banking systems is pervasive across the cryptosphere.Yet, when mass adoption is the goal, some hand-holding becomes necessary in order to bring everyone along on the journey toward truly decentralized finance. We cannot expect our grandparents — who have difficulty sending an email — to sort out how to manage private keys, seed phrases and digital wallets and send your birthday gift in Bitcoin without some assistance. Indeed, this transition to decentralized finance is already well beyond sending birthday money and has evolved to include yield farming, liquidity mining and nonfungible token auctions. As such, trusted intermediaries have never been more essential to fulfilling the mainstream aspirations of DeFi and crypto.Related: Liquidity mining is booming — Will it last, or will it bust?Trust is paramount to daily life in any civilization. We trust the opinion of doctors. We trust the taxi driver will take us where we need to go. We trust the food served to us at restaurants is safe to eat. We trust that cars will stop when the walk signal lights at a crosswalk.In the trustless world of cryptocurrencies, we still make decisions about who and what we trust. Most of us are not developers or engineers capable of analyzing the code of every DeFi protocol and every token before we participate. Instead, we gather information and assess what action to take based on what we do understand. Key questions in this decision-making process are: Do we trust the organization and the people behind the protocol? Do we trust that they are acting in good faith and the protocol does what it says it does?Studies have found that where we put our trust is evolving alongside the development of new technologies. Despite the novelty of algorithms deploying machine learning and artificial intelligence, people are increasingly putting their trust in algorithms over fellow human beings. A study published in Science Daily found that when subjects were presented with a crowd photograph and asked who would be better at arriving at the correct number of individuals featured in the picture, more said AI than said humans. At the same time, a different study found that a person's trust in technology is highly dependent on their exposure to it, with degrees in technology or engineering and familiarity with online algorithms leading to higher levels of trust in AI.Related: Mass adoption of blockchain tech is possible, and education is the keyThe results of both studies surely apply to the world of cryptocurrency as well. Growing trust in technology has made the adoption of cryptocurrencies as widespread as it is. Still, it’s important to recognize that this adoption is occurring at varying rates across different demographics. Those with the most exposure to newer technologies — engineers and developers — are the earliest to adopt; those with the least exposure and access to resources trail behind. Therefore, it is incumbent upon those of us immersed in the cryptosphere to prioritize supporting those with less exposure. We do not want to end up with a “technopoly” wherein those with greater technical knowledge are the most privileged and those with the least are denied participation. That hypothetical dystopia would be contrary to the original democratizing promise of Bitcoin.We must acknowledge that cryptocurrency presents unique usability challenges. Even among people who have access to the internet — currently measured at around 4.66 billion — use is often limited to social media, search and email. These web users are comfortable with email and password logins. Adding management of private keys — a string of jumbled numbers and letters that is difficult for the human eye to interpret — requires overcoming this lack of familiarity that web users have grown accustomed to.Related: Decentralized finance may be the future, but education is still lackingThe core value of ""your keys, your coins"" is revolutionizing our financial systems by endowing users with control over their assets rather than relying on banks and other centralized third-party service providers. However, this empowerment also comes with a burden many people new to the space may not immediately be ready for. We've all heard the horror stories of users losing their private key and, as a result, being denied access to potentially millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency.I'm of the view that we shouldn't insist on throwing newbies into the crypto waters and demanding that they swim. Once people become comfortable managing their private keys, the training wheels can come off, and they can take on the burden (and benefits) of ""your keys, your coins"" themselves.The percentage of DeFi users remains quite small. According to the ConsenSys Q1 “DeFi Report,” the overall numbers are estimated to be around 1.75 million. Compared to the 4.66 billion internet users, this disparity highlights the massive opportunity for growth in the crypto economy. I would argue that the exchanges and platforms that prioritize education, user experience and customer support over all else will separate themselves from the pack and take the lead this year and into 2022, gaining significant portions of this untapped market.Related: To accelerate cryptocurrency adoption, we must first improve user experienceWomen, in particular, are a rapidly growing user demographic, and crypto platforms are not spending enough resources as they should catering to them. A CoinGecko 2020 user survey found only 9% of women have even heard of DeFi. This disparity between male and female users is unacceptable.The only way cryptocurrencies will achieve their true potential and empower a global user base with control over their own value is if we see adoption across all demographics, including gender, age, education, geography and technical knowledge. Therefore, as much as decentralized technologies strive to eliminate intermediaries, the human touch remains critical to the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

238,"On July 9 Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market saw a moderate relief rally that helped recover some of the losses seen on Thursday but a handful of analysts continue to caution that BTC could still drop to the $24,000 to $29,000 range in the short-term. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin was bid higher during the morning trading hours on Friday and managed to climb back above $34,100.Sentiment among traders received a slight boost after Bitcoin price reversed course and rallied back to $34,000 but the price still remains trapped between key resistance and support levels and the lack of buy volume is still a valid concern.Tempting Beef, a pseudonymous trader on crypto Twitter, also pointed out that the total crypto market cap and altcoin market cap remain in a precarious position. #Crypto total market cap and altcoin market cap both failing to flip their key pivots and forming lower highs. Me sad.

Unless we pull it together, I expect us to just play in this range maybe with some standouts like $AXS. Could be a boring summer. pic.twitter.com/Ab4eVSCbdoÉlie Le Rest, partner at digital asset management firm ExoAlpha, also pointed out that along with the “non-directional trend” in BTC, the market is also ""witnessing a decrease in trading volume” that has led to ""more wild reversals within the range, hurting directional traders.”Le Rest said:Due to the market volatility, Le Rest sees market participants staying on the sidelines as they wait ""for the Grayscale trust to stop offloading their Bitcoins and for the Chinese regulatory crackdown to cool-off.”Le Rest also pointed to the scrutiny financial regulators all over the world are putting on Binance, as “a considerable problem that reduces the capacity of the market to get the capital inflow needed to break above $40,000.”According to Le Rest:While it’s true that BTC price fell below the weekly support level near $34,500, pseudonymous crypto Twitter analyst Rekt Capital was quick to point out that the price found support at another established support level near $32,200 resulting in “no major changes in the trend.”Related: Bitcoin is a miracle and better than gold, says Apple co-founder WozniakOne possible bullish indicator highlighted by some analysts is the 'Entities net growth' Bitcoin metric, which has climbed to new highs in recent weeks as the price of BTC languished below $40,000.In times like these when uncertainty prevails, the simple strategy of dollar-cost averaging is one that even the most experienced traders turn to in order to decrease stress and re-focus on the long-term price outlook.If Bitcoin price drops, I will buy more.

If Bitcoin price goes up, I will also buy more.

239,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) steady range-bound trading opened the door for select altcoins to rally higher as antsy traders scour the markets in search of profitable opportunities. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the top 3 movers over the past 24 hours are Synthetix (SNX), Axie Infinity (AXS) and EOS.The growing momentum in both decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfugbible tokens have helped lead to a boost to prices, while the adoption of a stablecoin on the EOS protocol is a major source of validation for the EOSIO ecosystem. According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, Synthetix (SNX) has been one of the strongest performers of the past week, rallying 100% to hit a multi-week high of $12.76 on July 5 as excitement for DeFi-related tokens began to build.As seen on the chart above, the price of SNX has rallied 32% from a low of $9.17 in the early trading hours on July 9 to reach an intraday high at $12.14.One possible factor playing into the rise of SNX over the past week is the generous 39.3% APY offered to SNX stakers, which may have contributed to the current increase in volume and subsequently resulted in an increase in the total value locked on the Synthetix protocol.The second-best 24-hour performer is Axie Infinity (AXS), a blockchain-based trading and battling game that allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as Axies.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for AXS on July 5, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for AXS climbed into the green zone on July 5 and reached a high of 82 around three hours before its price began to surge 115% over the next two days to establish a new all-time high at $16.70 on July 7.The third best 24-hour performer is EOS, a layer-one blockchain network that made waves in 2017 when it raised more than $4 billion during its initial coin launch.Related: DeFi focused: Grayscale exploring 13 more crypto assets for its trustsThe most significant recent development for the protocol was its selection to host the Ducat, a native algorithmic stable coin of the American CryptoFed DAO, which became the first legally recognized decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in the United States after supportive legislation passed in the U.S. state of Wyoming.This development comes on the heels of a $10 billion investment by Block.one to build Bullish Global, an exchange based on EOSIO protocol and it points to a growing list of use cases for the delegated-proof-of-stake (DPoS) platform.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

240,"Earlier this week, Fan Yifei, the deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China has warned that stablecoins like Tether (USDT) pose “risks and challenges to the international monetary system, and payments and settlement system”. Fan did not even spare Bitcoin (BTC) and called it a tool for speculation and a possible threat to “financial security and social stability.” Other than the FUD from China, several traders have been focusing on the unlocking of a large amount of Bitcoin at the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust as a possible bearish sign. However, market analysis by crypto trading firm QCP Capital said the event won’t have any “significant impact on the overall market outside of GBTC itself.”On a more positive front, analyst William Clemente said that more than 50,000 new Bitcoin entities are coming on-chain a day and it is not only retail that has been buying. According to Clemente, whales have started accumulating and their overall holdings have increased by 65,429 BTC.The big question for traders remains whether to buy in the current zone or wait for a further fall. Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to identify the possible path of least resistance.Bitcoin has been trading in the lower half of the $31,000 to $42,451.67 rectangle for the past few days. This is a negative sign as it shows that demand dries up at higher levels and bears are not waiting for a sharp rally to initiate short positions.The 20-day exponential moving average ($34,440) has started to turn down again and the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped below 46, suggesting that bears have a slight advantage.The sellers will now try to sink the BTC/USDT pair below the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone. However, it is unlikely to be easy because the bulls will mount a strong defense at the zone.If the price rises from the current level or rebounds off $31,000, the buyers will again try to push the price to $36,670. A breakout of this resistance will be the first indication of strength. That will clear the path for an up-move to $42,451.67.But if the $28,000 support collapses, panic selling may ensue as stops of traders who have been accumulating above $31,000 may hit. The next support on the downside is $20,000.Ether (ETH) rose above the 50-day simple moving average ($2,350) on July 7 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. That may have attracted profit-booking by short-term traders and shorting by aggressive bears.The ETH/USDT pair dropped below the 20-day EMA ($2,203) on July 8 but the positive sign is that the bulls are aggressively defending the support at $2,000. If buyers thrust the price above the moving averages, the pair could rise to the downtrend line. A break above this level will be the first indication that the correction may be ending.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will again try to sink the pair below $2,000. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the next critical support at $1,728.74. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the bearish momentum may pick up and the decline could extend to $1,536.92.The relief rally in Binance Coin (BNB) hit a wall at the 50-day SMA ($231), which suggests that bears continue to sell at higher levels. The sellers will now try to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($312).If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could drop to the $276.40 to $264.26 support zone. The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the pair rises from the current level or rebounds off the support zone, the bulls will again try to push and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could rise to $379.58 and then to $433.Alternatively, if the bears sink the price below $264.26, the next stop could be $211.70. A break below this level will signal the resumption of the downtrend.The failure to rebound off the 20-day EMA ($1.38) between July 5 to July 7 indicated a lack of buying in Cardano (ADA). Due to this, the short-term traders may have booked profits on July 8, which pulled the price below the 20-day EMA.The price has rebounded off the $1.28 support today. The bulls will now try to push the ADA/USDT pair above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the buyers will make one more attempt to clear the hurdle at the 50-day SMA ($1.47) and drive the pair to the downtrend line.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink the pair below $1.28. If that happens, the pair may drop to the critical support at $1. This remains the level to watch on the downside because a break below it could result in long liquidation. If that happens, the pair may drop to $0.68.Dogecoin (DOGE) slipped below the $0.21 support on July 8. However, the positive sign is that the bulls did not dump their positions on the break but bought the dip. This indicates accumulation at lower levels.The bulls will now try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.24). Such a move will be the first indication that buyers are attempting to a comeback. Above the 20-day EMA, the DOGE/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.29) and then to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern.However, the downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone indicate that bears have the upper hand. If the price again turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that buying dries up at higher levels. The bears will then make one more attempt to sink the price to the critical support at $0.15.The failure of the bulls to propel XRP above the 20-day EMA ($0.68) in the past few days shows that demand dries up at higher levels. Traders who were anticipating a break above the 20-day EMA seem to be liquidating their positions, resulting in a break below the $0.63 support.If bulls do not push and sustain the price above $0.63 quickly, the bears will try to capitalize on the advantage and pull the price below $0.58. If they manage to do that, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to psychological support at $0.50.A break below this level may result in panic selling. The next support on the downside is at the support line of the descending channel. This negative view will be nullified if the price turns up and breaks above $0.75.The bulls nudged Polkadot (DOT) above the overhead resistance at $16.93 on July 7 but they could not sustain the higher levels. The bears dragged the price back into the $13 to $16.93 range on July 8. This suggests that bears are not willing to let go of their advantage.The bears will now try to break the immediate support at $14.50 and pull the price down to $13. Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside.If bears sink the price below $13, the downtrend could resume and the DOT/USDT pair could drop to the psychological support at $10. This negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $17.66.The bulls pushed Uniswap (UNI) above the 50-day SMA ($22.03) on July 6 and 7 but they could not sustain the breakout. This suggests the bears sold at higher levels and tried to trap the bulls.Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. The price has rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($20.21) today but the bulls will have to push and sustain the price above the downtrend line to gain the upper hand.If they manage to do that, the UNI/USDT pair could start its northward march to $30. On the other hand, if the pair drops below the uptrend line, it will signal that bears have the upper hand. The pair could then slide down to $15 and then $13.Related: Bitcoin is a miracle and better than gold, says Apple co-founder WozniakBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading in a tight range between $475.69 and $538.11 for the past few days. Usually, such a tight consolidation near the resistance results in a breakout to the upside but that has not yet happened.The failure to rise above the overhead resistance may attract profit-booking from short-term traders. That could result in a break below the tight range. If that happens, the BCH/USDT pair could decline to $428.43 and later to $370.The 20-day EMA ($518) is sloping down marginally and the RSI is below 44, which suggests the bears are trying to gain the upper hand. This negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $538.11. That could open the doors for a rally to $650.35.Solana (SOL) broke above the 50-day SMA ($34.43) on July 7 but the bulls could not clear the hurdle at the downtrend line. The bears sold at this resistance and pulled the price back below the moving averages on July 8.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the support at $31.36. If buyers push the price above the moving averages, the SOL/USDT pair could reach the downtrend line. A breakout of this resistance may result in a rally to $44.However, if the price turns down from the current level or the downtrend line, the pair may trade between $31.36 and the downtrend line for a few days.The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between buyers and sellers. The bears may gain the upper hand if the $31.36 support cracks. That could result in a decline to $26.65.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

241,"The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, or ECLAC, a United Nations’ regional commission to encourage economic cooperation, is the latest regulator to raise concerns about El Salvador’s decision to accept Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender.ECLAC executive secretary Alicia Bárcena has warned that El Salvador’s Bitcoin move poses a number of systemic risks as well as risks related to money laundering, local news agency Diario El Mundo reported Friday.Bárcena emphasized that there is no study yet that would have investigated potential risks or benefits of El Salvador accepting BTC as legal tender. She expressed confidence that El Salvador is likely to face scrutiny and risks from the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, regarding its decision to move into Bitcoin.The official added that Bitcoin does not fulfill some basic functions of money and is subject to extreme volatility, which could pose “multiple systemic risks” in a dollarized economy.Related: Survey finds most El Salvador citizens are skeptical of making BTC legal tenderIn issuing the warning, the ECLAC joins a growing number of global authorities and organizations getting increasingly concerned about El Salvador's decision to adopt BTC as legal tender after Salvadorian president Nayib Bukele announced historic legislation in early June. The International Monetary Fund was one of the first regulators to subsequently call attention to the matter, warning that accepting Bitcoin as legal tender in the country could pose legal and financial concerns.On June 17, the World Bank refused El Salvador’s request for help on the country’s transition to adopting Bitcoin, citing issues related to Bitcoin’s alleged environmental impact and transparency. Earlier today, Bank of Russia deputy governor Alexey Zabotkin also expressed concerns over El Salvador’s Bitcoin move, arguing that large economies are unlikely to follow the country’s call to adopt BTC as legal tender as this poses risks to financial stability."
242,"Bitcoin (BTC) came back to life later on July 9 after a whale-induced price dip failed to hold the market down for much more than 24 hours.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD jumping 2% in an hour on Friday, hitting local highs of $33,700 on Bitstamp.The previous day had been marked by a trip lower and a test of $32,000 support, something which had come on the back of sudden short selling by an entity on Bitfinex.With $33,000 support now back in play, however, traders were once again hopeful that existing short-term theories could still play out. ""Bitcoin is still holding a critical level of support and potentially making a new higher low here,"" Michaël van de Poppe summarized in his latest update.Van de Poppe had eyed a potential run to as high as $39,000 should Bitcoin break through the start of a resistance band at $35,500.We’re doing it #Bitcoin https://t.co/IwbKuBoXGvThe rebound followed an announcement payment gateway Square, which confirmed that he would be developing a ""mainstream"" cryptocurrency hardware wallet.""We're doing it,"" Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey responded to a post from the latter's hardware lead, Jesse Dorogusker.Dorogusker had also said that the plans would include a ""service to make bitcoin custody more mainstream,"" with further details still outstanding.As Cointelegraph reported, industry researchers had already flagged new bullish tendencies across on-chain metrics in the latter part of the week.Related: Bitcoin price will likely shrug off $530M GBTC unlock in July — AnalysisThese showed, among other things, record numbers of new Bitcoin network entities, these now topping 50,000 daily.Whales, for their part, were also keen to scoop up the supply, a theory supported by popular statistician, Willy Woo.""As price grinds sideways-bearish, coins are being scooped off the exchanges at a very bullish rate,"" he told Twitter followers on Thursday, alongside a chart of net flows from exchanges.""PS.

243,"In her monthly Expert Take column, Selva Ozelli, an international tax attorney and CPA, covers the intersection between emerging technologies and sustainability, and provides the latest developments around taxes, AML/CFT regulations and legal issues affecting crypto and blockchain.Talk about ending a stellar career at the United States Department of Justice with a bang. The DoJ’s first-ever “crypto czar,” Michele Korver, advised government attorneys, federal agents, the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Stability Oversight Council and the U.S. delegation to the Financial Action Task Force on cryptocurrency matters, and she developed cryptocurrency seizure and forfeiture policy and legislation. While she was wrapping up her last day on the job, an affiliate of the notorious “REvil” gang, which is best known for extorting $11 million in Bitcoin (BTC) from meat processor JBS after an attack on Memorial Day, executed the single biggest global ransomware attack on record to kick off the July 4 holiday weekend.Related: Meet DoJ’s Crypto Czar: Expert takeREvil’s supply chain-targeted ransomware attack successfully spread malware to thousands of businesses in at least 17 countries that outsourced their IT department to Kaseya, a privately held company based in Dublin, Ireland. It did so in one fell swoop, thanks to Kaseya’s compromised IT management software, VSA — resulting in a $70 million payday in Monero (XMR). If REvil is successful, they could perform a second attack on the businesses that chose to pay the Mondero demand. According to a recent report by Cybereason titled “Ransomware: The True Cost to Business,” 80% of businesses that choose to pay a ransomware demand are targeted a second time. REvil could then turn around and launder the illicit proceeds on dark web markets, as outlined in a report issued by Flashpoint and Chainalysis.Related: Are cryptocurrency ransom payments tax-deductible?Criminals prefer using cryptocurrency tumblers/mixing services or privacy coins like Monero when paying for illicit goods and services in order to obscure the trail back to the fund’s original source, points out Korver, who co-authored an article titled “Surfing the First Wave of Cryptocurrency Money Laundering” in a journal issued by the DoJ. As she writes:For example, Korver explains: “To first possess cryptocurrency, criminals [including cyberattackers and ransom demanders] must set up wallets. Those wallets might be under their exclusive control [un-hosted wallets], or they might be custodial wallets hosted by a third-party service provider, such as an institutional exchange. Once in a wallet, funds can be sent to mixing services or gambling sites to obscure their historical trail. From there, the funds can be converted to fiat currency through exchanges, P2P exchangers, or kiosks. Sometimes, the funds will then be sent to bank accounts or cryptocurrency debit cards where they can be used to buy things or pay off debts. While this is the typical way in which the primary domains appear in the PLI process, criminals can use the domains in almost any way they want: Wallets can be used to mix funds; P2P exchangers can be used to integrate the funds; and kiosks can be used for layering. Criminals can also repeat the steps of the PLI process to further obfuscate the origin of the ill-gotten funds, though they incur additional costs and risk every time they repeat the cycle.”Related: The United States updates its crypto AML/CFT lawsIn the context of ransomware payments, the number of which has increased by around 500% since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Korver goes on to say that “Victims of ransomware attacks have relied on P2P exchangers. With the rise of ransomware as a standardized criminal enterprise, an increasing number of victims have been forced to purchase cryptocurrency in short order. It has been estimated that 9% of Bitcoin transactions are attributable to ransomware or some other form of cyber extortion payment. If it takes days or weeks to open a validated account at an institutional exchange, a P2P exchanger can offer cryptocurrency at a moment’s notice, and victims are willing to pay this speed premium. Victims have noted that ‘the processing times [at a registered institutional exchange] were far beyond the scope of the immediacy posed by the ransom’ and that a P2P exchanger was a better option for obtaining cryptocurrency in a hurry.”Prior to Korver’s arrival at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN authorities proposed a rule taking aim at transactions involving unhosted cryptocurrency wallets, which are generally software installed on a computer, phone or other device. The cryptocurrency in an unhosted wallet are controlled by an individual, who can receive, send and exchange their crypto assets person-to-person with other unhosted wallets, or on an exchange platform, without revealing their identity — making it more difficult to trace and scrutinize transactions for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing compliance risks.Related: Authorities are looking to close the gap on unhosted walletsThese concerns are shared by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental body responsible for setting AML standards. The updates proposed by the FAFT to its 2019 guidance expand the definition of a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) to include several noncustodial cryptocurrency businesses, meaning they will be subject to AML/CFT regulations. Peer-to-peer decentralized exchanges/structures (except for rules that apply to all entities, like targeted financial sanctions) remain under review.As cryptocurrencies — along with ransomware attacks — become more mainstream, Korver will advance FinCEN’s leadership role in the digital currency space by working across internal and external partners to bring forward strategic and innovative solutions to prevent and mitigate illicit financial practices and exploitation.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
244,"On July 8, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert hosted an Elon Musk-inspired show in Austin, Texas. Aptly named “F*ck Elon,” the event, which included a large number of Bitcoin (BTC) maximalists, was surely a rowdy affair. Keiser is known for many things, but restraint is not necessarily one of them.Although we can debate the merits of such a provocatively titled party, Musk’s divisiveness is certainly not up for debate. Earlier this year, the Bitcoin community — including the maximalists — were vocal supporters of Musk. He saw value in Bitcoin and Bitcoin saw value in Musk, one of the most influential people on the planet. In many ways, it was a match made in heaven.Related: Tesla, Bitcoin and the crypto space: The show Musk go on? Experts answerIn early May, however, when the 49-year-old announced that Tesla was no longer accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment, Musk's popularity among the Bitcoin faithful quickly faded. Now, many view him with suspicion; others, like Keiser, view him with disdain, hence the colorfully titled party.One wonders, what’s the point of a “F*ck Elon” event? After all, we're told that Musk no longer influences the cryptocurrency market like he once did back in May. The once highly potent master is now an impotent “shill.” Although the authors made valid points, it’s important to remember who Musk is, and, more importantly, what he is capable of doing. Bitcoin is very much in his crosshairs.Related: Experts answer: How does Elon Musk affect crypto space?Three weeks ago, the Tesla CEO announced that the company plans to accept Bitcoin once clean energy goals are met. In other words, Bitcoin and Musk have unfinished business. Considering that the future of Bitcoin appears to be inextricably linked with clean energy, the future of Bitcoin also appears to be inextricably linked with Musk.Right now, his influence over Bitcoin appears to be minimal, but there is every reason to think that will change. Form is temporary, class, though, is permanent. And Musk is a first-class manipulator. Dogecoin (DOGE) is a fun coin but it doesn’t appear to have a legitimate future. Bitcoin, on the other hand, appears to have a very bright future. It’s fun to mess around with DOGE, but if you’re serious about cryptocurrencies, you marry Bitcoin.Related: No, Musk, don’t blame Bitcoin for dirty energy — The problem lies deeperBy its very definition, a toxic relationship consists of Jekyll and Hyde personalities, where at least one of the partners switches between hot and cold. Now, enter Elon Musk. One day he is bowing down and paying homage to the Chinese Communist Party, the next day he is calling a hero a pedophile on Twitter. Musk is an erratic force. He is the only man who can match Bitcoin’s inherent volatility.In a toxic relationship, exhaustion is the norm. Musk is an exhausting influence and there is reason to believe that he will continue to exhaust humanity, especially those within the Bitcoin community. Toxic relationships are also synonymous with deceit. A highly intelligent individual, Musk is also prone to exaggerations and false promises. Since 2016, Tesla customers have been billed for the highly publicized self-driving feature that doesn’t really exist.Related: Crypto’s fraught relationship with Elon Musk: Ambassador or liability?As Andrew J. Hawkins at The Verge writes, the full self-driving software that Musk promotes “does not enable a Tesla vehicle to drive itself without input from the driver.” In other words, self-driving cars are not capable of self-driving. This is not a good look for Tesla, nor is it a good look for Musk. Whether his deceit is conscious or otherwise, Tesla customers have been taken for an expensive ride. With General Motors and Ford busy learning from Musk’s mistakes and making superior electric vehicles, will Musk’s behavior become more erratic in nature? Don’t bet against it — Bitcoiners beware.Musk is not an inventor. He is a mercurial entrepreneur, willing to say or do anything to generate interest. Although he is clearly a brilliant man, he lacks restraint. Musk’s word is not his bond. In fact, in Musk’s world, the concept of truth seems to be highly malleable.In a recent article, Peter Chawaga discussed a sort of post-Elon world, with Bitcoin freeing itself from the entrepreneur’s meddling. Chawaga noted, “No single person, no matter how influential in their own spheres, is more vital than the network.” In the same piece, the aforementioned Stacy Herbert says:Has Bitcoin actually “fixed” Elon? Can Elon actually be “fixed?” Bitcoin might have won this battle, but the war, I argue, is far from over. Of course, it needn’t be a war. In the future, Bitcoin and Musk may very well enjoy a harmonious relationship. However, considering Musk is one of the most erratic celebrities on the planet, the relationship will probably become more toxic in nature. Screaming “F*ck Elon” might be cathartic, but it won't be effective. Remember who you are dealing with: A highly influential billionaire with a “F*ck You” personality.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

245,"Bitcoin (BTC) on-chain activity is ""dead"" but on-chain indicators are overwhelmingly positive right now, says analyst William Clemente.In the latest edition of Anthony Pompliano's weekly newsletters, Clemente highlighted multiple metrics showing no reason to be bearish about Bitcoin this month.With BTC price action failing to impress, there is no shortage of bearish outlooks on Bitcoin, with even its best-known price models coming in for criticism.If on-chain data is anything to go by, Clemente argues, the situation is far from bearish.""The growth of new users is now reaching new all-time highs, over 50,000 new entities coming on-chain a day,"" he summarized.Those new entities could well be putting pressure on exchange reserves, which have resumed their downtrend — in the past week alone, almost 18,000 BTC has left exchange wallets.""Retail has been buying heavily for weeks now, but we finally got the uptick in whales that we were waiting for,"" the newsletter continued.As Cointelegraph reported, whales have already been in the news for other reasons this week, with one giant build-up of short positions on exchange Bitfinex instigating a price dip which lost BTC/USD important $33,000 support.More broadly, by contrast, Clemente views current activity as an ""uptick in positive whale activity.""Elsewhere, cause for optimism comes from a diminishing premium on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) despite the impending unlocking events.Hash rate has likewise not returned to challenge recent lows of 83 exahashes per second (EH/s), leaving only transaction numbers to worry about.""Overall, on-chain activity is dead, shown by the number of Bitcoin transactions,"" Clemente acknowledged.Even here, however, there is a caveat.""If I had to build up a bear case and challenge my own opinion this is one of the charts I would use; however, a portion of this drawdown is likely from people using the Bitcoin network less due to slower block times,"" he reasoned."
246,"As Bitcoin (BTC) has continued trading sideways after dipping below $33,000 on Thursday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has provided some geopolitical observations regarding the industry.In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Novogratz said that Bitcoin price is now consolidating between $30,000 and $35,000, suggesting that the United States’ crypto community is now taking the lead in the market amid a bearish trend coming from Asia.The longtime Bitcoin bull noted that China’s crackdown on the crypto market is part of broader issues in the market, stating:Novogratz also pointed to a possible correlation in Bitcoin ownership within diversified portfolios, noting that some investors could be offloading some of their crypto holdings. “If you’re a hedge fund and you’re getting whacked in your rate position and your equity position and your oil position, you’re probably going to sell some of your crypto as well,"" he said, adding, ""It just takes a while for it to build a more diverse investor base.”Related: China’s miner exodus a ‘big net positive for crypto,’ Mike Novogratz saysAfter hitting an all-time high above $64,000 in mid-April, Bitcoin has been consecutively dropping in recent months, largely prompted by alleged environmental concerns over Bitcoin mining as well as a major crackdown on crypto investment and mining by Chinese authorities. The overall sentiment on the crypto markets has been further deteriorating to “extreme fear” levels amid global financial regulators taking multiple actions against Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.But despite the market’s growing concerns, some major players in the U.S. have continued their efforts to further nurture the industry in the country. On Thursday, major U.S. mining company Gryphon Digital Mining purchased a major batch of crypto mining rigs from Bitmain, a Chinese mining giant that had to halt its spot sales due to China’s crackdown on crypto mining. In June, Miami mayor Francis Suarez publicly invited foreign crypto mining companies to consider establishing data centers in the city amid miner capitulation in China."
247,"Popular cryptocurrency trader Keith Wareing warned Bitcoin (BTC) traders about a critical bearish scenario brewing in the market.The trader spotted Bitcoin inside an inverse cup-and-handle pattern earlier this month, a bearish structure that forms during a price wave downward, followed by a stabilizing period. The technical design typically leads the price lower by as much as the size of the previous decline.Bitcoin topped near $65,000 in mid-April before reversing to the downside in later sessions. The cryptocurrency crashed to as low as $28,800 on June 22 after attempting to keep prices above $30,000 repeatedly. It successfully did so but fell short of extending its bullish reversal momentum after facing comparatively higher selling pressure in the $35,000–$36,000 range.The pattern’s handle part appeared like it is nearing exhaustion, prompting Wareing to say that Bitcoin’s price would fluctuate inside the structure for another three to four weeks. After that, the cryptocurrency would rally lower, insomuch that it could hit $24,000.“If the handle breaks down, expect 24k -29k to be the new range. [...] 3-4 more weeks of range-bound imo,” Wareing wrote in an update on Friday.Bearish warnings for Bitcoin picked up momentum in the weeks after global regulators increased their crackdown against the cryptocurrency sector. For example, in China, the central bank effectively banned all forms of crypto-related activities, including mining, one of the few surviving crypto industries following Beijing’s restriction on cryptocurrency trading in 2018.Meanwhile, Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange by volume, came under pressure from regulators in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Canada, Japan, and Cayman Islands over its sprawling crypto operations.The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority banned Binance from regulated financial activities last month. That prompted Barclays, Faster Payments and Santander to block its banking customers from accessing Binance.Bids for BTC/USD also went down alongside traditional markets on rising concerns about the global economy primarily after days of sharp moves in sovereign bonds hinted at slower growth and inflation than previously anticipated.“We are seeing an asset allocation change with people selling risky assets across the board and buying into the safer returns of government bonds,” noted Shaniel Ramjee, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management, after yields on the 10-year United States Treasury note fell to as low as 1.276% on Thursday for the first time since February 2021.Yields drop when bond prices rise.Clem Chambers, CEO of financial analysis service ADVFN, suggested that bulls should wait for a crash before dipping their toes in the Bitcoin market again, noting that the next best accumulation opportunities appear when the cryptocurrency dumps to $20,000.Nevertheless, bulls remained hopeful that Bitcoin’s growing recognition in the mainstream space, especially against the persistent fears of higher inflation, would take the cryptocurrency out of its bearish slumber.“Bitcoin has been trapped for most of the last 3 weeks in a long and tight (8%) trading range $32,500-$35,000,” said Ronnie Moas, founder of Standpoint Research.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

248,"Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has reportedly reiterated his positive stance on Bitcoin (BTC) despite not being a Bitcoin investor himself.A vocal proponent of Bitcoin who once called it the “only digital gold,” Wozniak reportedly referred to Bitcoin as a “miracle of technology” and a “unique mathematical formula” at Talent Land Digital 2021, a major virtual event in Latin America devoted to technology and innovation.According to Thursday a report by local news agency El Sol de México, the Apple co-founder has also indicated that Bitcoin is better than gold, implying that it’s easier to mine Bitcoin blocks than finding and extracting gold:Many industry players and analysts have referred to Bitcoin as the “digital gold,” as both gold and Bitcoin have a limited supply, thus potentially retaining value on the market. While gold is limited by physical supply and the difficulty of extraction, Bitcoin mining is capped at 21 million coins by its source code, meaning that there will be no single new Bitcoin once the last coin is mined in 2140.Related: Bitcoin on ‘inevitable path’ to reach gold’s market cap — Mike NovogratzWozniak’s remarks come shortly after Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the third-richest man in Mexico, declared that it’s “absolutely right” to refer to Bitcoin as the new gold. “That’s totally right, Bitcoin is the new gold, but much more portable, transporting Bitcoin is so much easier than having gold bars in your pockets,” the billionaire businessman said.Wozniak provided similar comments on Bitcoin previously, claiming that “only Bitcoin is pure digital gold” in June 2018. The tech guru noted that he bought into comments from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who has repeatedly argued that Bitcoin will emerge as the single currency of the internet."
249,"Gryphon Digital Mining has signed a purchase agreement with Bitcoin (BTC) mining equipment maker Bitmain to purchase 7,200 Antminer S19J Pro mining rigs.According to a release issued on Thursday, the entire outlay for the mining inventory amounts to about $48 million. Starting in August 2021, Bitmain will deliver 600 mining rigs to Gryphon each month as part of the deal.The Antminer S19J Pro is the latest iteration of Bitmain’s Bitcoin mining hardware slated for release into the market this summer. According to the release, each rig offers 100 terahashes per second (TH/s) hash rate capacity with an energy efficiency ratio of 29.5 joules per terahash. With 7,200 of these machines in tow, Gryphon will theoretically see its hashing power increase by a factor of 720 petahash per second (PH/s).Achieving a hashing capacity of 720 PH/s — or 0.72 exahashes per second — will put Gryphon in the top 15 Bitcoin miners by hash rate distribution according to data from BTC.com. Such a milestone could be an added achievement for the American Bitcoin miner as it sets out to achieve 100% renewable energy-based operations.Related: Bitcoin miners can prove green potential by undergoing ESG ratings checkBack in June, Brittany Kaiser, chair of the board of directors at Gryphon, told Cointelegraph that the company’s electricity source was 100% renewable. Kaiser also revealed that Gryphon will receive its ESG rating upon the launch of its mining hardware in August.Crypto mining has come under increased scrutiny in recent months over energy consumption. Earlier in July, the Bitcoin Mining Council estimated that the global Bitcoin mining industry was running on a 56% renewable energy supply.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, data from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index has shown that BTC’s electricity consumption is down almost 60% from the highs recorded in mid-May.This decline is most likely due to Chinese miners going offline following a sweeping crackdown from the authorities in the country. Several establishments have been forced to relocate their hardware overseas."
250,"Israeli defense minister Benny Ganz has signed an order authorizing security forces to seize cryptocurrency accounts believed to be tied to the militant wing of Hamas, the de facto ruling authority of the Gaza Strip in Palestine. Ganz has said that a joint security operation between the Ministry of Defense's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing and the security forces had “uncovered a web of electronic wallets” thought to be tied to Hamas and its ongoing fundraising efforts, using Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. Hamas' long-running efforts to raise funds via crypto had reportedly recently accelerated following the 11-day war between Israel and the organization in May of this year. In his statement, Ganz presented “the intelligence, technological and legal tools"" that had enabled the authorities to intercept the funds as ""an operational breakthrough.”Details of the wallets seized by the ministry reveal that they contained Tether (USDT), Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), Zcash (ZEC), Litecoin (LTC) and multiple other altcoins. A significant number of wallets have been linked to named individuals, but the majority have been designated by the authorities as anonymous.Hamas has turned to cryptocurrencies due to its financial isolation, which stems from its classification as a terrorist organization, in whole or in part by several countries and international blocs — including the United States and the European Union. Russia, Turkey and China are among those who do not designate Hamas as a terrorist entity. Related: Hamas’ militant wing reportedly using multiple BTC wallet addresses to elude authoritiesHaving governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, the organization comprises of a social service arm, “Dawah” and a militant wing, “Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades,” the latter of which has been behind much of Hamas' documented Bitcoin fundraising activities. Over the years, the al-Qassam Brigades have evolved increasingly sophisticated strategies to prevent investigative authorities from red-flagging wallets associated with their campaign.According to a cyber desk report from the Interdisciplinary Center’s International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) published in 2020, digital wallets allegedly tied to both Hamas and the Iran-affiliated al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades (the military wing of the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees) had succeeded in raising almost 3,370 BTC over a four-year period.

251,"Bitcoin (BTC) stayed below the $33,000 mark on Friday, with a fresh price dip also putting an end to altcoin strength. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed BTC/USD as it ranged below a previous support level into Friday.Earlier in the week, $33,000 saw multiple tests but remained in place as support, this only coming undone on Thursday.The $33,000 price level then became involved in a form of short-term support/resistance flip, with Bitcoin unable to reclaim it and, conversely, seeing rejection at each attempted rally.At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency traded at around $32,700, stuck in a narrow range with $32,000 as its floor. For popular trader Crypto Ed, the time was right to eye macro trends for hints as to what could happen to Bitcoin next.In particular, the United States dollar was on the radar — upside in the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), currently at 92.4, should first subside in order for crypto markets to have room to breathe.“Still keeping an eye on DXY for strength in crypto... I think not before DXY reaches red box, reverses and continues its downtrend. ~$94,= it is,” he commented on the day.As Cointelegraph often reports, DXY strength tends to be coupled with increased price pressure on Bitcoin, with the reverse also true. This inverse correlation is not fool-proof, however, with the past year seeing multiple exceptions to the rule.On altcoins, meanwhile, gains were muted by Bitcoin’s slide lower.The top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization saw modest losses overnight, contrasting with previous strength. Related: Is Bitcoin overbought or oversold? Use Bollinger Bands to find out!Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin, likewise tracked sideways despite continued progress on its upcoming London hard fork. As noted by trader and analyst Rekt Capital, however, price action can still target levels below $2,000 and remain “confluent” with the overall uptrend in 2021.“Lots of confluent support in the $1850–$2000 area,” he added as part of various comments on Thursday.An attack on 0.07 BTC for the ETH/BTC pair likewise ended in defeat as the week drew to a close, this itself short of major resistance at around 0.075 BTC."
252,"According to a newly released survey, up to three-quarters of Salvadorans are skeptical over President Nayib Bukele’s Bitcoin adoption plans.The survey, which polled 1,233 people across El Salvador between July 1 and 4, revealed that only 20% approved of the plan to make Bitcoin legal tenderThe survey, which has a margin of error of 2.8%, was conducted by researcher Disruptiva, which is affiliated with Francisco Gavidia University. According to Reuters, it found that about 54% of people viewed the Bitcoin adoption program as “not at all correct”, while another 24% described it as “only a little correct.”Almost half of the respondents, or 46%, admitted that they knew nothing about Bitcoin. Around 65% of them were not open to the idea of being paid in digital currency.Head of Disruptiva’s institute of science, technology, and innovation, Oscar Picardo, commented that “this is a risky bet on digital transformation.”The country’s new Bitcoin law was passed on June 9, and is due to take effect on September 7 making the world’s leading crypto asset a parallel official currency in the Central American nation. Late last month, the government unveiled a Bitcoin wallet called Chivo but stated that it is just one option available.At the time, Bitcoin aficionado Bukele stated that the wallet will not incur fees or commissions for transfers and will not take a cut for converting BTC to USD.In late June, he stated that every Salvadoran adult who downloads the Chivo wallet app will be eligible for an airdrop of $30 worth of BTC.Related: El Salvador adopting Bitcoin could make it lose market dominancePresident Bukele has touted BTC adoption as a way to facilitate remittance payments from citizens living overseas and lessen reliance on the U.S. dollar which has been the national currency since 2001.Around 70% of the population in El Salvador does not have access to bank accounts or any financial services, but if this small survey is anything to go by, they have yet to see the merits of Bitcoin as a potential solution."
253,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape and enterprise blockchain integrations.The summer of crackdowns continued this week, making it seven weeks since the initial announcement on May 18 that virtual currencies were a risky investment and financial institutions should not provide services for them. The crackdown appears to be having the desired effect, as public interest in the asset class is cooling. This is evident by 90-day lows on WeChat searches for the word ""Bitcoin"" (BTC) over the past weekend, although this was a trend mirrored on worldwide Google searches as well.The central bank was the aggressor this week, posting an announcement on its website on Tuesday that it and other relevant institutions are not allowed to directly or indirectly provide customers with virtual currency-related services. The announcement also mentioned that institutions can not provide services such as business venues, commercial displays, marketing campaigns and payment diversion for business activities related to virtual currencies. As usual, comments on Weibo were strongly in favor of the regulation, as China’s social media still has a vocal section of traditional investors.On July 1, NFT gaming giant Animoca Brands announced it had received $50 million in investment from Blue Pool Capital, created by tech entrepreneur Jack Ma in 2015, which manages a portion of his $52.1 billion net worth. Blue Pool Capital also manages a portion of Joe Tsai’s wealth, who is the current executive vice chairman of Alibaba. Animoca Brands develops and publishes NFT games such as REVV Motorsport and The Sandbox.The BTC mining hash rate is still down around 50% as Chinese miners sit on the sidelines or look to relocate. This led to a difficult adjustment in the Bitcoin consensus algorithm, making blocks around 28% easier to mine. As a result, the remaining miners became an estimated 50% more profitable, according to a Cointelegraph report.Many people, including Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, spoke out about the positive consequences of the current crackdown. Nick Spanos of Zap Finance stated that Bitcoin was an unstoppable machine due to the fact that “the world’s second-biggest economy can’t crush, devalue and manipulate Bitcoin.” This conclusion from Spanos ignores the fact that China derives very little social value from crushing or devaluing Bitcoin. The current policy is more interested in eliminating inefficient use of energy and risky speculative trading behavior.On Tuesday, the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau banned the China Blockchain Application Research Center. Specific reasons for the ban were not given, although the official response claimed that the research center was carrying out illegal social activities. It’s likely that the center had been involved with cryptocurrencies, and considering the official nature of their name, was deemed to have acted illegally. It’s very common for organizations to take official-sounding names in an attempt to improve their status within the industry.The China Blockchain Application Research Center was founded in Beijing in November 2015 by the Museum of Internet Finance and some other institutions in the blockchain industry. It claimed to have regional centers set up in Hangzhou, Shanghai, Silicon Valley and Dubai. In hindsight, their contribution to the industry appears to have been minimal, making this legal action more ceremonious than anything."
254,"Trading is neither an exact science nor art. It is a mixture of both. There are scores of publicly available indicators and each claims to be the best. However, none of them are perfect or designed to be used in isolation.One of the more popular indicators widely used by several traders is Bollinger Bands, an indicator that can be used to spot price peaks, lows, and opportunities for shorting during exhausted rallies and buying during sharp pullbacks.Let’s learn three simple methods to use this indicator in trading.John Bollinger created and copyrighted the Bollinger Bands in the 1980s. The indicator consists of a middle band, which is a simple moving average whose default is set at 20-periods and two outer bands set at two standard deviations below and above the middle band.Its most basic use is to identify whether the price is high or low on a relative basis. If the price is above the upper band, the asset is perceived to be overbought. On the other hand, if the price dips below the lower band, the coin is believed to be oversold.However, many traders make the mistake of assuming that the asset price will drop when it reaches the upper band, or that a rally will start when the price hits the lower band.This generally happens only when the price is stuck in a range. As with any other indicator, assumptions can easily lead to huge losses in a trending market so looking for confluence from a number of metrics is still a good pratice to employ.Let’s look at a few ways traders use the Bollinger Bands.According to John Bollinger, assets switch between phases of low volatility and high volatility. Therefore, after periods of low volatility, traders may expect the volatility to shoot up, which could result in trending moves.The above chart shows how XRP’s volatility dropped sharply between mid-September to mid-November 2020, marked as an ellipse on the chart. After about two months of this low volatile phase, the volatility shot up and the XRP/USDT pair offered an excellent trading opportunity.In the above example, Binance Coin (BNB) was in a downtrend and the volatility tightened between the end-September to mid-November 2018, marked as an ellipse on the chart. Here, the volatility expanded to the downside and the BNB/USDT pair resumed its downtrend.A volatility squeeze does not predict the direction of the next breakout. Sometimes, the market makers nudge the price above the upper band and below the lower band, trapping the novice traders. Therefore, traders may avoid pre-empting the direction and wait for the price to either break above the resistance or below the support of the range before establishing a position.The above chart shows how the overly eager bulls and bears can become trapped. On Oct. 22, 2020, the bulls pushed the price above the upper band but could not clear the resistance at $5.77. After a few days on Nov. 3, 2020, the price pulled below the lower band but did not break the support at $4.58.Ethereum Classic (ETC) broke above $5.77 on Nov. 18, 2020, but it was not a perfect trade as the price did not start a strong uptrend. The market makers went hunting for buyers’ stops and also tried to trap the bears with the sharp drop on Dec. 23, 2020.However, the price quickly climbed back above the lower band on Dec. 24, 2020, and the ETC/USDT pair soon started a strong up-move.Therefore, instead of relying only on the signal from the Bollinger Bands, traders should also look for confirmation from other supportive indicators or use the support and resistance lines.A pullback in an uptrend is usually a buying opportunity as the main trend tends to reassert itself. When the middle band slopes up and the price trades in the area between the middle band and the upper band, it is a sign of an uptrend. In this scenario, traders may wait for the bounce off the middle band to initiate long positions.Litecoin’s (LTC) chart shows the start of an uptrend in mid-February 2019 as the middle band turned up and the price traded between the middle band and the upper band. After that happens, traders may attempt to buy the rebound off the middle band and keep the stop-loss just below the swing low.There were five possible entry opportunities for a conservative trader. Four of them turned out to be winners but one would have hit the stops. This shows how no strategy is perfect, hence a stop-loss should always be used to limit the risk.Solana (SOL) turned down from above the upper band on Sep. 1, 2020, and broke below the middle band on Sep. 3, 2020. Since then, the price largely remained inside the lower band, which turned down on Oct. 2, 2020. That confirmed the downtrend and gave an opportunity to traders to short on Oct. 13, 2020, as the downtrend resumed, following a move to the middle band.One of the most profitable ways to trade is to buy and hold during strong uptrends. However, this is easier said than done because several traders sell too early out of fear and others keep waiting for the dip.This is where the double Bollinger Bands can come in handy. Its use has been popularized by Kathy Lien, the managing director of FX Strategy for BK Asset Management.To construct the setup, traders use the default value for the first Bollinger Bands. For the second Bollinger Bands, keep the value of the moving averages the same at 20-day SMA but reduce the value of the standard deviation of the outer bands to 1.As shown above, in an uptrend, the aim is to buy when the price trades between the upper band of the first and second Bollinger Bands.There are several entry opportunities possible and a trader would wait for the price to close between the upper bands for three successive days before buying because this can help to avoid unexpected whipsaws.Traders can keep the initial stop-loss below the middle band but quickly trail it higher to reduce the risk and protect profits. One of the possible exit strategies would be to sell on a close below the upper band of the Bollinger Bands with one standard deviation.The chart above shows how the strategy is used. Traders may have entered on Dec. 19, 2020, and remained in the trade until the stops hit on Jan. 11, 2020. Another buying opportunity arose on Feb. 7, which finally hit the stops on Feb. 23.This strategy should be avoided when the price is oscillating in a range and to improve the odds, traders could only open new positions when the price breaks out of a stiff overhead resistance.The Bollinger Bands can be a good tool to aid traders in identifying a trend early by spotting the volatility squeeze, which is usually followed by an expansion in volatility and a trending phase.Even if a trader missed buying early, the Bollinger Bands can be used to join the trend during pullbacks with a low-risk entry opportunity.The indicator can also come in handy for trading a strong trending phase where corrections are shallow.There are many different ways to use the Bollinger Bands and this article just provided a few guidelines that traders can explore.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

255,"Bitcoin’s total estimated annual electricity consumption has plummeted nearly 60%, falling from the all-time peak above 143 terawatt-hours (TWh) in May to as low as 62 TWh in early July, according to data from Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI). This is the lowest energy consumption rate recorded since early November 2020.At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s annualized electricity consumption is estimated at 67 TWh, while the upper bound consumption, or the absolute maximum total electricity expenditure based on the worst case assumption, stands at 162 TWh, down from 520 TWh in mid-May.The lower bound estimate, which corresponds to the absolute minimum total electricity expenditure based on the best case assumption that all miners always use the most energy-efficient equipment available on the market, has also dropped from 47 TWh to 24 TWh.Despite global regulators continuing to blame Bitcoin (BTC) for excessive energy consumption and associated environmental catastrophe, Bitcoin’s energy consumption has in fact massively dropped recently, according to some data.Related: Bitcoin Mining Council survey estimates a 56% sustainable power mix in Q2As previously reported, Bitcoin’s parabolic bull action leading its price above $64,000 in April had driven a massive growth in the amount of electricity consumed by Bitcoin miners, spurring major debates over possible environmental impact of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin later experienced a major sell-off after Tesla CEO Elon Musk suspended Bitcoin payments for Tesla vehicle purchases on May 12.In line with Bitcoin prices, Bitcoin’s estimated electricity consumption has been rapidly falling since the announcement, prompted further by China’s crackdown on the cryptocurrency mining industry. After closing down crypto mining facilities in Inner Mongolia this April, Chinese authorities enforced a series of crypto mining bans in major crypto mining hubs including hydropower-based provinces like Sichuan and Yunnan, as well as Xinjiang and Qinghai."
256,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price looks poised to retest $30,000 as traders continued to pull back from upside bets on a spell of a bearish technical pattern.Dubbed as a Symmetrical Triangle, the structure forms when an asset fluctuates between two converging trendlines.In doing so, the asset rebounds after testing the Triangle’s lower trendline as support and pulls back upon treating the upper trendline as resistance. Eventually, it breaks out of the range, in the direction of its previous trend, and falls by as much as the maximum distance between Triangle’s upper and lower trendline.Bitcoin was trending inside a similar Triangle-like consolidation pattern until it ultimately broke below the structure’s lower trendline. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency’s probability of shifting its downside target near $30,000 increased. That is partly because the structure’s maximum height was shy of $2,550, and subtracting it from the point of breakout (~$33,878) lands the price objective near $31,308.The bearish setup also surfaced as Bitcoin tested $32,334 as its interim support in Thursday’s early London session. A minor bounce ensued that took the price above $32,600. However, the rebound lacked additional upside conviction owing to a bearish divergence between prices and volumes, suggesting that Bitcoin might resume its trend to the downside.Peter Brandt, chief executive of Factor LLC — a global trading firm — also suggested a decline toward $30,000, albeit using a different indicator. The veteran trader spotted BTC/USD exchange rates inside a rectangular pattern, a price block that has lately been keeping Bitcoin in a medium-term bias conflict.The price traded midway through the rectangle upon pulling back from its upper trendline resistance. Such a move typically prompts the spot BTC/USD rate to fall toward the lowest rectangle support level, which coincided with $30,000.Unsupportive macroeconomic fundamentals, in part, fueled the latest Bitcoin price drop.The primary among them was the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s gathering that came out Wednesday around 14:30 EST. As expected, the United States central bank officials suggested that they might end up pulling back their support of the economy sooner than they had expected.“Various participants mentioned that they expected the conditions for beginning to reduce the pace of asset purchases to be met somewhat earlier than they had anticipated at previous meetings in light of incoming data,” the minutes read.Bitcoin tends to benefit from loose monetary policies.The cryptocurrency surged from as low as $3,858 in March 2020 to as high as $65,000 in mid-April 2021 as the Fed slashed its benchmark lending rates to near zero, thus affecting the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power, and started buying government bonds and mortgage-backed securities at the rate of $120 billion per month, pushing down yields.For clarity, central banks’ asset purchase programs cause inflationary pressures, for they expect to monetize a part of the government’s deficit spending. Such purchases tend to inflate prices of equities and fixed-income investments. Coupled with cheaper lending, the loose monetary programs increase fiat liquidity in the system, boosting Bitcoin’s “superior store of value” narrative against an unlimited dollar supply.As a result, investors started shifting to riskier safe-haven assets, including Bitcoin, to seek better returns. But as soon as the fears of the Fed’s tapering grew over markets, Bitcoin started declining. On Wednesday, Bitcoin’s move lower from above $35,000 came right after the central bank’s minutes went public.John Miller, a financial analyst associated with Seeking Alpha, noted that the Fed’s hawkish notions offset chairman Jerome Powell’s aim to ensure strong long-term monetary accommodation. In the latest minutes as well, Powell called the U.S. economic recovery weak, citing weak job growth in June.“The Fed’s accommodative balance sheet policy will continue to support elevated liquidity in the banking system and backstop asset prices,” Miller wrote.Alexey Veledinskii, product owner at cryptocurrency spot and derivatives exchange Digitex, anticipated Bitcoin to hold $30,000 on persistent inflation concerns.

257,"Turkey’s crypto userbase has grown more than 11 times over the last year, a new survey from Turkish crypto exchange Paribu shows. The “Cryptocurrency Awareness and Perception Survey 2021” was conducted by Akademetre Research, revealing the perceptions and behaviors of Turkish citizens toward Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. The first survey was completed in 2020.A significant discovery of last year’s research was that only 0.7% of over 6,000 respondents traded crypto in some form. On top of that, 84% of respondents had never heard of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies before. These results have contrasted with previous reports that claimed one-fifth of the Turkish population was exposed to cryptocurrency.This year, however, shows a substantial jump in terms of cryptocurrency usage in Turkey. Out of about 1,400 respondents, 7.7% said they traded with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, marking a jump of 11 times in crypto users compared to last year.According to the survey, 11% of respondents with crypto knowledge have become active crypto users. As a major crypto exchange in the country, Paribu reflects the adoption speed with its user count, which grew from 600,000 to over 4 million within a year.Related: How did the Turkish crypto ecosystem survive 2020?High earnings (60%) and curiosity (37%) are primary motivations for Turkish citizens to use cryptocurrencies. Nearly one in four respondents used cryptocurrency because it was tech-based. On the other hand, the increase in crypto usage does not translate into blockchain familiarity, as the survey shows that 80% of respondents who know about crypto have never heard of blockchain.Commenting on the results, Paribu CEO Yasin Oral said that the market’s price movements and exchanges’ marketing activities boosted crypto awareness in Turkey. Some local exchanges’ actions that took advantage of users affected the survey results negatively, he noted, adding, “Trust in cryptocurrencies is increasing, but this research shows us one more time that we need clear regulations to establish a complete trust for the userbase.”"
258,"Senator and former United States presidential aspirant Elizabeth Warren has once again raised alarms about the current regulatory climate for crypto in the country.According to Reuters, Warren has written to Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, demanding answers about the scope of the SEC’s crypto oversight in the area of consumer protection.In a statement issued by Warren, the chair of the Subcommittee on Economic Policy bemoaned the lack of protection for crypto investors against the activities of rogue actors, adding:According to Reuters, Warren’s letter to Gensler asked the SEC chairman to determine whether crypto exchanges are undermining the commission’s goal of ensuring a fair investment market environment.For Warren, the current lack of basic investor protection laws for the “highly opaque and volatile” crypto market is “unsustainable.” Gensler reportedly has until July 28 to respond to Warren’s query.Related: Elizabeth Warren compares 'bogus' crypto to 'legitimate' CBDCs in senate hearingAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, Warren is a noted crypto critic who described digital currencies as “bogus private money” during a Senate Banking Committee hearing back in June.Indeed, the senator’s anti-crypto rebuke echoes sentiments shared during the hearing where she described cryptocurrency as a “lousy investment.”Several administration officials, including Janet Yellen, Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department, are also outspoken critics of cryptocurrencies."
259,"Bitcoin (BTC) will not move much after Grayscale’s giant 16,000-BTC unlocking date, after all, said crypto trading firm QCP Capital. In its latest market update released on Wednesday, analysts downplayed the popular theory that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) will cause BTC’s price volatility in the coming weeks.As Cointelegraph reported, the GBTC is due to release, or “unlock,” a large amount of BTC after a six-month lock-up period.A frequent event, the size of the unlockings set for this month has nonetheless led to concerns that market volatility will increase, hindering a potential recovery.On July 18, for example, the largest unlocking date, 16,240 BTC will become available, currently equal to $530 million.For QCP, however, there is little reason to be concerned.“The upcoming unlocks are for institutional holders who subscribed directly to GBTC 6 months ago — and this batch consists of all the new Q1/2021 positions, largely ARK’s last tranche,” it explained.Currently, even GBTC unlocking events are due to have all but disappeared by mid-August, reducing the likelihood of selling pressure further. Causing a headache for QCP, however, is the possibility of a larger Bitcoin sell-off event at the end of the year. Related: Bitcoin price could hit $85K in months as indicators flip bullish — ReportIn line with historical precedent, the end of Q4 could see a classic blow-off top scenario that will follow a recovery and run-up from current levels.This analysts likened to 2018, which culminated in a bear market floor of $3,100 — 84% below the all-time highs of $20,000 12 months before.“Right now our trading plan follows the 2018 BTC Analog — where we expect a dampened trading environment from here to Aug (short vol), followed by a rally possibly on the back of the EIP-1559 mainnet implementation (long spot, long calls), and then the larger Q4 Wave 5 selloff on the Fed’s taper (sell spot, buy downside risk reversals),” they continued.How high BTC/USD gets in the meantime, meanwhile, is a matter of fierce debate. Among the most bullish tried-and-tested models is stock-to-flow, the creator of which, PlanB, has said that a $135,000 price in December is a “worst-case scenario.”"
260,"A new survey paints a bleak picture of British crypto investors' motivations, knowledge and exposure when it comes to their investments.Almost two in five (36%) of retail crypto investors in the country have conceded that their understanding of the sector was ""poor or non-existent"" when they made their first investments. As time has gone on, 21% of investors holding crypto still rated their knowledge of the sector as being equally low.The survey was conducted by Oxford Risk, a commercial software firm whose focus is on products for wealth managers and financial services firms.While small – just 1,038 respondents – the research sample for the survey was reportedly weighted to reflect the United Kingdom's demographic profile.In addition to low levels of investment literacy when it comes to crypto, the survey indicated that demand for digital assets was driven by FOMO, or fear of missing out. Some 35% of respondents said they read widely about skyrocketing crypto prices and 15% said they had been encouraged to invest in the sector by their friends or family. Greg B Davies, head of behavioural finance at Oxford Risk, said:A large minority are also still unsure about the market’s future: 45% responded that they don’t know whether there will be continued price appreciation, 32% were unconvinced there would be, and 24% were firm believers that there would. Regardless, 21% of respondents plan to either buy crypto for the first time this year or increase their current holdings. Notably, most investors have put in relatively small amounts of cash into the sector: 81% said they’d bought just a bit of crypto in the spirit of “see what happens,” 76% have invested less than 5% or less of their total savings and 41% less than 1%. 7% of investors, however, have staked as much as 20% of their total assets in crypto, whereas 10% have staked more than 10%.According to a recent study by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, 2.3 million adults in the country held crypto assets as of June 2021, up from 1.9 million last year. In addition to the increased number of investors, the FCA found that median holdings had risen to £300 ($420), up from £260 ($370) in 2020.This uptick was accompanied by an increase in awareness levels, with 78% of U.K. adults saying they’d heard of crypto — again, up from 73% the previous year. However, just like Oxford Risk, the FCA remarked on a notable decline in the understanding of crypto, similarly suggesting that many consumers did not understand the technology and industry."
261,"As Binance faces scrutiny from regulators around the globe, Poland’s finance watchdog has issued a consumer warning about the cryptocurrency exchange.On Wednesday, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA) published a statement on Binance’s growing regulatory issues around the world, stressing that the company’s operations are unregulated in Central European countries. The crypto market is “neither regulated nor subject to supervision” by the PFSA, the regulator noted, cautioning the public about the risks associated with trading on Binance, given the growing pushback to the exchange from global financial regulators, stating:The PFSA mentioned several regulatory warnings against Binance by global regulators, including those issued by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand. As previously reported, Binance is subject to regulatory investigations and reviews in countries such as Canada, Japan, the United States and Singapore.Additionally, the PFSA referred to its January warning on the general risks of investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), stating that the crypto market is not regulated in Poland.Related: Binance suspends euro bank transfers amid regulatory heatThe PFSA and Binance did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.The PFSA’s statement comes shortly after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao reiterated the company’s commitment to cooperating with global regulators in order to comply with financial market regulations. The CEO stated that there is still a lot of regulatory uncertainty around crypto but welcomed more regulations as they are, in his view, “positive signs that an industry is maturing.”"
262,"The Chinese central bank is “quite worried” about the global financial risks associated with digital currencies, particularly stablecoins, according to a senior official.Fan Yifei, a deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), expressed concerns over the reportedly serious threat stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), pose to global financial and settlement systems, CNBC reported on Thursday.The official emphasized that the speed of development in private payments systems is “very alarming,” and the PBoC is working against monopolies and the “disorderly expansion of capital,” adding:Fan noted that the Chinese government has already taken some measures to limit the expansion of global stablecoins in the country. The deputy governor stressed that the PBoC will apply the same restrictive measures that it took on Alibaba’s Ant Group to other entities in the payment services market.As previously reported, the Chinese state halted Ant’s $37-billion initial public offering last November, also launching an antitrust probe into Alibaba. Mu Changchun, head of digital currency research at the PBoC, later said that China’s central bank digital currency is designed to provide backup for major retail payment services like AliPay and WeChat Pay as its key objective. According to Fan, China’s invitation-only digital yuan system has amassed more than 10 million users so far.Apart from cautioning against stablecoins, Fan also criticized major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), stating that such digital currencies have “become speculation tools” and pose potential threats to “financial security and social stability.”Related: Stablecoins under scrutiny: USDT stands by ‘commercial paper’ tetherChina has taken a tough stance on the cryptocurrency industry, recently renewing its crackdown on crypto mining activity as well as cryptocurrency trading.Meanwhile, some of the world’s biggest payments companies such as Visa have doubled down on their positive stance on stablecoins. “Stablecoins are on track to become an important part of the broader digital transformation of financial services, and Visa is excited to help shape and support that development,” the company wrote in its official crypto update on Wednesday."
263,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $33,000 support on Thursday as a trusted trading range risked getting invalidated.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dipping into the $32,000 range during trading on Thursday.The move followed an overnight retracement from around $35,000, with Bitcoin failing to crack crucial resistance.With that, Bitcoin risks invalidating a bullish scenario, which involves it entering the next stage of a Wyckoff distribution with the potential to exit to the upside — around $39,000.“Losing $33K range and I’m looking at $31-31.4K,” popular trader Michaël van de Poppe warned just before the dip began.At the time of writing, volatility still meant that a recovery back within the range was possible, with BTC/USD circling $32,500 after local lows of $32,490 on Bitstamp.The latest price action came hours after fresh selling pressure thanks in part to an unknown whale trying to short it with over 5,000 BTC.As noted by journalist Colin Wu, Thursday had witnessed short positions build up on major exchange Bitfinex.Related: Data fails to conclude that Bitfinex shorts are depressing Bitcoin priceA mystery Bitfinex user began entering short positions with a stack of at least 5,219 BTC, worth $173 million at $33,000 levels.“According to datamish data, from 13:00 Beijing time, a account (or institution) has borrow bitcoin to short on Bitfinex,” Wu reported.At the time of writing, total Bitfinex short positions had increased 160% in around two hours.Bitfinex shorts remained roughly balanced with longs, Bybt figures nonetheless showed.The whale shorting is not new. As Cointelegraph reported, June, likewise, saw fluctuations in trader behavior, with Wu eyeing 15,000 BTC worth of bets flooding in on a fresh price dip on June 25. The next day, BTC/USD saw a fresh retest of $30,000 support."
264,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) range-bound action seems to be increasing the confidence of institutional investors looking to resume investing in cryptocurrencies. Proof of this comes as Marshall Wace, a London-based hedge fund, announced plans to invest in the digital asset space, according to sources at the Financial Times.A survey of wealth managers and institutional investors already holding crypto, from the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, and the UAE shows that 82% of the respondents expect to increase their investments in digital assets by 2023.The research shared with Cointelegraph claims that only 7% of the participants plan to reduce their exposure to crypto, while 40% plan to “dramatically increase their holdings.”More evidence of institutional interest was highlighted in a report from CoinShares which revealed a total institutional inflow of $63 million into digital asset funds. The buying was broad-based as all individual digital assets with dedicated funds witnessed inflows for the first time in nine weeks.However, the arrival of institutional investors is unlikely to result in a sharp upswing in crypto prices in the short term. This is because institutions gradually accumulate their desired exposure before boosting prices higher.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to identify the levels that will suggest the start of a possible uptrend.The bulls have been holding Bitcoin above the trendline for the past few days. A breakout and close above $36,670 will complete an ascending triangle pattern that could result in a move to the overhead resistance at $42,451.67.The bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance at $42,451.67. If the price turns down from this level, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $36,670. If buyers can flip this level into support, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips.That will increase the possibility of a break above $42,451.67. Such a move will suggest that the correction has ended and the pair is ready to start a new uptrend.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the trendline, the pair may drop to $31,000. This is an important level to watch out for because the bears have not been able to manage a close below it.If that happens, it will indicate that the bears have absorbed the demand. A break below $28,000 could result in panic selling, opening the gates for a drop to $20,000.The bulls have sustained Ether (ETH) above the 20-day exponential moving average ($2,219) for the past three days, which indicates that the sentiment is turning positive. The buyers are currently attempting to push and sustain the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($2,369).If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from it but rebounds off the 20-day EMA, then the possibility of a break above the downtrend line increases.Such a move could open the gates for a move to $2,990.05. A break above this resistance will suggest that the correction is over.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that bears are selling on rallies. The pair could then drop to $2,000 and then $1,728.74.Binance Coin (BNB) broke above the 20-day EMA ($312) on July 6, which suggests that the demand is picking up. The bears may now try to defend the 50-day SMA ($333) aggressively.However, the flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) above 53 indicate the bulls are back in the game. If buyers push and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to $379.58 and then $433.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 50-day SMA and plummets below $264.26, it will suggest that bears have overpowered the bulls and are back in the driver’s seat. The pair could then drop to $211.70.Cardano (ADA) has been trading above the 20-day EMA ($1.39) for the past three days but the bulls have not been able to challenge the 50-day SMA ($1.49). The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This equilibrium will shift in favor of the bulls if they propel the price above the 50-day SMA. That could result in a move to $1.60 and then to the overhead resistance at $1.94. The bears are likely to defend this level aggressively.Contrary to this assumption, if bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to $1.20. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will make one more attempt to clear the overhead hurdle. However, if the $1.20 support cracks, the pair could drop to $1.Dogecoin (DOGE) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($0.25) on July 5 but the bears have not been able to sink the price below the $0.21 support. This suggests that selling dries up at lower levels.However, if bulls do not drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the selling may resume. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 41 suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside.A break below $0.21 could open the doors for a decline to $0.15. This is an important support for the bulls because a break below it could result in panic selling. The DOGE/USDT pair could then drop to $0.10.Alternatively, if bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may rally to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern.XRP has been sandwiched between $0.63 and the 20-day EMA ($0.70) for the past few days. This tight-range trading suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. Therefore, traders seem to be avoiding large bets.However, this consolidation in the small range is unlikely to continue for long. Soon, the price may start a decisive move. If bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance at $0.75, the XRP/USDT pair could rise to $0.93 and later to $1.07.On the contrary, if the price plummets below $0.63, the bears will try to pull the price down to $0.58 and then to $0.50. A break below the psychological level at $0.50 will suggest the resumption of the downtrend.The bulls are attempting to push Polkadot (DOT) above the overhead resistance at $16.93 and the 20-day EMA ($17.07). If they succeed, the altcoin could rally to the 50-day SMA ($20.43) where the bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance.However, following the breakout, if buyers arrest the next decline at the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a possible change in sentiment. The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI above 45, signal that bulls are trying to make a comeback.If buyers propel the price above the 50-day SMA, the DOT/USDT pair may start its northward march toward $26.50. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and slides below $13.The bulls defended the 20-day EMA ($20.11) on July 5, which indicates a possible change in sentiment. The buying continued on July 6 and the bulls pushed Uniswap (UNI) above the 50-day SMA ($22.20). There was a weak attempt by the bears to stall the relief rally at this level but that has been overcome by the buyers today.The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI has risen above 56, indicating that buyers have the upper hand. There is a minor resistance at $25 but if this level is crossed, the UNI/USDT pair may rise to $27 and then $30.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and the bears pull the pair below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, it will suggest that the bears have trapped the aggressive bulls, opening the possibility of a fall to $16.93 and later $13.Related: Bitcoin battles $35K as traders agree volatile BTC price move incomingBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been clinging to the overhead resistance at $538.11 for the past few days. A tight consolidation near a stiff resistance usually results in a break above it.The flat 20-day EMA ($524) and the RSI above 46 indicate the bulls are trying to make a comeback. If buyers propel the price above $538.11, the BCH/USDT pair could start its upward journey to $650.35 and then $800.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the 50-day SMA ($596) and breaks below $475.69, the pair may drop to $370. Such a move may keep the pair range-bound between $370 and $538.11 for a few more days.Solana (SOL) had been trading between the 50-day SMA ($34.67) and the horizontal support at $33 for the past few days. This showed that the bulls were not dumping their positions near the 50-day SMA and were buying on dips below $33.The failure of the bears to sustain the price below $33 attracted buying and the bulls have driven the price above the 50-day SMA today. The SOL/USDT pair could now rally to the overhead resistance zone at $41.75 to $44.If the price turns down from this zone but rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment has changed from sell on rallies to buy on dips. That will improve the prospects of a break above $44. If that happens, the pair could start a new uptrend. The bears may gain the upper hand on a break below $31.36.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

265,"Timothy Massad, who served as Chair of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission between 2014 and 2017, has laid out the reasons why he thinks regulators should approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. In an opinion piece published on Bloomberg Wednesday, Massad said the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, should approve a Bitcoin ETF in a manner that would enhance the transparency and integrity of the nascent cryptocurrency industry. This way, investors can access the digital asset without having to buy it off exchanges or worry about self-custody.Massad said the ideal path for approving a Bitcoin ETF would begin with a stronger regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. However, he acknowledged the “likelihood of that happening in the near future is low."" In a February interview with Cointelegraph, Massad described U.S. crypto regulations as being like “swiss cheese,” or full of holes.In the absence of comprehensive regulations, Massad says the SEC can use the ETF listing process to improve the integrity of cryptocurrency exchanges.“The approval would be granted on the condition that the ETF price be based on an index of exchanges meeting certain prescribed standards, similar to those for securities and derivatives exchanges,” he wrote.U.S. securities regulators have been hesitant to approve a Bitcoin ETF due to concerns around liquidity, transparency and outright price manipulation. Several ETFs have been submitted to the SEC, and each one has been sent back to the issuer for review. The SEC is currently reviewing a handful of applications and has invited public comment on a prospectus filed by asset manager VanEck.Related: Cathie Wood's Ark Invest teams up with 21Shares to file for Bitcoin ETFAccording to at least one subject matter expert, Todd Rosenbluth, a Bitcoin ETF approval is at least one year away.

The Purpose Bitcoin ETF continues to attract investments despite the massive correction in the Bitcoin price since May."
266,"Global payments giant Visa will continue to support the development and adoption of the cryptocurrency industry as part of its business, the company said in its latest crypto update.In an official statement on Wednesday, Visa announced that its crypto-enabled cards processed more than $1 billion in total spending in the first half of 2021.The company noted that Visa is partnering with 50 major companies in the crypto industry as well as crypto card programs enabling users to convert and spend digital currency at 70 million merchants worldwide. Given the size of spending on Visa crypto-linked cards, the company said that “it’s clear that the crypto community sees value in linking digital currencies to Visa’s global network.”Visa emphasized that its digital currency support does not require global merchants to accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) directly though. As previously reported, Visa has been working with major crypto players like cryptocurrency exchange platform Crypto.com to enable a crypto settlement system for fiat transactions. The company has also been closely working with other major crypto companies like FTX exchange, Coinbase, CoinZoom, and others.The firm also stated that stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets or fiat currencies like the United States dollar — are “starting to live up the promise of digital fiat,” outlining its developer-friendly features combined with the reliability of fiat-backed reserves. “Stablecoins are on track to become an important part of the broader digital transformation of financial services, and Visa is excited to help shape and support that development,” the company wrote, adding:Related: BlockFi starts shipping Visa-backed Bitcoin rewards credit cardsOne of the world’s largest payment companies, Visa made a major move into the crypto industry last year, partnering with Goldman Sachs-backed blockchain company Circle in order to make its USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin compatible with certain credit cards.

267,"Bitcoin (BTC) took a stab at key resistance around $36,000 on Wednesday as anticipation built around a breakout.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD repeatedbly tapping but failing to flip the $35,000 mark on Wednesday.The largest cryptocurrency rebounded from lower levels overnight, calming those concerned that important $33,000 support would be violated. With the area around $36,000 providing a significant resistance band, however, low volumes and a general “compression” structure kept bulls firmly in check on the day.For popular trader Michaël van de Poppe, Bitcoin needed a clean breakout at $35,500 to cement continuation of bullish action. That said, the potential upside limit under such circumstances could be much higher.“If $35,500 breaks, I think we are going to get a run towards even $39,000,” he explained in his latest YouTube update.A retest of recent highs just below $37,000 should then enter, with success opening up the path to higher levels.“Really, the higher timeframe level is between $40,600 to $42,000,” he continued.Altcoins, meanwhile, continued their moderate upside shift, with Ether (ETH) notably holding on to strength against BTC. The ETH/BTC pair, in particular, is now at a monthly high. The top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization saw daily gains of up to 13%, while other tokens remained flat.Related: Is the Bitcoin bull run only in the ‘disbelief’ market cycle phase?“What are my expectations on the markets in general? I think we’ve bottomed out,” van de Poppe concluded.Fellow trader and analyst Rekt Capital joined in predicting an end to the middling price movements, which have characterized Bitcoin in recent days.“A volatile move for BTC is coming in the next few days,” he forecast, referencing the popular Wyckoff method as a hint that any potential move would be up, not down."
268,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues trading sideways inside the $30,000–$40,000 range, new data is emerging about the potential for a bullish breakout.Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, anticipates a potential supply shock in the Bitcoin market, as long-term holders continued raking BTC supply from short-term ones. Woo stated in his Friday newsletter that the process might push more Bitcoin out of circulation.The analyst referred to the ratio of Bitcoin held by strong hands versus weak hands — also known as Bitcoin Supply Ratio — noting that the former is actively absorbing selling pressure from whales who have been dumping their crypto holdings since February.“It reminds me of the supply shock that went by unnoticed by the market in Q4 2020,” wrote Woo. “Pundits were debating whether BTC was an inflation hedge in a post-COVID world when the data was pointing to long term investors stacking BTC at a fast pace.”Glassnode, another on-chain data analytics service, also boosted Bitcoin’s booming adoption prospects. The portal revealed that the Bitcoin network has been onboarding an average of 32,000 new users every day, which is a new high for 2021.The Bitcoin Network User Growth metric last topped in January 2018, hitting approximately 40,000 before correcting lower alongside the prices. It showed that new users stopped coming to the Bitcoin network as its price crashed from the $20,000 top in January 2018 to as low as $3,200 in December 2020.“This is not the structure we are experiencing right now,” explained Woo. “New users are taking this opportunity to buy the dip; they’re coming in at the highest rate seen in 2021.”Bitcoin is currently stuck below $34,000 at publishing time, up 17.52% from its previous bottom level of $28,800 on June 22.Meanwhile, Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO of crypto-enabled payment network Mercuryo, believes that Ether (ETH) may steal the limelight from Bitcoin in the near term as the London hard fork approaches.“The proposed launch of the London Hard Fork upgrade and the ultimate migration to Ethereum 2.0 is helping to renew investors’ confidence,” he added. “Once the hype settles, Bitcoin could move up to $50,000 in the short-to-medium term perspective.”Data analytics firm CryptoQuant reported earlier Tuesday that Bitcoin’s net outflow transaction count from spot exchanges crossed the 60,000-mark for the first time in a year. Meanwhile, the total number of Bitcoin deposits to spot exchanges’ wallets decreased to below 20,000.The BTC withdrawal rate jumped in the period that also saw regulators increasing their scrutiny over cryptocurrency trading platforms. For instance, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned Binance — the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume — from operating regulated activity in the country “without the prior written consent.”On Monday, Barclays notified its clients that they could no longer transfer funds to Binance, citing the FCA’s order. However, the London-based bank said clients could withdraw funds from Binance to their banking accounts.Earlier on Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China also took action against a local company for allegedly trading cryptocurrencies on the side of their regular business activities. Beijing had effectively prohibited all kinds of cryptocurrency-related activities in May, effectively forcing the world’s largest crypto mining community in its regions to either shut down or move their operations abroad.Generally, a run-up in Bitcoin withdrawal rates is seen as traders’ intention to hold the cryptocurrency instead of trading it for other assets, including rival cryptocurrencies and fiat money. Therefore, with overall BTC withdrawals hitting a one-year high, expectations remain higher as Bitcoin is preparing for another upside run on the so-called “hodling” sentiment.Nope. Looks like retail is back and #HODLing!But the total Bitcoin reserves held by exchanges have remained relatively stable since May, indicating that the latest spike in withdrawals has had little impact on the overall exchange balance as of Wednesday.It’s worth noting that exchanges’ BTC balances can differ greatly based on their geographical dominance.For instance, trading platforms having association with China and Chinese traders reported declines in their Bitcoin balances. They include Binance, whose BTC reserves dropped by 7,214.97 units in the last week, and Huobi, which processed withdrawals of 4,398.63 BTC in the same timeframe. OKEx BTC balances dropped by a mere 1,357.53 BTC.However, United States-based Kraken added 6,751.98 BTC to its vaults, the highest among the non-Chinese exchanges, in the previous seven days, while Coinbase’s reserves increased by 168.88 BTC.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

270,"Iran’s challenge with the ever-increasing electricity consumption has reached new heights, leading the country to halt electricity exports.Abuzer Salihi, general manager of Iran’s electricity distribution company Tevanir, announced on state television that it has reduced electricity exports to zero “so that there is no problem in electricity supply in the country.” He said that the electricity supply to Afghanistan’s Herat province, which imported 70% of its electricity from Iran, completely stopped in order to meet domestic needs.According to the numbers shared by Tevanir, the daily electricity demand reached over 65,000 megawatts, while production is around 54,000 megawatts. Aside from the summer heat, Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto mining activities in the country — known for its significant electricity subsidies for the local industry — are listed as one cause of the high power demand.Iran made crypto mining legal in 2019 to license and regulate miners within the country. But the country has also seen a spike in unlicensed mining activities, with many unlicensed miners using the residential electric grid to power up energy-consuming mining rigs.Iran’s first measure this year was to fine crypto miners using household energy.A ban on mining until the hot summer months pass followed. Announced by President Hassan Rouhani in May, the crypto mining ban will last until September to ensure access to electricity for domestic consumption. Rouhani also claimed that 85% of the mining activity in Iran is unlicensed.Related: Proposed bill in Iran could ban all foreign-mined cryptocurrenciesAs a last resort before halting electricity exports, the country also called on all legally operating crypto miners to stop their activities. Eshaq Jahangiri, the first vice president of Iran under Rouhani, made the announcement during a meeting with officials of the Ministry of Energy. “We will ensure that the electricity will not be cut off in essential and important places,” he said.Meanwhile, Iran continues its crackdown on illegal mining activities. Last month, authorities confiscated more than 7,000 mining rigs at a farm operating in the capital of Tehran"
271,"Russian lawmakers are working on new legislation that would allow the government to confiscate cryptocurrencies, according to a senior official.Russian Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov claimed that the government is now developing a set of amendments to the country’s criminal code to allow authorities to seize crypto obtained from illegal activity, local news agency TASS reported.Speaking at a conference of prosecutors’ offices of European countries on Wednesday, Krasnov stressed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) have been increasingly used for corruption and bribery. The official said that cryptocurrency is also a tool for laundering embezzled budget funds.“The criminal usage of cryptocurrencies poses a serious challenge in our country,” Krasnov said. He claimed that Russia’s adopted crypto law “On Digital Financial Assets” (DFA) has played a crucial role in tackling this problem, but new criminal code amendments would bring additional protection. “This would allow the application of restrictive measures and confiscation of virtual assets,” Krasnov stated.According to some local industry experts, no amount of legislation would make it possible for the government to actually seize crypto assets. Nikita Soshnikov, a former senior lawyer at Deloitte CIS and director of Alfacash, told Cointelegraph that it is “obvious that digital assets kept in wallets would be impossible to confiscate like any other type of assets.” “However, there is already one landmark case where FSB officers were found guilty for accepting bribes, and the court formally seized 0.1 and 4.70235 BTC as state revenue,” he noted.Soshnikov said that Russia started developing proposals for confiscating crypto back in 2019, years before the DFA law was adopted. “The Prosecutor General’s Office remains the key stakeholder of this project, and in such context, the current statement is a mere confirmation of agreed plans,” he added.Related: Russian officials consider partial lift on crypto payment banFormerly a deputy chairman of Russia’s investigative committee, Krasnov became the country’s prosecutor general in early 2020. Since the appointment, Krasnov has been a vocal opponent of crypto. Last year, he claimed that cybercrime in Russia is often facilitated through crypto and has seen a 25-fold increase since 2015. Last October, Krasnov said that Russian civil servants would be required to declare crypto assets on an equal basis with other assets.Krasnov’s renewed efforts to fight crypto-enabled corruption in Russia come months after United States President Joe Biden’s administration sanctioned him for prosecuting Russian opposition and anti-corruption leader Alexei Navalny. According to local investigations, Krasnov has himself been involved in some controversy related to corruption."
272,"Bitcoin (BTC) miner revenue jumped after the network saw its biggest-ever difficulty drop, data shows. According to figures from monitoring resource Blockchain.com, daily revenues have surged by over 50%.Bitcoin mining is currently in a unique state of flux — around half of the hashing power is offline as miners relocate from China, and it remains unknown how quickly they will be able to come back online.At the same time, those miners unaffected by the Chinese rout have seen half their competitors disappear overnight, and profitability has gone up as a result.With data now coming in for the past few weeks, the scale of the changes is plain to see. Daily mining revenue was around $20.7 million on Friday, the day before the difficulty adjustment. A day later, it hit $29.3 million, and by Tuesday this week — $31.9 million.This is all a consequence of a “very interesting dynamic,” analytics firm Glassnode summarized in a video guide to this week’s edition of its newsletter, “The Week On-chain.”“We have a very interesting dynamic where approximately 50% of the hash power is currently offline and incurring a great number of costs due to logistics and just simply not hashing, having hardware that’s not currently working, and the other 50% has essentially seen half their competition drop off the network,” it explained.For active miners, profitability has reverted to around the levels seen when BTC/USD traded at $55,000–$60,000.The result has been felt not just by miners. Average block times hit their highest levels ever over the past week, Glassnode added, beaten only during Bitcoin’s “bootstrapping” period in 2009–2010, before the cryptocurrency even had a solid price in United States dollars.Other on-chain metrics likewise record the dichotomy between different groups of miners.Related: An even bigger mining difficulty drop? 5 things to watch in Bitcoin this weekThese show, among other things, how some are spending treasuries due to relocation costs while being unable to mine new coins and receive a share of block rewards and fees.At the same time, others have been holding on to more BTC per block than they are spending — part of an uptrend that continues despite the drop in price, which has also reached over 50%.“This is certainly one to watch,” Glassnode advised."
273,"Amid intensifying concerns over Binance’s global regulatory issues, the company’s CEO and founder, Changpeng Zhao, has underscored the exchange’s commitment to cooperating with regulators.In an open letter on Tuesday, Zhao emphasized that the cryptocurrency industry has massively evolved over the past four years since Binance’s launch, while there is still a lot of regulatory uncertainty around crypto.In response to the growing regulatory “hyper-focus,” the CEO shared Binance’s key principles, including its willingness to work with financial authorities in order to be a “positive contributor.”Zhao said that the crypto industry still lacks clear regulatory frameworks in several countries, noting that “more regulations are, in fact, positive signs that an industry is maturing.” The executive elaborated that clear regulations provide a foundation for adoption as more people feel safe to participate in crypto, adding:Zhao reiterated Binance’s commitment to partnering with regulators and the company’s approach to handling the growing popularity of its platform, including active hiring and placing more systems and processes to protect their users.The CEO mentioned that Binance has grown its international compliance team and advisory board by 500% since 2020, including appointments from major global regulators such as the Financial Action Task Force. Zhao noted that Binance has been actively implementing Anti-Money Laundering policies on its platform, cooperating with crypto intelligence firm CipherTrace to ensure further protection.“We are learning and improving every day,” Zhao wrote, outlining Binance’s ultimate goal as increasing freedom and inclusion for a “better human society.” “We firmly believe that our industry will benefit society through the creation of inclusive financial opportunities,” the CEO concluded. Zhao said that the company welcomes “more constructive guidance” to help the exchange grow better.Related: Binance disappointed by Barclays’ ‘unilateral action’ to block customer paymentsThe news comes as Binance faces major scrutiny from regulators around the world, including authorities in the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, the United States, Thailand and the Cayman Islands.

274,"New York-based crypto loans and savings startup BlockFi launched its Bitcoin (BTC) rewards credit card today. The card is available to select approved customers on the United States waitlist. Officially named BlockFi Rewards Visa Signature Credit Card, the card was first announced at the end of last year by Visa and BlockFi. Available to use anywhere Visa is accepted, the card allows its recipients to earn 1.5% back in Bitcoin instead of airline miles or other cashback rewards. Earned Bitcoin rewards will be transferred to cardholders’ BlockFi Interest Account.Initial reports were saying that the card would have a $200 annual fee. But BlockFi took a U-turn on that decision in May, launching the card with no annual fee. Cardholders are eligible to earn 2% in Bitcoin on annual expenses exceeding over $50,000. For example, if a customer spends $60,000 within a year, they will receive 2% of the $10,000 expenditure in BTC.BlockFi’s credit card also offers familiar perks for the crypto ecosystem, such as trading bonuses and a referral program. The card is issued by Evolve Bank & Trust.Terry Angelos, SVP and global head of fintech at Visa, noted that crypto rewards programs are a compelling way to welcome users to the crypto economy, and Visa is excited to see more examples of them.Related: Institutional exchange launches crypto debit cardAlmost everyone knows cryptocurrencies’ role in reshaping the financial space, said BlockFi co-founder Flori Marquez, adding, “This card will make it easier than ever for people to earn Bitcoin back while making day-to-day purchases.”Visa is a known explorer of cryptocurrencies to broaden the adoption of digital currencies in general. As Cointelegraph analyzed in detail, Visa’s public affirmation of its positive stance toward cryptocurrency payments services reflects its drive to remain a leading player in the global payment network."
275,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) second-quarter price battering has pundits speculating that Tesla may have to report a loss of up to $100 million for Q2.With the price of Bitcoin recently dropping to revisit levels last seen in January, CNBC business analyst Kate Rooney asserted on Tuesday that Tesla may face an “impairment charge” — requiring it to report the drawdown in a disclosure to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.She noted that as Tesla first disclosed its $1.5 billion in Bitcoin purchases in February, and onlookers believe the electric vehicle manufacturer may have been underwater at the end of the quarter. “Tesla holds crypto as an intangible asset and because of accounting rules, when Bitcoin’s value drops below a certain amount, companies have to mark that down in their financial statements,” Rooney said, adding:The analyst claimed that unnamed sources estimate the impairment charge could result in a loss of between $25 million and $100 million for Tesla on paper.However, Rooney added that Tesla also cannot mark up the price of the BTC it holds until the position is realized in the form of a sale.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become a highly polarizing figure to the crypto community in recent months, with the firm’s Bitcoin investment and support for BTC payments helping ignite rallies into new all-time highs for the asset.However, a combination of Tesla suspending BTC payments over concerns regarding the environmental impact of mining and Musk’s persistent Twitter-based Dogecoin proselytizing, the business magnate has fallen out of favor with much of the crypto community.Roughly 11 hours ago as of this writing, Reddit user u/StablecoinsFraud posted a screenshot of a tweet they claimed Musk deleted after it pushed up BTC prices. “Elon Musk has deleted a post he posted last night that pumped the Bitcoin price. Someone in his ear?” they wrote."
276,"Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients on Tuesday that the blockchain with the highest “real use potential” is Ethereum, suggesting its Ether (ETH) could become the dominant digital store of value.As such, Goldman predicts the total market capitalization of Ether could overtake the total market cap for Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming years, according to a report in Business Insider. Smart contracts comprise software enabling the automated execution of digital contracts, with the technology having facilitated the boom in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and crypto-powered decentralized applications (DApps).The analysts noted that Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage had given it the stronger brand. However, they believe it lacks some of the use cases of Ether and lags in transaction speeds. As a result of its focus on hard money and network security, Bitcoin does not yet offer the same level of functionality as Ethereum.As a younger network, Ethereum has also been able to grow at a faster rate than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin grew 261% in the past year, ETH was up by 856% in the same period.Despite tipping Ether over Bitcoin, the analysts also argue gold is a superior store of value to digital assets, characterizing gold as a “defensive inflation hedge” and crypto as a “risk-on inflation hedge.”The note comes the month after analysts from Goldman Sachs’ Investment Strategy Group told clients that crypto isn’t even an “investable” asset class. The analysts said:Banks aren’t the only ones who’ve noticed Ethereum overtake Bitcoin in some substantial way. The founder and CEO of the Celsius Network, a crypto depository and lending company with $17 billion in digital assets under management, told Kitco News on Monday that Ether has already eclipsed Bitcoin in terms of holdings among the platform’s users and believed it would do so in the wider world in 2022 or 2023.Disclaimer.

277,"The weekend rally in cryptocurrencies was led by Bitcoin (BTC) but this move was not supported by huge trading volumes. According to on-chain analysts at CryptoQuant, the low trading volume suggests that “whales are staying low without much action.”However, Bitcoin has successfully held the $30,000 support for two weeks, which suggests that accumulation is taking place at lower levels. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index rose to 29 on July 5, its highest level in about three weeks. This suggests that aggressive investors may have started bottom fishing.If bulls successfully hold the $30,000 level in Bitcoin for a few more days, trading interest is likely to increase further. Institutional investors usually do not buy in a falling market and wait until prices stabilize. Once that happens, the volume is likely to pick up and a stronger recovery may be expected.However, if support levels crack, the sentiment will sour further and institutions may prefer to remain on the sidelines until a bottom is confirmed. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies and spot the critical support levels on the downside.The bulls pushed Bitcoin above the 20-day exponential moving average ($34,851) on July 4 but they could not clear the hurdle at the 50-day simple moving average ($36,338). This suggests that bears continue to sell on rallies.If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA going forward, the bears will try to pull the BTC/USDT pair to the $31,000 support. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just below the midpoint signal that there is a balance between supply and demand.This balance will shift in favor of the bears if they can sink the price below $31,000. That could result in a drop to the $28,000 support. If this level cracks, the pair could witness panic selling.Conversely, if the price rises from the current level or rebounds off $31,000, the bulls will make one more attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at $36,670. If they manage to do that, the pair may rally to the overhead resistance zone at $41,330 to $42,451.67.Ether (ETH) is stuck between the moving averages. This shows that bears are attempting to defend the 50-day SMA ($2,410) and the bulls are trying to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,196).However, this tight-range trading is unlikely to continue for long. If bulls push the price above the 50-day SMA, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the downtrend line. This level may again act as a resistance but if crossed, the next stop could be $2,990.05.Conversely, if bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $2,000. This is an important support because a break below it will invalidate the short-term bullish view. The pair may then slide to the critical support at $1,728.74.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.Binance Coin (BNB) is facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($308) but the positive sign is that the bulls are not giving up much ground. This suggests that buyers anticipate the altcoin to make an upward dash.If bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($341). The bears may try to stall the recovery at this resistance but if the bulls can absorb the supply, the pair could start its journey to $433.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to push the price above the 20-day EMA, short-term traders may close their positions. If the pair breaks below $264.26, a retest of the support at $211.70 may be on the cards.Cardano (ADA) broke above the 20-day EMA ($1.39) on July 3 but the bulls could not drive the price above the 50-day SMA ($1.51). This suggests that bears are in no mood to relent and they continue to sell on rallies.If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the traders who bought during the recent relief rally may bail out of their positions. This could pull the price down to $1.20. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will make one more attempt to clear the hurdle at the 50-day SMA.If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could start its journey toward $1.94. Conversely, if bears sink the price below $1.20, the pair could retest the critical support at $1. A break below this level will be a huge negative and may start a new downtrend.Dogecoin (DOGE) had been trading near the 20-day EMA ($0.26) for the past few days but the bulls could not push the price above it. This suggests that bears aggressively defended this resistance.The bulls seem to have given up and are closing their position today. If the bears sink the price below $0.21, the selling could intensify further and the DOGE/USDT pair may retest the critical support at $0.15.The gradually downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 41 indicate advantage to the bears. The selling could pick up momentum below $0.15, which could result in a drop to $0.10.This negative view will invalidate if the price rebounds off $0.21 and breaks above the 20-day EMA.In a downtrend, the bears aggressively defend the 20-day EMA ($0.70) and that is what has happened in XRP. Even after repeated attempts in the past few days, the bulls could not propel the price above the 20-day EMA.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 42 suggest that bears are in command. If bears sink the price below $0.63, XRP/USDT pair could drop to $0.58 and then to the critical support at $0.50.This bearish view will be negated if the price rebounds off the support and rises above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will clear the path for a rally to the 50-day SMA where the bears may again pose a stiff challenge.Polkadot (DOT) has been trading in a tight range between $13 and $16.93 for the past few days. A tight consolidation near the support is a negative sign as it shows that the bulls are not able to overcome the supply and push the price higher.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI has turned down from 41, suggesting that bears are in control. If the sellers sink the price below $13, the DOT/USDT pair could witness sharp selling, which may pull the price down to $10 and then $7.50.On the contrary, if the bulls again defend the $13 support, the pair could extend its stay inside the tight range for a few more days. A breakout and close above $16.93 will be the first indication that demand exceeds supply.Uniswap (UNI) broke above the 20-day EMA ($19.53) on July 4 but the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above it. This suggests that bears are trying to trap the aggressive bulls.However, the flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint indicate that the selling pressure is reducing. If the bulls do not allow the price to sustain below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned positive and the buyers are accumulating on dips.That will increase the possibility of a break above the 50-day SMA ($22.65). If that happens, the UNI/USDT pair could start its northward march to $25 and then $27. Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks below $16.93, the pair may drop to $15.Related: Stablecoin growth could affect credit markets, rating agency warnsEven after repeated attempts in the past few days, the bulls have not been able to push Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the overhead resistance at $538.11. This suggests that bears are unwilling to let go of their advantage.The 20-day EMA ($526) has started to turn down and the RSI has slipped below 43, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the downside.The sellers will now try to pull the price below the immediate support at $475.69. If they succeed, the BCH/USDT pair could drop to $428.43 and then to $370.This negative view will be nullified if the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off the support and rises above $538.11. If that happens, the pair could extend its relief rally to $650.35 and then to $735.53.The bulls could not push Litecoin (LTC) above the 20-day EMA ($144) on July 4, which suggests that bears are aggressively defending this resistance.The price has turned down from the 20-day EMA today. If bears pull the price below $130.60, the LTC/USDT pair could retest the critical support at $118. If this level also breaks down, the pair will complete a descending triangle pattern, opening the doors for a down move to $100 and then $70.This bearish view will be invalidated if the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off the support and breaks above the downtrend line of the triangle. Such a move could create an opening for an up-move to $200.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

278,"Bitcoin (BTC) might have tested the $40,000 support in mid-July, but according to various derivatives metrics, there has not been a significant change in investor optimism. This situation either means that price is not what they are looking for to mark the end of the current bear market or that most traders are still underwater at $40,000.One of the best measures of optimism is the futures market premium, which measures the gap between longer-term contracts and the current spot market levels. In healthy markets, a 5% to 15% annualized premium is expected. However, during bearish markets, this indicator fades or turns negative, a situation known as ""backwardation"" — and an alarming red flag.According to the chart above, the one-month futures contract has been unable to sustain an annualized premium above 5% since June 18. There have even been some periods of backwardation, including the most recent one on July 5.There is, of course, the possibility that derivatives markets could decouple from regular spot markets. Maybe investors are unwilling to take the exchange risk, as futures contracts require margin deposits.To understand whether the bearish signals seen in derivatives are explicitly tied to these instruments, one should analyze spot market volumes. Typically, bearish markets will present lower trading activity a couple of weeks after the price crash.As predicted, the traded volume peaked in late May but decreased by more than half a couple of weeks later. Although this cannot be deemed a bearish indicator by itself, it expresses a lack of interest in trading at the current levels.This movement might happen when buyers are scared and, as a result, place scaling bids below market levels, or when sellers have been exhausted. Unfortunately, there's no way to know until a decent amount of volume trades outside of the $650 billion market capitalization area.However, there's another way to gauge professional traders' optimism. The 25% delta skew compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options. When fear is prevalent, the metric will turn positive as the protective put options premium is higher than similar risk call options.The opposite holds when market makers are bullish, causing the 25% delta skew indicator to shift to the negative area.A 25% delta skew ranging from -10% to +10% is usually deemed neutral. However, the indicator has been above such a range since June 30, indicating fear from arbitrage desks and market markets.The last time this indicator showed a bullish sentiment was on April 14, the exact day of the $64,900 all-time high.Considering that none of the derivatives indicators showed signs of bullishness even as Bitcoin's price held above $40,000 on June 15, there is reason to believe that investors are not comfortable opening long positions right now. It remains to be seen what will trigger a sentiment change, but it will certainly take more than a single 10% rally.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

279,"Following their longest streak of selling since February 2018, institutional managers became net buyers of digital asset funds last week, offering cautious optimism that the crypto market was turning a corner after a period of significant volatility. Inflows into digital asset funds devoted to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and others totaled $63 million in the week ended July 2, CoinShares said in its latest report. For the first time in nine weeks, inflows were registered across all individual digital assets with dedicated funds.Funds devoted to Bitcoin saw $38.9 million in weekly inflows, bringing the year-to-date total to $4.186 billion. CoinShares revised the previous week’s total to reflect a small increase in net investments.Ether funds registered $17.7 million in weekly inflows, bringing their year-to-date total to $960 million and snapping three consecutive weekly outflows.Funds investing in Polkadot and XRP saw inflows of $2.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively.While multi-asset funds saw positive weekly inflows, the total was much smaller than in previous weeks, a sign that investors were cycling back into Bitcoin.Grayscale, the world’s largest digital asset manager, reported last week that its total assets under management reached $29.8 billion. Some analysts are concerned that crypto markets could experience headwinds in the coming weeks after Grayscale’s GBTC lock-up expires, allowing investors to sell the shares.07/02/21 UPDATE: Net Assets Under Management, Holdings per Share, and Market Price per Share for our Investment Products.

280,"In this article, I intend to discuss the importance of market data, decentralized finance (DeFi) econometrics and applied DeFi research on crypto (and digital) assets as a corollary to financial econometrics and applied research. I will also attempt to draw upon the perspective and findings from Eugene Fama’s seminal papers based on his interest in measuring the statistical properties of stock prices and resolving the debate between technical analysis (the use of geometric patterns in price and volume charts to forecast future price movements of a security) and fundamental analysis (the use of accounting and economic data to determine a security’s fair value). Nobel laureate Fama operationalized the efficient market hypothesis — summarized compactly in the epigram that “prices fully reflect all available information” in efficient markets. So, let’s focus on this information around crypto and digital assets, on crypto and decentralized finance data sources, market data analysis, and everything that surrounds the massive emerging DeFi industry that is essential for attracting institutional investors to crypto, DeFi and broader “token” markets, in general.In most markets, market data is defined as the price of an instrument (an asset, security, commodity, etc.) and trade-related data. This data reflects market and asset class volatility, volume and trade-specific data, such as open, high, low, close, volume (OHLCV) and other value-added data, such as order book data (bid-ask spread, aggregated market depth, etc.) and pricing and valuation (reference data, traditional finance data like first exchange rates, etc.) This market data is instrumental in various financial econometric, applied finance and, now, DeFi research such as:Although applying a traditional methodology to evaluate risk and discern varying degrees of opportunity spread across diverse and emerging crypto-asset classes may be limiting, it is a start. New valuation models have emerged that aim to make sense of these digital assets that have ascended to dominate the truly global digital marketplaces, and even these models need market data. Some of these models include but are not limited to:Therefore, market data becomes central to all the modeling and analysis tools for making sense of markets, and also for performing correlation analyses between various crypto sectors such as layer one, layer two, Web 3.0 and DeFi. The primary source of this crypto market data comes from the ever-growing and fragmented mix of crypto exchanges. The data from these exchanges cannot be widely trusted, as we have seen instances of inflated volumes through practices such as wash trading and closed pools that can distort the price by misrepresenting demand and volume. So, modeling a hypothesis based on empirical data and subsequently testing the hypothesis to formulate an investment theory (insights from empirical abstracts) can be tricky. This gives rise to oracles that aim to resolve the issues of trusted data coming into the blockchain transaction system or a mediation layer between the crypto and traditional finance layers.Related: Oracle wants to bring blockchain to the masses through a crypto-secure data offeringBlockchain, the underlying technology that governs all crypto assets and networks, touts its fundamental tenets of trade, trust and ownership on the basis of transparency extended by trust systems (or consensus), so why is market data such a huge issue? Isn’t it part of the ethos of blockchain and the crypto industry to rely on data that belongs to the market and is easily accessible for analysis?The answer is “Yes! But!” Things get interesting when we intersect the crypto markets with fiat-based liquidity — U.S. dollar-, euro-, yen- and British pound-denominated transactions are the rail to traditional finance that is being facilitated by crypto exchanges.As Peter Tchir, head of global macro at New York-based Academy Securities, explains in an article written by Simon Constable: “Global macro is a term for underlying trends that are so large that they could lift or drop the economy or vast chunks of the securities markets.” Constable added:I would like to distinguish between global macro and crypto macro. While global-macro trends — such as inflation, money supply and other macro events — impact global demand and supply curves, crypto macro governs the correlation between the various sectors (such as Web 3.0, layer one, layer two, DeFi and nonfungible tokens), tokens that are representative of those sectors and events that impact the corresponding movement of these asset classes.Related: How NFTs, DeFi and Web 3.0 are intertwinedCrypto (and digital) asset classes define a whole new realm of asset creation, transaction and asset movement when confined to fungibility between asset classes and exchange mechanisms, such as loans, collateral and exchanges. This creates a macro environment underpinned by crypto-economic principles and theories. When we attempt to link these two major macroeconomic environments for either injecting or transferring liquidity from one economic system to another, we essentially complicate our measurement metrics and market data, due to a collision of value systems.Let me demonstrate the complexity with an example of the importance of market data and other factors in formulating an investment theory based on insights from empirical abstracts.While layer one provides an important utility for many ecosystems that emerge on layer-one networks, not all layer-one networks are created equal and do not provide the same discerning value and characteristics. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, had the first-move advantage and is sort of the face of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It started as a utility but has morphed into a store of value and an asset class as an inflation hedge attempting to displace gold.Ether (ETH), on the other hand, came up with the notion of programmability (the ability to apply conditions and rules) to value movement, thereby creating rich ecosystems such as DeFi and NFTs. So, ETH becomes the utility token that powers these ecosystems facilitating co-creation. The rise in transaction activity pushed the demand for Ether, as it is needed for transaction processing.Bitcoin as a store of value and an inflation hedge is quite different from an ever-growing and emerging business on a layer-one network. It is hence vital to understand what gives these tokens value. It is the utility of a token as a toll on the network that makes it valuable, or its ability to store and transfer (large) value in near time giving it an advantage over existing value movement or payment systems.In either case, the utility, transaction volume, circulating supply and related transaction metrics provide insights into the token valuation. If we were to analyze and look into the deeper macroeconomic impact on valuation (such as interest rates, money supply, inflation and so forth) and also crypto macro factors involving correlation of other crypto assets and cryptocurrencies that directly or indirectly impact layer one, the resulting theory would include the growth of foundational technology, the roles of native asset classes and maturity premiums. It would be indicative of technology risk and market adoption, network effect and liquidity premium that demonstrate wide acceptance across various crypto-driven ecosystems. An investment view on strategic fit to, say, a crypto portfolio construction includes considerations around macroeconomic cycles, crypto liquidity (the ability to convert crypto assets) and crypto macro impact, and views these as a mid-term low risk on our risk-model framework.Availability of trusted crypto market data enables not only real-time and on-spot trading decisions but also various risk and optimization analyses needed for portfolio construction and analysis. The analysis requires additional traditional market data as we begin to converse with traditional finance-related market cycles and liquidity, which can also attempt to correlate the crypto macro sectors with global macro sectors. This can get quickly complicated from a modeling perspective, simply due to the disparity between the diversity and velocity of market data between two value systems.As fundamental as crypto market efficiency is to good financial decision-making, it is poorly understood and distorted by poor or inadequate information. It is crypto (economic) market data and various economic models that enable us to make sense of emerging and messy crypto markets. The principles of the efficient market hypothesis — which implies that in efficient markets, price is always reflective of available information — also apply to crypto markets.Market data, therefore, becomes central to all the modeling and analysis tools for making sense of markets and also for performing correlation analyses between various crypto sectors, such as layer one, layer two, Web 3.0 and DeFi. The primary source of this crypto market data comes from the ever-growing and fragmented mix of crypto exchanges. Crypto and digital asset classes define a whole new realm of asset creation, transaction and asset movement, especially when confined to fungibility between asset classes and exchange mechanisms, such as loans, collateral and exchanges.

281,"Marshall Wace, a London-based hedge fund giant managing about $55 billion in assets, is reportedly planning a major move into cryptocurrency and blockchain investment.The hedge fund firm is preparing to launch a dedicated portfolio, targeting investments in the digital asset industry, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.Citing anonymous people familiar with the matter, the report notes that the new initiative will focus on investing in privatelyowned digital finance companies working in areas like blockchain technology and payments systems for digital currencies and stablecoins.It is believed that Marshall Wace’s new digital finance portfolio will be headed by Amit Rajpal, chief executive of Marshall Wace Asia and co-founder of Indian fintech firm Niyogin.According to the report, the portfolio will adopt a similar approach to a newly launched healthcare fund, first targeting investments in firms before flotation, then holding on to them after they list. People familiar with the matter reportedly said that the portfolio will focus on late-stage venture capital investments and the infrastructure around stablecoins.Related: $22B hedge fund Point72 reportedly searching for a ‘head of crypto’The hedge fund firm is reportedly still discussing the size of the new portfolio with potential investors.

282,"MicroStrategy CEO and Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor recently featured in an interview to share his insights into the global macro environment alongside Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto in general. Speaking about the risks related to volatility, Saylor said, “The people that invest in Bitcoin as traders — and they don’t, they don’t have a technology view or the macro view — they’re always going to be disappointed because of volatility.”Matching the advice of seasoned crypto traders, Saylor cautioned viewers to invest (in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies) only as much as they can afford to lose. The American entrepreneur also warned investors to neither make impulsive trades based on speculations nor give investment advice to fellow traders who intend short-term returns.On the other hand, the entrepreneur believes that regulatory complications currently stand as the biggest threat to the crypto economy.Related: 44% of investors expect Bitcoin to drop below $30K in 2021: CNBC surveyAs the stronger fiat currencies, such as the United States dollar and euro keep on printing, Saylor speculated that Bitcoin will only become stronger, concluding:A recent survey of a small group of Bitcoin investors found that 44% of the investors reportedly expect Bitcoin’s price to settle down under $30,000, while 56% foresee a resumption of the bull run."
283,"Bithumb’s Hong Kong affiliates are reportedly facing a civil suit for breach of contract.According to a Tuesday report by the Korea Times, the suit is being initiated by a former Bithumb partner in Thailand, which is accusing the South Korean-headquartered exchange of unilaterally halting its business in Thailand and causing major losses.The Thai firm — which remains unnamed — is reportedly preparing to file a lawsuit against Bithumb’s Hong Kong subsidiaries, including Bithumb Global Holdings and GBEX, as well as top company executives in July.According to the plaintiff firm, Bithumb’s Hong Kong-based entities were allegedly involved in the company’s previous plans to open a Bithumb exchange in Thailand. Some of the executives of these subsidiaries also hold high-level positions at Bithumb Korea, the plaintiff reportedly said.After founding an entity in Thailand back in 2018, Bithumb reportedly backed off on its plans in the country, allegedly causing significant damages to its Thailand partner. The plaintiff claims that Bithumb did not have any real intention to establish a crypto exchange in Thailand and that it attempted to sell its BXA coins by exaggerating the size of its global presence.“After Bithumb stopped its BXA coin business, its Thai operation became unnecessary, so the company ended its business in Thailand unilaterally, causing serious damage to us,” the former Thai partner said. A spokesman for the firm noted that Bithumb Global Holdings and GBEX collectively own a 49% stake in the joint venture in Thailand and are fully-owned subsidiaries of Bithumb Korea.The plaintiff elaborated that they decided to file lawsuits against Bithumb’s Hong Kong entities, as they are related to the Thailand issues more directly than other Bithumb subsidiaries. Related: Bithumb to ban employees from trading crypto on its platformThe firm added that the company is considering filing a separate similar lawsuit on behalf of Bithumb’s former partner in Japan as well.Bithumb did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. As previously reported, Bithumb has been involved in legal controversy over promoting its BXA token, which has never been launched or listed. Through BXA token sales, Lee Jung-hoon, chairperson of the board at Bithumb Korea and Bithumb Holdings, allegedly became involved in a major fraud causing investor damages of up to $25 million. Last year, South Korean authorities reportedly conducted multiple raids of Bithumb’s offices as part of a related investigation and a court action."
284,"Bitcoin (BTC) topping out at $64,500 would mean that this bull market is unlike any other in history, one commentator argues.In a tweet on Tuesday, Alex Saunders, founder and CEO of Nuggets News, used a classic Wall Street paradigm to suggest that BTC’s price is far from its macro top.Bitcoin has so far failed to crack resistance even at $40,000, languishing 50% below its recent all-time highs. As fear lingers as the driving force behind market sentiment, many are concerned that bullish momentum cannot compete with recent bearish price events.Chief among them is the forced miner migration out of China. With months set to pass before the hash rate recovers, even the most tried-and-tested Bitcoin price models are being stretched to their limits.For Saunders, however, China’s move to “go for the kill” when it comes to Bitcoin’s health has already failed to produce its intended result.“In 9 years I’ve never seen a bull market end in disbelief. Consensus is sideways & 1 more leg down,” he summarized.Saunders referred to the classic market cycle paradigm in which “disbelief” precedes a dramatic price run-up in a given market. After a comedown from a macro high, “disbelief” likewise signals a reawakening after a protracted period of losses.His comments came as fresh comments from the People’s Bank of China reiterated previous negative sentiment on cryptocurrency, warning banks not to allow transactions associated with the industry.Unlike last time, however, the news had barely any impact on Bitcoin price action.He is far from alone in his belief that Bitcoin has not seen its highs in this halving cycle. Supporting him is stock-to-flow model creator PlanB, who is eyeing a minimum BTC/USD price of $135,000 by the end of 2021.As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, signs that the worst of China’s mining crackdown is already over are already visible in Bitcoin network fundamentals.The hash rate has bounced off its recent lows, while difficulty is busy accounting for the biggest reshuffling in mining power that Bitcoin has ever seen.This may nonetheless mean that difficulty sees an even bigger drop at the next readjustment in just under two weeks’ time. Thereafter, the added miner presence resulting from increased profitability should allow the network to complete its automated balancing act."
285,"A crypto payments gateway says that it now makes it easy for online merchants in Africa to accept Bitcoin at the checkout.Paychant says its tool can be easily integrated into websites, WooCommerce, Magento, PrestaShop and an array of other online stores with a single line of code.This gives retailers access to a growing number of consumers who want to pay using cryptocurrencies.According to Paychant, its infrastructure is simple, secure and convenient — and is geared toward small and large businesses alike. Nonprofit organizations can also accept crypto donations with ease. Customizable widgets are offered that can be embedded directly into a fundraising campaign’s website with little fuss.Beyond its straightforward widgets, Paychant also enables users to request money from friends, family and business contacts around the world. An intuitive billing feature means invoices can be generated directly from a custom-built dashboard, and the startup’s infrastructure empowers merchants with the tools they need to set up their very own e-commerce store.The volatility of cryptocurrencies can be something of a concern for merchants. However, Paychant says it counters this by enabling payments made in digital assets to be instantly converted into cash — offering all-important protection when there are fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin. Payouts can also be made to a merchant’s bank account on a daily basis.These tools are complemented by a simple yet robust dashboard that delivers a crystal-clear insight of the funds coming in and out. Transaction data can be exported with a click of a button, and elegantly designed charts provide an at-a-glance insight into how a business is performing.Explaining why its infrastructure is needed, Paychant argues that card payments are expensive and slow — eating into razor-thin profit margins. By contrast, embracing crypto as a payment method can deliver low fees while eliminating the risk of chargebacks.Paychant told Cointelegraph: “As digital currencies have shown to be the most reliable means for frictionless cross-border payments, facilitating fast transactions with low fees in Africa, Paychant is making it easier for businesses to accept crypto payments online or receive crypto donations with a single line of code.”MORE INSIGHTS FROM PAYCHANT HEREPaychant began in 2019, and the project’s founders were inspired to take action after encountering difficulties when trying to receive cross-border payments from clients abroad.The startup joined Celo’s virtual accelerator program last year — and during the eight-week program, its passionate team built a decentralized web wallet that allowed CELO and cUSD to be stored, sent and received on the Celo blockchain.That partnership remains in place today, and both of these digital assets have been embraced alongside Bitcoin, Ether and Tether — giving businesses and individuals new opportunities.As well as giving the business community a helping hand, Paychant wants to make cross-border remittances far less expensive than they are now. The project cites research that suggests sending $200 in sub-Saharan Africa attracts fees of 9.4% — substantially higher than the global average of 7.1%.Over a 10-month period, Paychant says it has processed 15,000 transactions for more than 5,000 merchants in Nigeria. What’s more, it has also rolled out an all-in-one platform that enables crypto users to purchase everything from airtime and internet data to airline tickets and TV subscriptions using virtual currencies.Looking ahead to the next 12 months, the project says that it is determined to expand to Francophone countries across Africa.Learn more about PaychantDisclaimer.

286,"China’s crackdown on Bitcoin (BTC) mining continues to face determined responses across the crypto ecosystem. One of the first BTC exchange operators and co-founder of Zap Protocol, Nick Spanos, said that the crackdown only proves Bitcoin is an unstoppable machine “if the world’s second-biggest economy can’t crush, devalue and manipulate Bitcoin.”Noting that the crackdown is increasing scarcity due to there being fewer miners relative to the transaction volume, Spanos underscored the increase in miners’ profits while the mining difficulty continues to decrease. He explained:Spanos said miners moving out of China will seek to find a place with immediate neighbors, such as Kazakhstan, Iran and Russia. “Others in the region would also be well-served to seize this opportunity,” he added. Recently, one of the major mining groups operating in China announced its plans to move out of the country and distribute its mining operations among the United Arab Emirates, Canada, the United States, Kazakhstan and Iceland.Spanos noted that Bitcoin’s price has always gone up once regulatory setbacks are “digested by the community.” Last week, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz saw “a big net positive” for Bitcoin in China’s crackdown attempt. He said that the market crash from an all-time high followed by high volatility was a successful test for the crypto ecosystem as a whole."

In order to receive the KYC 1 level verification, users will be required to identity document and facial recognition, while KYC 2 level requires an additional proof of address, a Bybit spokesperson noted. Businesses have one KYC verification level with a 100 BTC limit. A representative from Bybit said that the exchange is introducing KYC in anticipation of its spot exchange and a hot wallet launch in order to enable the ""most secure experience"" for users, adding:Some crypto enthusiasts subsequently suggested that Bybit’s new KYC policies would negatively impact the exchange’s trading volumes. “Bybit volume will dry up.

289,"Bitcoin (BTC) headed toward a key Wyckoff level on Tuesday as BTC price action got traders excited about an altcoin surge.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD trading up 4.6% versus the previous day’s lows on Tuesday.After seeing tests of $33,000 support, bulls won out overnight, sending Bitcoin higher. Now, a key area to watch is $36,000, popular analyst Rekt Capital said.According to Wyckoff analysis, a popular method for charting BTC price action, $36,000 marks the likely end of a “phase C” and the beginning of a “phase D” for BTC/USD — with trajectory favoring the upside.“BTC dips to the ~$33000 area and holds the orange Higher Low perfectly,” Rekt Capital commented alongside a chart on the day.As Cointelegraph reported, potential higher targets currently include an unfilled CME futures gap above $46,500. This would be a significant move if it were to happen, as Bitcoin would effectively exit a trading range, in which it has been sitting for multiple weeks.Trader Filbfilb offered a more sobering view. Bears, he warned, were still in command of levels that have attracted the highest volumes — to so-called “point of control” or POC.“Trend remains down,” he summarized on Monday before the bounce higher.Conditions, meanwhile, may be right for altcoins to benefit more than Bitcoin in the mid term. Related: Ethereum price can gain 40% on Bitcoin, argues analyst as London fork nearsIn an atmosphere in which cryptocurrencies broadly “grind up” rather than shoot higher, it may be more than just BTC/USD that forms a point of interest, trader Michaël van de Poppe argued.“Most likely expectation is that altcoins will be grinding up way heavier than Bitcoin in the coming period,” he told Twitter followers on Tuesday.Some of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization woke up overnight, seeing gains that topped 10%. Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin, traded up 3% at $2,340. Meanwhile, many decentralized finance tokens were the standouts over the past 24 hours, namely SUSHI and Aave, which rallied by roughly 20%."
290,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has already started losing its market dominance to Ether (ETH), according to Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky.In a Monday interview with Kitco News, Mashinsky argued that the Ether “flippening,” or the hypothetical scenario in which Ether overtakes Bitcoin as the world’s most valued cryptocurrency, is already happening right now.Mashinsky said that the flippening has already happened on Celsius. “We manage about $17 billion in deposits, or in customer coins, and the number one coin held in dollar terms is Ethereum,” he said.Mashinsky also predicted that Ether will have completely surpassed Bitcoin in terms of market cap by 2022 or 2023:Mashinsky went on to suggest that the main trigger for the upcoming flippening would be the difference between the key use cases of Bitcoin and Ether. According to the CEO, Bitcoin’s primary use case is the store of value, while Ether’s major use case is yield farming, the practice of staking or locking up crypto in return for rewards.“Yield is an application that just has a broader user base. So I think over time you will see a broader adoption of Ethereum than of Bitcoin. But obviously both of them are exceptional applications and exceptional blockchains, and we will see a broad adoption of both, it’s just that one will exceed the other,” Mashinsky stated.Launched in 2018, the Celsius Network is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform, allowing users to earn rewards by transferring their coins to the Celsius wallet and borrow dollars or stablecoins against their crypto collateral. The platform operates its own CEL token that is an ERC-20 coin running on the Ethereum network.Related: Bitcoin’s active addresses fall below Ethereum’s after 60% drop in six weeksBitcoin has emerged as the world’s oldest digital currency and the most valued cryptocurrency, dominating altcoins like Ether in terms of the market cap. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was launched in 2015 and has yet to overtake Bitcoin in terms of market value.At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market — also referred to as Bitcoin dominance — is 44.6%, while Ether’s stands at 18.5%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.Mashinsky is not alone in thinking that Ether will flip Bitcoin in terms of value. Last week, Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Mike Novogratz also predicted that Ether could become the “biggest cryptocurrency one day.”"

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reversing bullish performance at $35,900 to drop just over 5% on the day.The U-turn leaves Bitcoin firmly within its established trading range, with traders mindful of various hurdles to overcome before continuation can take place.For Michaël van de Poppe, these hurdles come in the form of Bitcoin futures gaps.On Friday, CME futures closed the week at around $33,285, a full $2,700 below Sunday’s local high.As a result, the temptation was there for spot price action to fall in order to “fill” the resulting gap between the end of one week’s trading and the start of the next.This is exactly what happened — BTC/USD bounced at around $33,300, hovering at $33,600 at the time of writing.“I’m expecting a corrective move to $33,400 with the CME Gap getting filled, and then we can start continuing,” Van de Poppe said prior to the event taking place.He added that the CME gap higher up at $46,500 is also apt to act as a bullish target should upside enter the picture.“If we get a rally, I’ll not be surprised that we get a rally towards this CME gap in general,” he commented.The past seven days have been broadly kinder to altcoins, meanwhile, with many tokens up versus the same time last week while Bitcoin remains lower.Related: Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, ETH, UNI, ICP, AAVEEther (ETH), the largest altcoin by market capitalization, was in the red on Monday but still up 11% over the course of the week, trading at $2,213.As Cointelegraph reported, Ether’s price is also showing strength against Bitcoin, with ETH/BTC targeting a popular range high of 0.075.Only two of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap saw positive price movements on the day, however, as Bitcoin’s sudden reversal took its toll.Slightly declining Bitcoin dominance provides a potential benefit to altcoins, which tend to perform best during periods of middling BTC action following major dips.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

293,"As the Ukrainian government progresses with cryptocurrency-related legislation, a major local e-bank is preparing to launch a debit card featuring Bitcoin (BTC) trading.Ukrainian online banking application Monobank has completed a pilot integration with a cryptocurrency trading platform, Monobank co-founder Oleg Gorokhovsky announced Monday.According to the executive, the new integration will enable Monobank users to buy and sell Bitcoin with a debit card. Monobank expects to release the new feature later this month pending approval from the National Bank of Ukraine, Gorokhovsky noted.Launched in 2017, Monobank operates under the license of Universal Bank owned by tycoon Sergey Tigipko, a former central bank chief and ex-deputy prime minister of Ukraine. As of August 2020, Monobank’s user base reportedly amassed over 2.5 million customers.Monobank’s Gorokhovsky, who is also a former deputy board chairman at PrivatBank — the largest commercial bank in Ukraine — expressed his optimism about Bitcoin earlier this year. In a Facebook post in February, Gorokhovsky said that Tesla’s $1.5-billion Bitcoin purchase finally convinced him to believe that Bitcoin is here to stay. He also disclosed a substantial personal stake in Bitcoin, predicting that BTC will have hit $100,000 by 2022.Related: Ukraine taps Stellar to develop digital asset infrastructure, including CBDC frameworkUkrainian authorities are steadily progressing with a set of digital currency-related bills.

294,"China’s regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies continues to alienate major miners. Dubai-based investment company IBC Group reportedly plans to end Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) mining operations in China following ban announcements from the different provinces across the country.The group has major mining operations in China and plans to distribute its operations to the United Arab Emirates, Canada, the United States, Kazakhstan, Iceland and various South American countries, according to sources. IBC Group recently relocated its headquarters to Toronto, Canada.Commenting on the crackdown on crypto with a focus on mining activities, IBC Group chairman and iMining CEO Khurram Shroff said it’s a temporary inconvenience. He added that the diversified location of mining facilities is great news for the rest of the world:China turned its attention to the crypto mining industry’s energy consumption following the large-scale power outages in the Chinese mining hub of Xinjiang in mid-April. This was followed by stricter supervision by the government, sending a shockwave through the crypto markets.Related: Expert details the state of crypto in CanadaHowever, experts from the industry have mostly agreed since then that while the initial shakeup will be arduous and challenging, miners’ migration out of China will nurture the decentralization of crypto.Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz saw “a big net positive” for the Bitcoin ecosystem for the long term, while former Gemini security engineer Brandon Arvanaghi stressed, “The crackdown means that Bitcoin is working, not that it’s failing.”"
295,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week in familiar territory after a weekend of solid gains ended in a drawdown — what’s in store?With another rally to near $36,000 under its belt, the largest cryptocurrency is showing signs of strength, but old resistance levels remain in place.The conditions are complex — the ongoing miner migration and associated price action have alarmed many, and Bitcoin’s most accurate forecasting tools are seeing a real test.With fundamentals finally showing signs of life, however, bulls may finally have something to celebrate.Cointelegraph considers five factors at play when it comes to BTC/USD this week.It’s another eerie “Roaring Twenties” style mood on major markets this week thanks to the S&P 500 seeing new all-time highs for seven straight days.Encouraging economic data from the United States plus the Federal Reserve keeping interventions has pushed the equities index ever higher in recent weeks.“Markets are priced for the continuation of a scenario that could not be better constructed,” Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for core investments at Netherlands-based AXA Investment Managers, summarized in a note quoted by Bloomberg.An interesting twist is oil, now at the center of another OPEC+ production row, which is itself gaining but sparking concerns about how much fuel will be available in August.With the U.S. dollar steady, it seems that the equities narrative is the likely driver going forward — this scenario traditionally helping Bitcoin price action.Bitcoin may have seen its biggest-ever difficulty decrease this weekend, but even that may not be enough to steady the ship.At 27.94%, Saturday’s decrease easily beats any that have come before, reflecting the impact of China’s war on mining on the Bitcoin network.According to data from monitoring resource BTC.com, however, the next adjustment may see an even larger drop.As difficulty adjustments can only ever be estimated before they actually take place, and a lot can change over each two-week difficulty period, it is difficult to say just how much the metric needs to decrease to reflect the true state of the network.Given the latest drop, mining is now significantly more economically attractive to many current and potential participants. As such, in the coming 13 days, more miners may well begin operating, increasing the hash rate and thus perhaps mitigating the need to decrease difficulty much further.A look at hash rate activity in recent days shows that a U-turn may have already taken place, with the hash rate spiking above 90 exahashes per second (EH/s) versus lows of 83 EH/s last week.At the time of writing, however, Bitcoin is on track to lower difficulty by another 28.68%.“After yesterday’s record-breaking -27.9% difficulty adjustment, Bitcoin’s difficulty is now similar to the levels after last year’s halving event,” popular Twitter account Dilution-proof noted on Sunday alongside an annotated difficulty chart.The difficulty drop at least had good timing; once in, Bitcoin price action saw a welcome boost and climbed back toward the upper bound of its trading range.Throughout the rest of the weekend, BTC/USD saw little by way of resistance and added around 5% before retracing.What could cap the enthusiasm further? For popular analyst Rekt Capital, two now-infamous moving averages (MAs) may be bears’ best friend in the coming days.As Cointelegraph reported, BTC/USD saw a “death cross” event last month. This refers to the 50-day MA crossing under the 200-day MA, an occurrence that is traditionally regarded as a bearish signal.In reality, “death crosses” have not always led to price losses, but their reputation remains firm this year.Now, current price strength may get a taste of reality should Bitcoin reach either MA, currently floating above spot price.“Once BTC is able to clear $36000... Next major resistance will be the ~$38000 area,” Rekt Capital explained on Sunday, adding a summary chart.Trader Crypto Ed, meanwhile, warned on Monday that the weekend’s ground would ultimately be lost again.“Full retrace coming up,” he said, arguing that the market needed “proper retests” of lower levels in order to fuel a true bullish resurgence.BTC/USD corrected from highs of $35,900 to bounce off $34,000, a level that is still holding at the time of writing.The weekend rally was suspicious for those eyeing one classic market trait — volume.Despite the brisk pace of gains, volume supporting them remained low, and as such, their reliability and ability to sustain themselves was in question from the outset.On Monday, on-chain monitoring service CryptoQuant noted that volumes are still declining, pointing to a lack of interest from major prospective buyers.“BOTH Inflow and outflow are drying out with the trading volume in the market. Seems like the whales are staying low without much actions,” the firm said in a blog post.On Saturday, however, statistician Willy Woo noted an instantaneous uptick in Bitcoin entities holding large amounts of BTC — a classic signal that whales are interested. This followed the downward difficulty adjustment.As Cointelegraph reported, other investor profiles are also getting in on the spare Bitcoin supply, notably the so-called “Rick Astley” type, or hodler of last resort.“Mr Astley is saying ‘shorters gonna get rekt,’” Woo commented alongside additional supporting data.Just how bearish is the average Bitcoin market participant now?That question is traditionally answered by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, and if to believe its readings this week, things may not be all that bad.Related: Is Bitcoin in danger of losing $30K with Grayscale's big GBTC unlocking in two weeks?On Monday, Fear & Greed reached its highest score in nearly three weeks — 29/100. The last time this happened, BTC/USD was on its way to June’s local top above $41,000.Fear & Greed uses a basket of factors to deliver sentiment estimates for cryptocurrency markets and thus helps identify when assets are overbought or oversold at a specific price.Its bullish tops tend to reach 95/100 or more, leaving plenty of room for Bitcoin to grow before “extreme greed” enters and sparks a rout.The index saw lows of 10/100 — “extreme fear” — on June 22 before rebounding."
296,"Bitcoin (BTC) faces the prospects of reaching $47,500-$50,000 based on its current trend's eerie similarity with the one in June through December 2019.In detail, Bitcoin topped out around $14,000 on June 26, 2019, before turning lower for the remainder of the year on profit-taking sentiment, and as well as FUD sparked by the Bitcoin Cash hardfork, Facebook's stand-off with regulators over its crypto project Libra, and then U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's threatening tone on Bitcoin.The flagship cryptocurrency crashed to near $6,500 in December 2019. In doing so, it prompted its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) to flip below its 200-day SMA, a phenomenon that technical chartists call a ""death cross"" and see its formation as a sign of extended sell-offs ahead.But, at the same time, Bitcoin bulls held the price above the 50-week SMA. The cryptocurrency's one-day chart showed bears' attempts to crash the price below its 50-week SMA. But bulls bought those dips every time.Willful buy actions near the 50-week SMA later led to a strong upside rebound towards the 61.8% Fib level that constituted a dropdown Fibonacci retracement graph, drawn from around the $14,000-swing high to approximately the$6,500-swing low.The 2019 fractal also illustrated at least two bullish divergence scenarios, wherein the Bitcoin price formed lower lows while its daily relative strength indicator, a price-momentum oscillator, made lower highs. It hinted weakness in the prevailing bearish momentum. And as it turned out, the price soared later.In 2021, Bitcoin reconstructed the 2019 scenario halfway. At first, the cryptocurrency's correction from its record high of nearly $65,000 landed BTC/USD right at the same 50-week SMA support around $30,000. At the same time, its move lower enabled a death cross setup.Bitcoin's price action in the past week also hinted at a bullish divergence scenario, as shown in the chart below.TradingShot, a market analytics platform, noted that a bullish divergence formation, coupled with a rebound from the 50-week SMA support, could again send Bitcoin prices to the 61.8% Fib level of the current top-to-bottom Fibonacci retracement graph.""The support of the 1W MA50 is key as it is being achieved despite Bitcoin being on Lower Lows (LL) while the 1D RSI is on Higher Lows (HL),"" he explained.In a chart provided by TradingShot, the 61.8% Fib level appeared near $47,500. Meanwhile, the other chart above showed the profit target near $50,000.The statements appeared as Bitcoin closed its second quarter at a 41% loss, logging its worst declines since the 43% sell-off in the fourth quarter of 2018. The cryptocurrency's recent drop took cues from a flurry of negative fundamentals, including China's crackdown on the crypto industry, global regulators increasing their scrutiny, and as well as Elon Musk's anti-Bitcoin tweets.Meanwhile, demand for Bitcoin also declined after the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone. The U.S. central bank announced that it might hike its benchmark interest rates by the end of 2023 to curb inflationary pressures, coinciding with a BTC/USD rate plunge on June 16 and afterward.Despite strong headwinds, Bitcoin managed to float above $30,000, a psychological support level and is currently back above $35,000. However, the equally strong resistance level at $40,000 is keeping the cryptocurrency's short-term bearish bias intact.""One expects that the longer we go without a $40,000-handle, eventually support is going to crumble and give way to a sharp move towards $20,000,"" Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at ThinkMarkets, told the Wall Street Journal, noting that it leaves Bitcoin at crossroads in the third quarter.TradingShot added:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

297,"About 2,000 years ago during its Han dynasty, China made peace with some of the nomadic people of Central Asia who continuously ransacked Silk Road traders for an easy payday. It did so in order to fully establish the Silk Road trade route, which stretched from China to Europe, and to secure a great source of wealth from trading in luxury goods.Now, as trade increasingly has shifted to the digital realm during the global COVID-19 pandemic, cyberattackers are taking advantage of organizations’ lax cybersecurity measures. They are using ransomware to lock these organizations’ data with encryption until a ransom payment in cryptocurrency is made. Back in 2019, 98% of ransomware payments were made in Bitcoin (BTC).Related: Not like before: Digital currencies debut amid COVID-19Anne Neuberger, United States deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, explained:The administration of President Joe Biden is moving to treat cyberattacks — which are estimated to cost $1 trillion a year and often take the form of ransomware — as a national security threat. Intelligence agencies have concluded that they pose an elevated threat to the country, with gasoline, food supplies and hospital systems at risk.Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice seized 63.7 BTC (worth approximately $2.3 million at the time) representing the proceeds of a ransom payment made by Colonial Pipeline to the group known as “DarkSide.” It did so via a coordinated effort with the DoJ’s Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force, which collaborates with domestic and foreign government agencies in addition to private-sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.Related: Cybercrime task force monitoring the global digital financial systemLisa Monaco, the DoJ's deputy attorney general, noted: “Following the money remains one of the most basic, yet powerful tools we have.” She continued:Paul Abbate, deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, added:One question is whether ransomware payments can be considered an “ordinary and necessary” cost of doing business and be deducted from taxable income as a theft loss under Sections 162(a) and 165(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides the authority to deduct any losses that were not covered by insurance or some other means. There are several judicial and administrative definitions of theft, and the Internal Revenue Service’s definition seems broad enough to encompass a cyberattack and allow for ransomware payments made in cryptocurrency to be deducted as a business expense for federal tax purposes.However, under Section 162(c), if the ransom payment in cryptocurrency constitutes an illegal bribe, illegal kickback, blackmail payment or other illegal payment — such as one made to a group classified as a terror organization under any U.S. law — it would not be tax-deductible. Thus, a taxpayer should distinguish illicit payments from ransomware cryptocurrency payments by highlighting the theft of property. Questions of illegality may arise when paying a ransomware demand in cryptocurrency to a cybercriminal with a known connection to a sanctioned or boycotted foreign government.Related: Sanctions compliance for transactions in fiat and cryptocurrencies are the same: Expert takeHere is an example, provided by Elliptic co-founder and chief scientist Tom Robinson: “Elliptic was first to identify the Bitcoin wallet used by the DarkSide ransomware group to receive a 75 Bitcoin ransom payment from Colonial Pipeline. [...] DarkSide [which is believed to be based in Eastern Europe] is an example of ‘Ransomware as a Service’ (RaaS). In this operating model, the malware is created by the ransomware developer, while the ransomware affiliate is responsible for infecting the target computer system and negotiating the ransom payment with the victim organisation. This new business model has revolutionised ransomware, opening it up to those who do not have the technical capability to create malware, but are willing and able to infiltrate a target organisation.”Ransomware attackers may even offer a victim company a discount if it transmits the infection to other companies. These ransom payments in BTC are then laundered on dark web markets, according to a report issued by Flashpoint and Chainalysis.Any ransom payment made in cryptocurrency is taxed as property rather than currency. Therefore, taxpayers are expected to keep detailed records of these ransom payment cryptocurrency transactions, report any gains and report the fair market value of any mined cryptocurrency on their tax returns as well.Additionally, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, also regulates cryptocurrency-related transactions pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by stating that “An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter.”Thus, under the BSA, a cryptocurrency transmitter is required to complete a risk assessment, develop a written program to avoid money laundering, designate an individual compliance officer and complete other action items.Related: The United States updates its crypto AML/CFT lawsIt should be noted that other profiting and culpable participants in a Bitcoin ransom payment scheme might find themselves facing criminal and tax fraud/evasion penalties. For example, John McAfee, founder of the antivirus company bearing his name, had recently been charged with various tax crimes in the U.S. relating to nominee-held cryptocurrency transactions and was facing many years in prison if convicted. This may have been a factor in his decision to commit suicide in a Spanish jail after the court ruled he could be extradited to the United States.Related: John McAfee’s suicide reports raise disbelief, spark conspiracy theoriesIn remarks to the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, FBI Director Christopher Wray advised ransomware victims to not pay a ransom to retrieve hijacked data or regain network access. He said that “In general, we would discourage paying the ransom because it encourages more of these attacks, and frankly, there is no guarantee whatsoever that you are going to get your data back,” adding: “We have to make it harder and more painful for hackers and criminals to do what they are doing.” And he continued:The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
298,"In the whirl of excitement and debate over where cryptocurrencies are going and whether they are legitimate, sustainable and prudent investments, there is an overshadowed conversation of interest to those in marketing: Are Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Cardano’s ADA, Litecoin (LTC), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), etc., crypto brands?And, if so, how are those brands created, and what role do they play in each coin’s adoption? Or, for that matter, how does branding collectively contribute (or detract) from the legitimacy of a cryptocurrency as it seeks increased mainstream acceptance/use?Related: Decentralization vs. centralization: Where does the future lie? Experts answerTo begin to answer that, consider David Ogilvy’s — a British advertising tycoon, known as the “Father of Advertising” — definition of a brand: “The intangible sum of a product’s attributes.” These often include an identity, voice, empathy, value proposition and consistency in delivering on promises made. Ultimately, attributes like these, among others, circle the nucleus of a product/service like atomic particles to create trust, preference and loyalty (or lack thereof).One could argue that fiat currencies are brands insomuch that their issuing countries work to create value and confidence in them. However, with little to no competition in their native countries, assigned commodity identities (dollar, pound, euro, yuan, etc.), and no real attempt by the governments (the “brand” owner) or other entities to change how the currency is perceived or even used, it’s difficult to consider them as such.Looking to other examples in finance, stocks are a way to own the brands that issue them. Mutual funds also assume the halo of the brands that manage them — though there are instances where funds such as Fidelity’s Magellan Fund and Vanguard’s Wellesley Income Fund have become prominent brands. You can also think of funds as baskets of brands.Moreover, commodities such as gold, silver and copper are, well, commodities. And this brings us to cryptocurrencies.Consider the following:For all these truths, a few intriguing questions remain: First, if decentralization is core to the concept of cryptocurrency, who is controlling and nurturing each of the brands? And if trust is a central tenet of brand health, how does a trustless technology fit in?Related: Bitcoin's evolving narratives make it antifragileUnlike user-generated content (UGC) — which is solicited by marketing organizations to provide a voice for the customer, authentic perspectives and active engagement — a user-generated brand’s (UGB’s) content is largely unsolicited and uncontrolled. Like sourdough, get it started and it’ll grow on its own. (That seemed like an apropos analogy given sourdough’s global COVID-19 pandemic popularity.)Lacking a central owner or the equivalent of a brand manager or chief marketing officer, these brands are created and nurtured by project founders, user communities, investors, miners and more. They’re at Meetups, on forums, chat rooms and subreddits. In fact, brand health can be correlated to just how robust the conversation is on channels like these.Brands are molded by a vocal and growing community of influencers who include crypto heroes like Andre Cronje and Vitalik Buterin, tech pioneers like Marc Andressen and Elon Musk, finance stars like Cathie Wood and Jamie Dimon, and popular voices like Shark Tank’s Mr. Wonderful (Kevin O'Leary) and The Mooch (Anthony Scaramucci). This all suggests that the trajectory of these UGBs and how they will be consumed by individual investors, institutional investors and the media is largely unpredictable. Or is it?Related: Experts answer: How does Elon Musk affect crypto space?Many, if not most, crypto projects have a foundation or decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Think Bitcoin.org, the Ethereum Foundation, the Cardano Foundation and other open-source resources of which there are too many others to mention. These foundations release white papers as de facto advertisements and raise capital through crowdfunding using initial coin offerings as their currency. And, yes, advertising agencies are hired and other resources are implemented to mold their brands — though those who actually approve the creative can vary widely, perhaps the community of users itself or those holding governance tokens.Ultimately, from a traditional brand management standpoint, only so much control exists while these projects seed and shepherd their UGBs. Armed with that active, engaged, highly passionate community, they can:Returning to the second question, the most important task of any foundation, along with its community of followers within a UGB, may be to create trust in the trustless. To put it another way, to distinguish and differentiate the currency based on how its technology/project is vetted, secure, truly independent, and — perhaps most importantly — how it can quickly answer the question: What is it for?This last point, of course, isn’t unique to cryptocurrencies and their UGBs. The institutions that must communicate their choices to customers, the companies selling exchange-traded products, the exchanges themselves, wallet applications and so forth in this category that is growing blisteringly fast while still being a colossal mystery to all but a few, will ultimately distinguish themselves in the mainstream by doing what other great brands have done: Making it clear, making it simple and delivering on a promise.In other words, to dispel the misconception among the vast majority of non-crypto nerds that all cryptocurrencies are intended to replicate fiat for the purchase of common-day goods and services, and instead, articulate their very specific purposes.Where cryptocurrencies will go from here will be fascinating to watch.

299,"Whether a potential sell-off of shares tied to a multi-billion dollar Bitcoin (BTC) investment fund could crash the cryptocurrency's spot prices has turned into a hotly debated topic among the analysts in the space.The argument concerns Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world's largest digital assets manager that allows institutional investors to gain indirect exposure in the Bitcoin market through its product, GBTC. Investors purchase GBTC shares directly via Grayscale in daily private placements by paying in either Bitcoin or the U.S. dollar.Nevertheless, investors can sell their GBTC shares only after a six-month lockup period in secondary markets to other parties. Therefore, they anticipate liquidating at a premium when the market price at the time of sale crosses above the native asset value (NAV).On the other hand, liquidating GBTC shares when the market price has dipped below the NAV brings losses. So if investors decide to dump their GBTC holdings, they would have to do so for a financial casualty. That is because the share has been trading at a discount, i.e., under its NAV, since February 24, 2021.Some analysts, including strategists at JPMorgan, believe that accredited investors will sell at least a portion of their GBTC holdings after the July unlocking period, thus weighing further on the ongoing Bitcoin market downtrend.“Despite this week’s correction, we are reluctant to abandon our negative outlook for Bitcoin and crypto markets more generally. So despite some improvement, our signals remain overall bearish,"" said Nikolas Panigirtzoglou, the lead strategist at JPMorgan, in a note to clients.Nevertheless, other analysts believe that the event will flush sellers from the market in July, opening up both volatility and bullish potential to break new all-time highs.It is the GBTC shares that were scooped up by investors at around 40% premium in December 2020, explained Panigirtzoglou. The month saw Grayscale Bitcoin Trust attractive inflows of $2 billion, followed by $1.7 billion in January.That means about 140,000 Bitcoin worth of shares will get unlocked by the end of July. About 139,000 Bitcoin have already been released between mid-April to mid-June, a period that also coincided with spot BTC/USD's crash from around $65,000 to as low as $28,800.Lyn Alden, the founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, noted the correlation between the spot Bitcoin price crash and its Grayscale's GBTC unlocking periods, noting that the same could happen as more shares get unlocked in July.Alden hinted that the correlation pointed to a deceleration of Grayscale's ""neutral arbitrage trade.""In arbitrage trade, institutional investors (like hedge funds) borrow Bitcoin to purchase GBTC shares. Then, after the lock-up expires, these investors sell GBTC shares to secondary markets to retail investors, typically for a premium. Then, they return the borrowed Bitcoin to their lenders and pocket the difference.""Part of the run-up in the second half of 2020 was due to the Grayscale neutral arbitrage trade, sucking in a ton of bitcoin,"" Alden tweeted late Monday, adding:But, according to David Lifchitz of ExoAlpha, arbitrage strategy might have contributed to but did not cause the Bitcoin price plunge.The chief investment officer noted that the real GBTC arbitrage trade strategy is for investors with deep pockets. That is because they would require to hold the short Bitcoin position during the GBTC lockup period — the overtime costs would risk offsetting the price differential that was arbitrage away.""And for the simple buyers of GBTC shares at a discount vs. BTC who didn't sell short BTC against, their profit depends on the price at which they bought GBTC: if they bought between $40K and $60K, they are in the red today... and may not want to sell just yet and lock-in their loss,"" he told Cointelegraph.Michael Sonnenshein, the chief executive of Grayscale, told Barron's that investors buy the GBTC shares with a medium- to long-term outlook. So they might not want to dump their holdings immediately upon its unlocking.Sonnenshein added:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

300,"Crypto and blockchain enthusiasts take pride in belonging to a community that is working on the future of financial systems. Yet, the community is innately fragmented thanks to multiple blockchains working independently of each other. The dream of mass adoption of blockchain and decentralized finance faces a major hurdle: a lack of interoperability.Meanwhile, decentralized applications (DApps) — the fruits of decentralization — are being held up. DApp developers face difficulties while transacting between different blockchain networks, and the reason behind this is they are stuck in the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite having the best infrastructure, Ethereum is losing its foothold.Related: Professional traders need a global crypto sea, not hundreds of lakesAs per a DApp market report, around 59% of all DApps run on the Ethereum blockchain. The growth of decentralized finance on Ethereum notwithstanding, many developers and users are unhappy with the network.Growing transaction charges are an outright bane for developers and users alike. Likewise, the Ethereum network is also prone to clogging. Even six years after launch, Ethereum’s transaction speed languishes around 15 transactions per second (TPS). The combination of the above factors derails the efforts of developers by pummelling the feasibility of their projects.Related: Where does the future of DeFi belong: Ethereum or Bitcoin? Experts answerAlso, the highly-anticipated Ethereum 2.0 upgrade fails to address the scalability issues. Eth2’s complete implementation may be more than a year away. When you consider associated efforts like proof-of-stake migration and security upgrades, measures to tackle the scalability issue seem to be nowhere near the priority list.Part of the vision for Eth2 is “to make applications faster and cheaper to use.” With reality furthering itself away from that vision, however, the crypto-finance community is looking for alternatives.These alternatives are built on collaboration rather than competition. The potential driver of decentralized finance growth is enhanced interoperability.Touted as a solution for applying decentralized finance outside of the Ethereum blockchain, interoperability furthers the idea of decentralization. By facilitating seamless communication between different blockchain networks, interoperability is where the future lies.With interoperability, the traditional mentality of “I use blockchain B as it is better than blockchain A” undergoes a paradigmatic shift. We are moving toward a culture where blockchains A and B collaborate and are used in unison for a specific purpose.For better context, consider this: Without interoperability, the vast majority of DeFi protocols would lack the largest blockchain network and cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC). However, with the help of blockchain bridges, it is now possible to transfer one’s BTC holdings to the Ethereum network in the form of wrapped tokens such as Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), which has tokenized around 1% of Bitcoin’s supply on Ethereum. These ERC-20-compatible wrapped tokens offer faster Bitcoin transactions and enable users to employ Bitcoin on DeFi protocols such as Aave to lend and borrow assets — or perform other DeFi activities.It’s also because of blockchain interoperability that users have the freedom to transact ERC-20 tokens on the Binance Smart Chain, dodging Ethereum’s spiking gas fees and executing transactions almost instantly. The arrival of interoperable solutions shall act as a window for multiple DeFi products and applications.Many developers, particularly those in high-volume sectors such as gaming, are now looking to layer two solutions to solve their problems. However, many of these solutions have been slow to deliver while developers waver over options like Plasma state channels technology. Rollups are the hot new workaround, bundling transactions for higher throughput.Related: Layer-two scaling solutions solve enterprises’ public blockchain challengesHowever, the fact is that many Ethereum layer two protocols leave DApps constrained to the Ethereum ecosystem. Without the chance to interoperate, developers and users can’t tap into any value emerging from other platforms.Moving on, how can we attain seamless interoperability while bypassing the challenges faced by existing layer two infrastructure?As the name implies, blockchain bridges are built to span blockchains and facilitate communication. This technology solves the issue of interoperating between two different protocols. Using trustless bridges, users can leverage the benefits of both blockchains.Generally, these bridges are governed by the “burn-and-mint” approach. According to this, tokens do not leave their respective blockchains during the transaction. The token is burned or locked in its blockchain, while its equivalent is minted or created on another blockchain. This method ensures a constant token supply and reduces volatility.There are two types of blockchain bridges: federated and trustless. The former is a private and more centralized project that requires certain criteria to be met before the bridge can be used. On the flip side, trustless bridges operate in a decentralized environment: Similar to Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) miners, trustless bridge validators receive incentives to maintain the bridges. Here, trustless bridges work on mathematical truths and are devoid of any human errors or corruption.Alongside innate transparency, there are multiple advantages associated with trustless bridges. They enable the interoperability of tokens between different networks. Ethereum can use this ability to offload its transactions to another blockchain. Also, trustless bridges help to reduce congestion in blockchains with high volumes of transactions, providing users — and especially DApp developers — with a seamless transaction experience.The employment of trustless bridges is an effective way for blockchains to grow in unison. It also acts as a great incentive for developers to design DeFi applications that advance the prospect of an open financial system. Trustless bridges usher in a new era of interoperability that will ultimately unlock new value for the benefit of all market participants.Through trustless bridges, the potential emerges for DeFi platforms and centralized banks to collaborate. A peer-to-peer-based banking system that leverages the convenience of traditional banking setups is a hope gifted by trustless bridges.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

301,"Bitcoin (BTC) has recorded its biggest mining difficulty drop of nearly 28% on July 3, but one model suggests that the BTC price will not bottom until October.In a series of tweets on July 2, investment manager Timothy Peterson flagged the relationship between Bitcoin price and hash rate as arguable evidence that the dip is not over.Bitcoin mining difficulty dropped by an estimated 27.94% on Saturday at block height 689,472, the biggest in its history.As Cointelegraph previously explained, the drop is in response to the ongoing miner migration out of China and the subsequent loss of hash rate.For miners still at work, the decrease will be something of a profit boost — difficulty automatically accounts for changes in hash rate, making it more attractive to mine when it drops.Miners in flux are not expected to return to their craft completely for several months. In that time, difficulty will likely increase again as hash rate goes up — more competition and more power competing for the same set reward.It is a classic mantra among Bitcoiners that “price follows hash rate” — but if that is true, one model charting the phenomenon is painting a sobering picture of future price behavior.Peterson noted that the relationship between price and hash rate is “useful” when it comes to marking macro price tops.An accompanying chart shows spikes in 2013 and 2017, corresponding to tops which held for an entire four-year halving cycle.2021 looks similar, but since the May capitulation, the relationship has been trending towards 1 — the point at which the Bitcoin price should have fully “corrected.”“Based on the current trend in P(h), this bubble would finish collapsing by 31 October,” Peterson summarized.In other words, the return of miners is likely to prevent further price dip episodes of the magnitude seen recently, but bulls may still need to wait longer than desirable to see higher levels return.An important caveat came from Peterson, who cautioned that there are “many things wrong” with such a simple model, and that he himself does not use it.The model is not the only source catering to a return to form for Bitcoin in the latter half of the year.Related: Bitcoin sees 4.5% dip amid warning BTC price indicator bottom may still comeAs Cointelegraph reported, analysts have likened 2021 to both previous top years, these seeing a first local price peak, a correction then a surge to the ultimate top later on.After BTC/USD posted its third consecutive monthly red candle, meanwhile, the stock-to-flow price model echoed the start of 2019, just after the pit of Bitcoin’s last major bear market.The next six months, creator PlanB says, will be critical for its utility."
302,"Choppy markets have defined the crypto space since Bitcoin (BTC) sold off on April 19, and indecisive markets like these can test the patience and fortitude of even the most dedicated traders and analysts, especially when the incessant calls for a bottom are met with lower lows.While the periods of low trading volume and whipsaw price movements may be the perfect conditions for whale-sized traders to play in, the average investor doesn’t stand a chance, especially with multimillion-dollar funds now beginning to get in on the action.Data shows that instead of day trading and attempting to time the market bottom, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is the best method for retail investors looking to build long-term profits in both traditional and crypto markets.In 2020, Coin Metrics pointed out that investors who dollar-cost averaged into BTC starting from the December 2017 peak were still in profit three years later.Coin Metrics tweeted:While the graph is a little dated now, one can see that over the long term, consistent investments spread over time have led to an overall increase in portfolio value.Currently, with BTC down more than 47% from its all-time high of $64,863 and the cryptocurrency market continuing to send mixed signals, it may be an opportune moment to deploy the DCA strategy.Let’s take a look at the results of dollar-cost averaging into multiple cryptocurrencies from 2017–2018 through the end of June 2021.The starting point for each analysis will be the day of the token’s 2017–2018 bull market all-time high value, and weekly investments of $10 will be applied from that point forward.The peak for Bitcoin during the cycle came on Dec. 15, 2017, when BTC traded for $19,497, according to data from CoinMarketCap.Using the DCA estimation tool provided by CostAVG.com, one can see that if $10 was invested in BTC on a daily basis from Dec. 15, 2017 until June 30, 2021, the total investment of $1,850 would have seen a 306% increase in value to be worth $7,519.If one were to ask the opinions of most fund managers or traders who earn a living in the traditional investing world, a 306% increase in portfolio value over a four-year period is a spectacular rate of return.The price of Ether (ETH) exploded from late 2020 through early 2021 as the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFT) exponentially increased the use of the Ethereum smart contract blockchain and boosted demand for ETH.Increased demand helped ignite a rally that sent Ether’s price to $4,363 on May 12, 2021, but its price has since fallen nearly 50% to trade below $2,200 at the time of writing.During the 2017 bull market, the price of ETH reached an all-time high of $1,396 on Jan. 12, 2018. Investors who used the DCA strategy, investing $10 per month starting at the peak, would have spent a total of $1,810 and generated a portfolio value of $15,507 at Ether’s current price. This represents an increase of 757%.Related: Ethereum 2.0 approaches 6 million staked ETH milestoneThe percentage gain for Ether is more than double what it would be for Bitcoin, giving some credence to those who have argued that Ether has been a better investment over the past couple of years.To show the benefit of applying the DCA strategy to smaller-cap altcoins, let’s do a quick analysis of Theta, which has been one of the breakout stars of 2021.THETA began a parabolic price climb in December 2020, with its price increasing from around $0.80 to $2.40 by Jan. 1, 2021. It then skyrocketed to an all-time high at $14.28 on April 15.According to Blockchaincenter.net, which offers data for dollar-cost averaging a variety of tokens at a set investment of $10 per day, if an investor had begun investing in THETA on Jan. 1, 2018, the cumulative investment of $12,480 would now be worth more than $638,000 — a 5,000% increase.While it’s obvious that not all altcoins performed as well as THETA during that time period, it’s a good example of how steady investing into a smaller-cap project can reward patient investors.The benefit of dollar-cost averaging is that it removes emotion from the investment process and allows the investor to focus on other things, whereas day traders spend hours behind screens and often take on more losses than gains.This also removes the need to search for market tops and bottoms and allows investors to gain exposure to a variety of assets in a measured, consistent manner.No technique is perfect, and not every crypto project will make substantial gains or even survive until the next bull market cycle, but dollar-cost averaging is one approach that has provided consistent results for amateur and expert investors alikeQuotes in this newsletter taken from previously published sources have been lightly edited.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

303,"According to publicly available data from the University of Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance and the International Energy Agency, or IEA, bitcoin (BTC) carbon emission intensity may have already peaked.The environmental impact of bitcoin's electricity usage is a favorite talking point of its critics and journalists on the crypto beat. But taking in the available data, Hass McCook, a retired chartered professional engineer, reckons bitcoin's carbon emissions ""have already peaked a few months ago.""McCook unpacked the data and defended that conclusion in a guest post on Bitcoin Magazine's website Friday:BitAll's bitcoin mining infrastructure was created over the last 12 years, giving miners the ""second mover advantage"" to avail their operations of the latest, most sustainable green tech for electricity to mine bitcoin.Data from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index suggests that global bitcoin mining has a ""grid intensity"" (carbon emissions per unit of electricity consumed) that's cleaner then the average of the entire global power grid. The world average is 463 grams of CO2 emitted per kilowatt hour. Bitcoin miners average 418 grams.Meanwhile, world grid intensity peaked sometime last year, if the energy economy stays on track with projections for 2021 and subsequent years, according to data from the IEA. By design, computers running Bitcoin Core to validate and place new blocks on the bitcoin blockchain are required to use some electricity to correctly guess the input for a SHA-256 encrypted hash.SHA-256 (short for Secure Hashing Algorithm) is a one-way hash function published by the U.S. National Security Agency in 2001, and an integral part of the bitcoin design architecture. Computers test the guess by entering it into the algorithm and seeing if it matches the hash on the previous block. The first node to guess the hash correctly gets to place the next block of transactions and award the bitcoin miner in newly-created bitcoin.This proof-of-work, or PoW, mechanism qualifies nodes to participate on the network by forcing miners to venture electricity costs, and risk losing their operating costs for no profit if their computer attempts to cheat the network's rules.Some Bitcoin critics, and even proponents, say that its energy consumption poses environmental risks, and may contribute to human-caused global warming. Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously rattled bitcoin's price this year by announcing the electric carmaker would accept BTC for Teslas, then backpedaling.Musk said Tesla would begin accepting bitcoin again when 50% or more of miners' energy usage is reasonably confirmed to be from ""clean energy"" sources.McCook says most of the bitcoin emissions claims are overblown:A Bitcoin Mining Council survey report out this week estimates a 56% sustainable power mix for Q2 2021 in bitcoin mining operations globally based on respondents' answers."
304,"Bitcoin (BTC) price remains relatively unchanged on the 24-hour chart, down 0.56% and trading around $33,200 at the time of writing.The overall cryptocurrency market traded flat on July 2 with the approach of the Fourth of July holiday weekend in the United States. The lackluster trading volume coincided with a slight decline in the total cryptocurrency market capitalization by $5 billion to its current value of $1.378 trillion. Despite the struggles faced by the market as a whole, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro has identified bullish developments in Axie Infinity (AXS) and Waves (WAVES) thanks to recent developments related to nonfungible tokens.Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as Axies. Since hitting a swing low of $2.85 on June 22 as the price of BTC crashed below $29,000, the price of AXS has surged 125% to an intraday high at $6.40 on July 2 as the demand for Axie’s continues to rise.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for AXS on June 29, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for AXS first registered in the green beginning June 26 as the price of AXS began to slowly creep higher and finally reached a high of 83 on June 29 as its price began to climb another 45% over the next three days.At the time of writing, the VORTECS™ Score for AXS had climbed to a new high of 86, indicating that there could still be more upside ahead for the price of Axie Infinity based on the previous price action of the token.Waves has also been identified by Cointelegraph Markets Pro as a strong performer after its VORTECS™ Score turned bullish in late June.As seen on the chart above, market conditions for WAVES were favorable during the last month of June with its VORTECS™ Score reaching a high of 83 on June 27, just four hours before its price began to increase by 35% over the next three days from $13.31 to a high of $17.75.The VORTECS™ Score for WAVES has once again climbed to 83 on July 2, hinting that the bullish case for WAVES may still be intact.The overall weakness in the altcoin market stems from Bitcoin’s price struggling below $33,400 as many traders appear to have gotten an early start to their holiday weekend.Related: 44% of investors expect Bitcoin to drop below $30K in 2021: CNBC surveyData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of BTC has traded in a tight range between $32,650 and $34,000 on July 2 as traders wait for a major news event or on-chain development to initiate the significant price move for the top cryptocurrency.The current overall mood in the market is one of uncertainty, as displayed in the following tweet from Filbfilb, an independent market analyst and co-founder of the Decentrader trading suite, who remains “undecided what happens next” and is “watching for blood.”Long weekend in the US.

305,"The Wyckoff Accumulation technical chart pattern has become the latest trending topic when anticipating where the price of Bitcoin (BTC) may go next. Some analysts have said that BTC’s recent dip below $29,000 signaled the “Spring” phase, which will soon be followed by a climb higher. While the bulls make the case for the continuation of the bull market trend seen earlier in 2021, others are warning that the price of Bitcoin is not out of the woods yet, particularly in the short term.According to Filbfilb, an independent market analyst and co-founder of the Decentrader trading suite, bullish traders may have gotten ahead of themselves and could be mistaken about the pace of recovery.Wyckoff appears to be the flavour of the month at the moment.

Over the years ive noticed that most people all do one main thing in common which is to assume that the accumulation will happen quicker than it actually does and ignore the size of the drawdown. pic.twitter.com/bqWeFBVtV3Notably, the Wyckoff pattern has been redrawn multiple times over the past couple of weeks as chartists attempt to have the price action match their view of what happens next, potentially ignoring other warning signs and avoiding data that doesn’t fit their perspective, according to Filbfilb.He said,One of the biggest barriers to a BTC recovery higher identified by many is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust unlock schedule, which shows a large amount of GBTC yet to be unlocked in mid-July.1/
On July 12, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) will unlock 2 thousand BTC (~ $ 69M), and on July 17, another 16 thousand BTC (~ $ 550M) and investors will be able to sell their shares of the bitcoin trust, purchased in January (32k-42k $ for BTC).As seen in the chart below, the largest GBTC unlock of the year will occur in July and has the potential to put downward pressure on price, particularly since some previous big unlock dates coincide with major BTC price volatility in recent months.Related: 3 things traders are saying about Bitcoin and the state of the bull marketBecause of these potential headwinds, Filbfilb says that what happens in the near term is “too early to call as we haven't done enough time at the bottom,” further indicating that it might take until early Q4 before the cycle plays out.Filbfilb said,The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

306,"The stablecoin market has been growing exponentially, and last week, Eric Rosengren — president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston — appeared to raise a cautionary flag. “There are many reasons to think that stablecoins — at least, many of the stablecoins — are not actually particularly stable,” he said in remarks before the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, voicing concerns that “a future [financial] crisis could easily be triggered as these become a more important sector of the financial market, unless we start regulating them.”Moreover, in an accompanying slide presentation, the bank CEO referenced Tether (USDT), the dominant stablecoin issuer, noting that its basket of reserve assets looks very much like a “very risky prime fund” — the sort that got into trouble in the last two recessions.Was Rosengren right to call out Tether by name for its reserve assets, which include commercial paper, corporate bonds, secured loans and precious metals? Could the parabolic growth of stablecoins truly destabilize short-term credit markets, and would the stablecoin sector be better served by more rigorous reserving and auditing?Also, given that Tether by far remains the dominant player in the global stablecoin market, what would happen if it falters — could it bring down the larger crypto market along with it? As the chart below used in Rosengren’s presentation shows, stablecoin market capitalization relative to prime money market mutual funds under management now exceeds 20%.Francine McKenna, adjunct professor at American University’s Kogod School of Business, understands Rosengren’s concern. She told Cointelegraph that these new stablecoin funds are, in a sense, “interlopers” in the traditional short-term credit markets and that the Boston Fed president and his peers could be realizing that “suddenly we don’t have our fingers on all the levers.”Stablecoins are affecting short-term credit prices now, but these instruments could just as quickly exit the market. In mid-June, a “run” on the Iron Finance protocol, for instance, caused the price of its IRON stablecoin to move off peg and crushed its native token, TITAN, by almost 100%, impacting investor Mark Cuban among others.Rohan Grey, assistant professor at Willamette University College of Law, told Cointelegraph that if Tether collapses, it could have dire effects on the cryptoverse:Circle and a few other stablecoins have begun to take market share from Tether, “So it’s definitely possible that some other stablecoin will step into the breach, but even without Tether, the rest of the crypto industry remains built on a foundation of stablecoins,” he added.Controversy has dogged USDT through much of its short history, and in February, Tether and its Bitfinex affiliate agreed to pay the state of New York $18.5 million for misrepresenting the degree to which USDT was backed by fiat collateral.“Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie,” said New York State Attorney General Letitia James when announcing the settlement, which also requires Tether and Bitfinex to submit mandatory quarterly reports on USDT reserves — the first of which was summarized in Rosengren’s slide deck.Not all were reassured by the March USDT report, however. The fact that commercial paper accounted for half (49.6%) of assets was a particular eyebrow-raiser. “The fact that Tether is holding so much corporate paper and corporate bonds is a huge issue,” Grey told Cointelegraph, adding: “No one knows what it is, and it’s completely at odds with their claim for years that they were only invested in cash or cash-like assets.”A “cash equivalent” has to be something especially “liquid with no market uncertainty,” McKenna explained to Cointelegraph: “Commercial paper is not generic. There are all sorts of commercial paper.” She said that it’s not like the old days when people said that General Electric’s commercial paper was “as good as gold.” Today, “You have to see who the issuer is.”“USDT has been a big question mark since its inception,” Sidharth Sogani, founder and CEO of research firm Crebaco, told Cointelegraph. If Tether is investing assets in something other than U.S. dollars, then what happens if those assets — e.g., precious metals or corporate bonds — fall in price? “Will USDT lose its value?” Also, how are earnings being distributed? Tether’s users presumably own the bonds and commodities backing the stablecoin, “So the interest earned is the users’ right,” said Sogani.Not everyone has a problem with Tether pegging its token to a basket that includes commercial paper, however. “To my mind there is nothing inherently wrong with a stablecoin — USDT or not — holding or being backed by commercial paper, as opposed to being 100% backed by a specific fiat currency,” Sean Stein Smith, assistant professor in the Department of Economics and Business at Lehman College, told Cointelegraph.That said, Stein Smith acknowledged potential “complications” that could arise — a “run” on the stablecoin could destabilize a specific tranche of the commercial paper market, for example. Or conversely, if the commercial paper market “seized up,” it could disrupt redemptions of that particular stablecoin.Would a regular audit of Tether’s reserves by a Big Four accounting firm improve its standing regarding the “backing” question? “Regular auditing would absolutely help,” said Stein Smith, “both in raising the confidence in the backing of USDT, and creating crypto-specific standards that could be adopted by other stablecoin issuers going forward.”But others aren’t so sure. USD Coin (USDC), the second leading stablecoin, has Grant Thornton LLP confirm that it has sufficient U.S. dollar reserves every month, for instance. This is often cited as a better approach, but even this has serious limitations, in McKenna’s view. All that is really happening, McKenna explained, is a monthly verification of the issuer’s bank balance. Two minutes after the auditor examines the bank statement, the stablecoin issuer could simply transfer funds elsewhere.What’s the answer then? According to Mckenna, it’s escrow accounts — i.e., “segregated client funds like broker/dealers are required to have.” In any event, “There are lots of ways to tie up money so it can’t be touched.”Elsewhere, another sticking point for people is the fact that according to Tether itself, only 2.9% of USDT’s asset backing is in cash, which has led some to say that Tether is acting like a bank — but without being subject to a bank’s heavy regulation.“It is pretty clear looking at the makeup of the reserves — a tiny proportion of the reserves are cash on account at banks — that Tether is operating like a bank but with none of the normal disclosure,” Martin Walker, director of banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management, told the Financial Times.Meanwhile, all the publicity about reserves probably isn’t helping the stablecoin attract new users. According to CoinMarketCap, USDT’s market capitalization has barely budged over the past month. With U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, market capitalization is a good proxy for total supply because each coin is very close to $1.00. Meanwhile, USD Coin and Binance USD (BUSD), Tether’s closest competitors, have both increased their market cap substantially during this period — 10% and 12%, respectively, since the start of June.Cointelegraph invited Tether/Bitfinex to comment on the idea that it seems to be losing ground to its competitors but did not receive a response.There is no sign of any imminent USDT collapse, but given Tether’s continuing market dominance, such an event is often a topic of conversation — as a matter of speculation. Sogani told Cointelegraph:Stein Smith, by contrast, doesn’t agree that stablecoins generally, or USDT specifically, represent much of a threat to financial stability or the crypto ecosystem. “If stablecoins truly did pose a global systemic risk, why are so many central banks experimenting and deploying central bank digital currencies — which are at a basic level government issued-stablecoins,” he said, adding:Elsewhere, stablecoin regulation could be coming, at least if certain initiatives prove successful. “It is important that when a fiat-currency-pegged stablecoin is issued that it is regulated,” said Sogani, “or else it is like creating value out of thin air to keep buying more crypto, especially Bitcoin. Since stablecoins are centralized in most cases, strict regulations must be in place because of lack of transparency.”The stablecoin market is fragmented globally, too, as different organizations have their own stablecoins, and many stablecoins are available on multiple chains. USDT, for example, is available as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, a TRC-20 token on Tron and a BEP-20 token on Binance Smart Chain and can also be used via the Omni Layer on Bitcoin (BTC), which makes auditing more difficult.“Stablecoin is essentially unregulated free banking that issues deposits. However, free banking never worked in the past, even in cases where the government required backing,” Yale University finance professor Gary Gorton recently presented along with his opinion that “There needs to be credible backing for Stablecoin as they are now runnable without any entity overseeing them.”“The sector could profit from more regulation,” Willamette University’s Grey told Cointelegraph. Grey helped draft the Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement (STABLE) Act, which was introduced in the United States House of Representatives in December 2020. The STABLE Act would, among other things, require U.S. stablecoin issuers to obtain bank charters and prior approval from the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the appropriate banking agency in their jurisdiction.All in all, stablecoins have exploded recently, and as a result, they are attracting more attention from financial regulators. Tether sits at the top of the stablecoin pyramid, but questions remain about whether all fiat-based stablecoins are really pegged one to one, said McKenna. “If I need cash to honor redemptions or pay taxes am I going to get dollar for dollar?”After all, when money market funds “broke the buck” during the 2008 financial crisis — i.e., when their net asset value fell below $1 — it was because those funds had invested in derivatives, commercial paper and other suddenly illiquid assets. McKenna concluded: “Yes, there are enormous reasons for the Fed and its presidents to be concerned.”"
307,"A recent run-down in the Bitcoin (BTC) market faces the prospects of exhaustion before confirming a full-fledged bearish breakdown, so reflects a classic momentum-based oscillator.Dubbed as Relative Strength Index, or RSI, the indicator measures the speed as well as change of directional price movements. It operates within a set range of numbers—between 0 and 100. The close is RSI to 0, the weaker is the price momentum. Conversely, an RSI reading near 100 reflects a period of strong momentum.The range also helps determine an asset's buying and selling opportunity. In detail, an RSI reading below 30 means the asset is oversold, thus an attractive buy. Meanwhile, RSI above 70 shows an overbought asset, meaning its holders would eventually sell it to secure profits.The RSI also enables traders to spot buying/selling opportunities based on divergences between the price and the momentum. For example, when price makes a new low but RSI makes a higher low, then it is considered a buying signal—a bullish divergence. Conversely, a Bearish RSI Divergence appears when price makes a new high but RSI makes a lower high.So it appears, Bitcoin is confirming a bullish divergence.Independent market analyst CryptoBirb spotted the price-momentum deviation on Bitcoin's one-day chart. In there, the pseudonymous entity noted BTC/USD forming a sequence of lower lows around the same period its RSI climbed while forming higher lows.The statement appeared as the BTC/USD exchange rate corrected lower after forming a local top at $36,675 on June 29. However, as of the Friday London session, the pair was trading below $33,000. The RSI fell in tandem with the latest downside move and was near 42 at press time, a neutral-to-bullish area.Downside sentiment in the Bitcoin market persisted due to a flurry of pessimistic events. That included a global crypto crackdown that started with a ban in China in May and spread to the UK, India, South Africa, and the United States.For instance, the Financial Conduct Authority banned the world's leading crypto exchange Binance from undertaking regulated activities in the U.K. Additionally, in India, Enforcement Directorate issued a show-cause notice to Binance's subsidiary exchange, WazirX, for facilitating money laundering.  More headwinds appeared from hints of hawkishness from the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank surprised Bitcoin investors with its sudden intention to control inflationary pressures with eventual interest rate hikes in 2023. BTC/USD dropped by more than 28% after the Fed's big reveal but later recovered after finding credible support near $30,000.Nonetheless, bulls kept failing at sustaining Bitcoin price uptrends above the $40,000-level. As a result, the cryptocurrency remains stuck inside the $30K-$40K range, showing no clear directional bias in the short term.Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at CEX.IO, also noted that accredited investors have started maintaining distance from Bitcoin over its concerning environmental impacts. He added that mainstream interest in the cryptocurrency will return once miners switch to alternative sustainable energy options.""When the environmental concerns are no longer a worry, many institutional investors are likely to trust the digital currency again, and as such buy more,"" Anissimov told Cointelegraph, adding:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

Answering the survey for ""Where will Bitcoin be by the end of the year?"" Squawk Box reported: Out of the remaining 56%, 25% predicted the price to shoot up and settle at $45,000 while the other 25% supported BTC to square on the $55,000 mark. A small minority of 6% said that Bitcoin could return bank back to $60,000, near its $65,000 all-time high from back in April 2021.Although experts argue that a cryptocurrency's worth can only be equated to its use case, Bitcoin has been standing its ground as a true store of value against all odds and speculations. Given the financial predicament for panic sellers and the changing opinion about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, the adoption rate continues to see a steady increase across the globe serving unique use cases.As this particular poll represents only a small fraction of the crypto demographic, and in no way represents the entirety of the investors' sentiments, readers are advised not to make investment decisions based on bearish or bullish market discussions.

A notice on the website reads: “This software is presently not available for download in the UK, and download links will not work if you are located within the United Kingdom.”Indeed, attempting to proceed with downloading the Bitcoin (BTC) software from the site using a U.K. IP returns a “404 error.”Detailing the reason for blocking access to the software download for U.K. site visitors, Bitcoin.org’s pseudonymous owner Cøbra responded to a tweet stating:The whitepaper is in the blockchain and can be retrieved through the software. I'm not allowed to distribute the whitepaper on https://t.co/1dtx7wYjP2, or ""in any other way"". We have to follow the law.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, a U.K. court ruled in favor of self-proclaimed Bitcoin creator Craig Wright in a copyright infringement case against Cøbra and Bitcoin.org for hosting the Bitcoin white paper.However, the default judgment was only because Cøbra elected not to mount a defense. As part of the ruling, Cøbra was also instructed to cover Wright’s legal fees to the tune of 35,000 British pounds (about $48,600).Related: Craig Wright wins default judgment, Bitcoin.org must remove Bitcoin white paperThe judgment is the latest salvo in Wright’s assault on people who dispute his claim of being Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. In January, Wright demanded that Bitcoin.org, Bitcoin.com, and Bitcoincore.org remove copies of the Bitcoin white paper from their respective websites.Wright continues to maintain that Bitcoin white paper is his intellectual property. Meanwhile, he continues to be a proponent of Bitcoin SV (BSV), a factional chain that split off from Bitcoin Cash (BCH) which is itself another forked chain from Bitcoin.The Bitcoin software download is still available on Bitcoincore.org, even for visitors with U.K. IP addresses as of the time of writing.Indeed, geofencing the download link on Bitcoin.org is not likely to impact people interested in running Bitcoin Core in the country, given the multitude of workarounds like virtual private networks and other websites that host the software."
311,"The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a global financial institution owned by some of the world’s biggest central banks, is trying to dispel the theory that cryptocurrency ownership is linked to distrust in traditional finance.On Thursday, the BIS published a paper on the socioeconomic drivers of cryptocurrency investments in the United States. Employing representative data from the U.S. Survey of Consumer Payment Choice, BIS argued distrust in fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar has nothing to do with investor motivation to hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), stating:The authority stressed that cryptocurrencies are not sought as an alternative to fiat currencies or regulated finance but instead are a “niche digital speculation object.” BIS noted that from a policy perspective, the overall takeaway of the analysis is that investors’ objectives are the “same as those for other asset classes, so should be the regulation.”Related: El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption an ‘interesting experiment,’ says BIS execThe BIS paper also outlines major correlations between crypto investment choices and the level of education and income, suggesting that cryptocurrency owners are “generally more educated than the average.” Ether (ETH) and XRP investors showed the highest education level in the BIS’ analysis, while those owning Litecoin (LTC) were the least educated, with Bitcoin owners ranking in the middle.The new report brings significant relevance that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin pose no threat to traditional finance tools, as crypto demand is not driven by distrust in cash. A number of global authorities and institutions previously expressed concerns about Bitcoin’s ability to capitalize on global distrust in traditional finance. In late December, Morgan Stanley Investment’s Ruchir Sharma argued that the U.S. dollar’s reign will likely end due to global distrust in traditional finance, while Bitcoin would capitalize on the lack of confidence."
312,"Crypto hedge fund Nickel Digital Asset Management cycled into a cash position following the crypto market collapse of May.According to Bloomberg, the $200 million crypto hedge fund led by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs alumni redeployed its capital in anticipation of another explosive price run for cryptocurrencies.Prior to piling into a cash position, Nickel Digital focused on cryptocurrency arbitrage opportunities resulting from cryptocurrency price differences across the spots and derivatives markets.Indeed, crypto arbitrage trading reportedly offered double-digit annualized gains for institutional investors with sufficient capital to make sizable returns on these momentary price gaps. These trades are market neutral rather than directional since the focus on price discrepancies and not price action.Commenting on the fund’s investment thesis, Nickel Digital CEO Anatoly Crachilov told Bloomberg: “We don’t take directional bets, so whether Bitcoin goes up 300% or down 70%, we will seek to capture arbitrage opportunities from market dislocations,” adding:Nickel Digital has reportedly earned 29% in gains at 3.5% volatility, far lower than the 78% market average volatility for crypto assets. However, Bitcoin’s (BTC) blow-off top back in April and the ensuing altcoin capitulation in May has reportedly upended these arbitrage opportunities for hedge funds like Nickel Digital.Bitcoin’s 50% crash from its $64,000 all-time high triggered a cascade of liquidations in the futures market especially for over-leveraged longs to the tune of about $9 billion. Altcoins also crashed more than 70% and price action has remained in a sideways accumulation state with frequent 10 to 15% dips.Related: ‘Bitcoin will go all the way to $160,000 this year,’ says Celsius CEOFor Crachilov, it is all about playing the waiting game, for now: “June will be remembered as a cash-rich, wait-and-see month.” The Nickel Digital CEO also stated that the current market downturn is not out of the ordinary for investors long in the crypto business.The crypto hedge fund chief stated that institutional investors are starting to move away from seeing crypto investments as a reputational risk. Indeed, banks in the United States and Europe are beginning to offer direct exposure to Bitcoin for both retail and big-money players.Back in June, Alex Mashinsky, CEO of crypto lending platform Celsius, told Cointelegraph that he sees Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $160,000 before the end of the year."

314,"Bitcoin (BTC) retained a key support area on Friday as bidders stepped in to avert another test of $30,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD bottomed out at local lows of $32,700 overnight.A subsequent rebound took the pair almost $1,000 higher before settling at around $33,300 at the time of writing.As Cointelegraph reported on Thursday, this is above the $33,000 zone, which at least one trading source identified as highly significant for bulls to keep intact.Going into the weekend, the mood is thus not as gloomy as it once was, this being tempered by expectations that a “leg down” could — or even should — still occur.Popular trader Crypto Ed eyed a potential trip to a local bottom in Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), which would, in turn, produce an oversold price dip followed by a correction.“When following RSI pattern/trend and that wave pattern, BTC could do 1 more leg down,” he considered.Since coming off $64,500 all-time highs, Bitcoin has dipped to a maximum of $28,600, with lower lows and a challenge of the 2017 peak of $20,000 so far absent.Nonetheless, price action remains rangebound, with analyst Rekt Capital seeing a solid downward trend, which nonetheless contains a clear level to reclaim for a breakout.“BTC is still maintaining this structure and the blue diagonal will still be the trend line to watch for a breakout when the time comes,” he said in comments on an accompanying chart.Altcoins, meanwhile, slipped from prior strength, with losses broadly beating Bitcoin’s slight downturn to hit 5% or more.Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market capitalization, traded at $2,060 on the day, down 3% — a story matched by various other major cryptocurrencies.Ethereum Classic (ETC) came off its publicity boost highs from earlier in the week, while publicity from Elon Musk likewise failed to deliver sustained gains to Dogecoin (DOGE), which was down 4% at the time of writing.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

More than 6 million new customers bought crypto on the platform within the first two months of 2021.Mallers is taking aim directly at Coinbase with the move, labeling its excessive trading fees as “asinine”. He pointed out that Coinbase made $1.8 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, with $771 million in profit, 94% of which coming from fees as high as 3%.He was highly critical of the exchange’s free giveaways which award users with a couple of dollars worth of altcoins for watching videos.Related: Coinbase could see fee compression in long term, CEO expectsThere was also a dig at PayPal which he stated has also recently hiked fees across the board, and now charge sellers 3.49% + $0.49 to process crypto transactions.Mallers added that the aim is to drive prices in the market as close to nothing as possible, which would be in keeping with Bitcoin’s ethos.As reported by Cointelegraph, Strike has entered into a partnership with the El Salvador government to assist with its Bitcoin adoption rollout."
316,"The number of addresses active on the Bitcoin network has crashed roughly 60% in the past six weeks from 1.3 million to roughly 500,000.The collapse in activity has seen Ethereum overtake Bitcoin by the number of active addresses, with the Ethereum network hosting roughly 200,000 more active wallets than Bitcoin on Friday.It is the third time in a month that Ethereum has overtaken Bitcoin by the metric, also happening on June 5, 2021, and June 6, 2021. The previous time Ethereum was in the lead was at the beginning of 2017.Twitter analyst Mr. Whale — known for his bearish takes — also noted that Bitcoin’s active addresses have fallen to their lowest level since April 2020 based on a weekly moving average.Bitcoin’s active addresses on the blockchain network just plunged to its lowest level since April 2020.

This data is bearish. It shows demand for Bitcoin is drying up very quickly. pic.twitter.com/vdmwagbvtmSeveral factors may be contributing to the aggressive drop in active Bitcoin addresses, including the more-than-50% sell-off that followed Bitcoin’s (BTC) all-time highs in May and subsequent sideways market action and the massive crash in network hash rate amid China’s latest crackdown on local Bitcoin mining operations.Ethereum’s active addresses increased by more than 9% over the past week to tag 700,000 despite the price of Ether (ETH) falling more than 10%. However, active Ethereum addresses are still down 22% from their early April peak of 900,000.Active addresses is the latest metric by which Ethereum has overtaken Bitcoin, with Blockchain Center’s Flippening Index estimating Ethereum’s transaction fee revenue leads by more than 300%, while total transaction count is ahead by nearly 500%.However, Bitcoin has also reclaimed a lead in both trading and transaction volumes after recently falling behind Ethereum.According to a June 23 report from on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, the total number of unique addresses interacting with DeFi protocols has continued to climb since May, suggesting decentralized finance (DeFi) activity was rising despite the broader crypto meta-trend.Related: Almost twice as much ETH locked in DeFi as on exchanges: GlassnodeThe data shows a nearly 40% increase in the number of wallets that have interacted with DeFi protocols since the start of May, pushing the total user count up to more than 2.9 million. As such, persistent demand for DeFi from new users may explain Ethereum’s recent strength in network activity relative to Bitcoin’s."
317,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape, and enterprise blockchain integrations.Flags and celebrations were the order of the day as the Chinese Communist Party celebrated its 100th birthday on July 1. Many had pinpointed this event as part of the motivation behind the recent crypto crackdowns, as prominent holidays prompt leaders to clean up their jurisdictions so that societal issues don’t distract from the celebrations. A strong and uniform financial system is certainly one of the areas that tends to be the focus prior to these large events.The good news for the FUD-sensitive members of the community is that after these events, regulation has a history of loosening, allowing the real economy to restore a healthier balance with strict rule of law. Many inside the industry are hopeful they will be given more room to innovate, particularly  exchanges and miners who have been hit the hardest. Rumors were spread about the possibility of a regulated mining community, allowing the government to tax, regulate and even participate in mining activities. That rumor might be based more in optimism than reality, but would certainly make sense to those wondering why China’s leadership would allow a growing industry to shift to Western powers in the middle of a rising tech war.In the final days before July 1, the pressure seemed to intensify on those in the cryptocurrency space. Global Times, an English-language division of the People’s Daily, ran an opinion piece entitled Bitcoin can only ever exist underground. The article, written by a research fellow at Renmin University and Beijing Foreign Studies University, predicted that the illegal speculative activities would gradually be removed from China and the price would drop sharply at that time. Caixin, a business and finance magazine, published a scathing editorial on June 28 recommending using the same force that the nation used against epidemics in order to fight cryptocurrencies. This seems extreme, considering how seriously the country took its COVID-19 response. Nevertheless, leading local blockchain media groups were the latest casualties when micro-blogging platform Weibo suspended the popular accounts of BlockBeats and Chainnews.Top exchange Huobi updated its user agreement on June 28 to exclude Chinese users from accessing futures trading. This follows a flurry of international restrictions focusing on derivatives, as regulators in Ontario in Canada, as well as the UK, cracked down on Binance. Futures trading is popular in China, and any prolonged ban from Huobi will likely result in Chinese users flooding elsewhere. Overseas exchanges like Binance and decentralized protocols stand to benefit the most.Small-scale hydroelectric plants pose a possible alternative for crypto miners looking to operate on the sly. Secondhand marketplace app Xianyu, a product of Alibaba, reportedly had a surge in hydroelectric plants in the wake of many large-scale miners, which were previously customers, being forced to shutter their facilities.On June 30, the Beijing subway began accepting e-CNY payments, according to the article on Cointelegraph. The pilot program is only available to customers of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, one of the largest banks by assets. The Beijing Subway has a daily ridership of over 10 million people, most of whom use QR codes or NFC chips in their mobile phones to enter and exit the stations. Suzhou, which neighbors Shanghai, announced a similar program on June 29."
318,"Blockware announced Thursday that they have raised $25M in a second oversubscribed fundraising round.They plan to use the funds to expand their bitcoin mining operations in Kentucky, and will also install 8,000 more bitcoin mining rigs on its Paducah campus, where it recently purchased 5 acres of land.The company has already purchased the necessary rigs, and 6,000 more that it has slotted for resale operations to other miners. Funds from previous seed rounds paid for the purchase of all 14,000 rigs.The fast-growing mining company plans to more-than-treble its entire global hashrate in a year. Blockware’s current capacity runs at some 0.3 exahashes per second (EH/s). That’s one quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) hashes every second.With profits from bitcoin mining and other mining-related business operations, as well as investor funding, Blockware is hoping to reach a global hash capacity in excess of 1 exahash by mid-2022.The company noted in the press release that like its previous private placement, the round was oversubscribed. That means investors lined up to offer more than the mining company was seeking at this time, an indication of investor confidence in Blockware’s operations.In previous rounds, the bitcoin mining firm raised a total of $7 million in funds. That brings its total accumulation of privately equity placements to $32 million.Kentucky enjoys some of the lowest industrial energy costs for electricity in the United States. That’s good for a business in an industry with a bottom line that’s notoriously sensitive to the rise and fall of energy prices.Last month, Stoltzner told Kentucky Today:Blockware claimed that one key to their success has been its strong efforts to make inroads with local authorities as it builds operations in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.Earlier this week, we reported that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency miners are currently fleeing China after Beijeng’s crackdown on mining operations there.

319,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been ranging from $30,400 to 36,400 for the last 12 days, and it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for investors’ lack of appetite. Some analysts have pointed to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) unlocking in mid-July finally giving institutional investors a chance to offload their funds, but this is not likely to be the main reason.Meanwhile, industry leaders have suggested that the “crypto regulatory crackdown” taking shape in the United States is severely impacting investors’ sentiment, and this view is especially problematic considering China has recently banned all crypto mining activity in the country.Lastly, renowned Bitcoin critics, including Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, have claimed that the cryptocurrency “failed miserably” as a currency.Damodaran specifically cites Bitcoin’s limited use in microtransactions, even though El Salvador is pushing forward with a plan to democratize the Lightning Network solution.After bears had a victory in the recent quarterly $3-billion options expiry on Friday, the winds may have shifted the tide favorably to bulls this time around. While the $34,000 level presented a $310-million advantage for the neutral-to-bearish put options last week, this upcoming Friday, July 2, holds an entirely different setup.The initial picture paints a neutral structure, with the neutral-to-positive call options open interest dominating by 8% as per the call-to-put ratio. Out of the $445 million in open interest, $230 million is represented by the neutral-to-bullish call options, which gives a slight advantage to bulls. However, looking at more granular data provides a different angle.Related: Crypto traders say negative funding rates are buy signals, but are they?Only 18% of the protective put options have been placed at $33,000 or higher strikes. Therefore, if Bitcoin is trading above that level at 8:00 am UTC on Friday, only $38 million worth of those neutral-to-bearish instruments will last.On the other hand, bulls will likely try to defend the $34,000 level, resulting in $45 million in call (buy) options open interest.Truth to be told, both sides have incentives to break this reasonable equilibrium at $34,000. For example, above $35,000, bulls’ advantage increased from $7 million to $57 million.Conversely, bears have the upper hand if Bitcoin trades below $33,000. In this case, protective put options open interest is $31 million higher than the neutral-to-bullish call options.To sum up, it is impossible to predict whichever side will come out stronger on Friday’s expiry. However, this is the first time in over four weeks that bulls have a decent fighting chance.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

320,"Bitcoin (BTC) needs to stay above $29,000 to preserve the bullish case in the short term, famous trader Peter Brandt has warned.In a tweet on July 1, Brandt, well known for his shrewd BTC price calls in recent years, warned that the onus was on bulls to show Bitcoin's strength.BTC/USD lost around 5% on Thursday, erasing more and more of its previous gains even as many on-chain indicators flipped bullish.For Brandt, lower timeframes showed little optimism, and a shake-up was now necessary to disrupt the negative tone.""The 5-week rectangle continues to form. The daily chart is decidedly negative,"" he commented alongside an annotated price chart.That level would still be higher than that to which Bitcoin dipped last week, with the current local bottom at $28,600 on Bitstamp.Violation of this floor opens up ground towards the previous multi-year high of $20,000, various sources have warned. Bitcoiners are nonetheless at odds over what could happen in terms of bearish near-term price performance.On Wednesday, analyst John Bollinger, creator of the Bollinger Bands, eyed $31,000 as the lowest of three ""logical"" levels for BTC/USD. Some responses argued that such levels would not be revisited based on recent behavior.Bollinger revealed he was also watching $35-36,000 and $41,000.""So far they have been important milestones,"" he said.Bitcoin nonetheless conformed to predictions over its likely daily bounce level on Thursday.As Cointelegraph reported, a crucial zone to hold for traders is between $32,300 and $33,000, with BTC/USD holding at the upper end of that area.Related: Coincidence?

321,"The United States’ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network will continue to closely follow the cryptocurrency industry as one of its top priorities for combating crimes like money laundering.FinCEN officially announced Thursday that “virtual currency considerations,” or operations involving cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), will be among its top national priorities for countering terrorism financing and ensuring proper Anti-Money Laundering policies.“The establishment of these priorities is intended to assist all covered institutions in their efforts to meet their obligations” under related laws and regulations, the regulator said. FinCEN elaborated that it will soon issue regulations to specify how financial institutions should incorporate these priorities into their AML programs.“FinCEN recognizes that not every priority will be relevant to every covered institution, but each covered institution should, upon the effective date of future regulations to be promulgated in connection with these priorities, review and incorporate, as appropriate, each priority based on the institution’s broader risk-based AML program,” the authority noted.Referring to cryptocurrencies as “convertible virtual currencies,” or CVCs, FinCEN pointed out that such assets became the “currency of preference in a wide variety of online illicit activity.” The authority then detailed a wide range of CVC uses by criminal actors, arguing that it is a “preferred form of payment” for buying illicit goods like ransomware tools or even advancing activities like “nuclear weapons ambitions.”“For example, North Korea-linked cyber actors likely have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of CVCs since 2019 through cyber operations against CVC service providers, laundered stolen CVC value through other CVC service providers and CVC wallets, and used the proceeds to help fund weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs,” FinCEN wrote.Related: Former Chainalysis brass is now FinCEN’s acting directorThe news comes in line with recent remarks by Brian Nelson, the Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. At a Senate hearing in late June, Nelson announced that he would push for implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, including some “new regulations around cryptocurrency.”FinCEN’s increasing attention to the crypto industry comes months after President Joe Biden froze FinCEN-backed rule to monitor crypto on self-hosted wallets as one of the first presidential actions in office. The authority introduced the proposal in late 2020 under former U.S. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, planning to require all banks and money businesses to submit reports and verify the identity of customers involved in crypto wallet transactions."
322,"Bitcoin (BTC) closed its third red monthly candle in a row this week as a popular analyst likened BTC price action to January 2019.In a tweet on Thursday, PlanB said that BTC/USD is now the furthest away from his stock-to-flow model’s estimates in over two years.After May’s huge capitulation event, Bitcoin price action has failed to regain lost ground, staying around 50% below recent all-time highs.As a result, price models are getting a serious test — even as on-chain indicators are beginning to flash bullish again.In the case of stock-to-flow, which calls for an average price of at least $100,000 this halving cycle, the situation is getting precarious.Famous for its accuracy, the model has accounted for every twist and turn in BTC price action since its inception. Now, however, the spot price is nearing the limits of what it can accommodate.“Even for me it is always a bit uneasy when bitcoin price is at the lower bound of the stock-to-flow model,” PlanB admitted last week.Nonetheless, given the changes that can occur in Bitcoin in a matter of months, there is little cause for concern about stock-to-flow becoming invalidated.“June closing price $35,037 .. as far below S2F model as in Jan 2019,” PlanB added on Thursday, implying that it is still “business as usual” for the model’s relationship with price.Last time Bitcoin was so far from stock-to-flow, which predicts a price of $77,760 for Thursday, BTC/USD had just emerged from the pit of the 2018 bear market, during which it dropped to just $3,100.As Cointelegraph reported, price playing “catch-up” with on-chain indicators has become something of a defining narrative in recent weeks.Related: Coincidence?

The new fees will take effect starting in January 2022.According to local news agency Kursiv, the new law introduces an additional fee of 1 Kazakhstan tenge ($0.00233) per kilowatt-hour used by cryptocurrency miners.The additional tax levy is part of a series of legislative amendments to the national tax code concerning crypto miners. The Kazakh parliament passed the bill in mid-June.Albert Rau, Chairman of the committee for economic reform and regional development,  said that the main purpose of the new legislation is to regulate the crypto mining industry and “bring it out of the shadows.” Rau is a former First Vice-Minister of investment and development of Kazakhstan and is reportedly the author of the new legislative initiative.Kazakhstan has recently emerged as a major destination for cryptocurrency mining operations.

On Thursday, popular trader Michaël van de Poppe reiterated the need for that zone to hold.The pair had reversed after reaching nearly $36,700, erasing most of the gains it had sealed in a run-up that began on the weekend.“Would be nice if Bitcoin creates a higher low here & flips $33K for support to sustain the momentum,” he said in his latest Twitter update.Exchange orderbook data broadly supported the thesis, with buyer interest lined up at an area around $32,000, while $37,000 seller resistance remained intact on Binance.At the time of writing, BTC/USD was falling steadily toward the zone of interest, circling $33,300.Current spot price weakness thus continues the “tale of two Bitcoins” scenario that has emerged over the past week or so.Specifically, on-chain indicators are broadly bullish and insisting that a recovery is already underway, while BTC price action has failed to comply.Related: Biggest-ever mining difficulty drop: 5 things to watch in Bitcoin this weekSummarizing comments from statistician Willy Woo on Tuesday, analyst William Clemente III pointed to a reaccumulation of BTC as being the main takeaway from the past month’s volatile price period.Woo had uploaded Bitcoin liquid supply ratio data showing strong hands adding to their positions while new investors panic sold.“Imo this chart is the easiest way to visualize what’s taken place over the last month under the hood,” Clemente III commented."
326,"As major miners are leaving China one after another following the country’s crackdown on Bitcoin (BTC), Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has echoed other experts in seeing the migration out of China as a positive development.Novogratz explained on Bloomberg that despite China’s attempt to undermine Bitcoin — like banning mining, banning leverage, and even banning Bitcoin in some places — the original cryptocurrency is still alive and kicking. “Bitcoin still exists and survives in lots of ways,” he said, adding that miners’ migration out of China could be “a big net positive for the ecosystem.”The last couple of weeks, where the crypto market experienced high volatility with sudden price crashes across the board, was an amazingly successful test for the crypto ecosystem as a whole, according to Novogratz.“We had a crash,” Novogratz summarized, referring to the 65% drop in Bitcoin price from the all-time highs, adding:Speaking on the public perception of the crypto ecosystem, Novogratz singled out Bitcoin as “it carved out its lane” as digital gold. Gold has existed for 3,000 years, he reminded, adding, “I expect Bitcoin to be the digital version of gold for the next 3,000 years.”Related: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey keeps saying ‘no’ to EthereumNovogratz said that he thinks “Ethereum most likely becomes the second biggest, or maybe even the biggest cryptocurrency one day.” It’s going to be used at the base level of trust, he summarized, “The Web 3.0 where things get built on top of it.” He noted that it has strong competitors like Terra and Solana and it’s not an assured win for Ethereum.Novogratz also listed more recent additions to the crypto ecosystem, like decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens before concluding:"
327,"Bitcoin (BTC) technical analyst Willy Woo believes that this is not a bear market because on-chain indicators are signaling a recovery and that the asset is still being bought by long-term hodlers.The popular analyst’s comments came in an interview on the What Bitcoin Did podcast on Monday. Woo stated that he does not believe that Bitcoin is in a typical bear market due to signs of accumulation showing on-chain.Referring to the 1980’s hit song “Never Gonna Give You Up” by British pop artist Rick Astley, Woo stated:He added that we are currently in a speculative phase, and those coins that were sold earlier this year are slowly being absorbed by long-term holders.Podcast host Peter McCormack revealed that he hasn’t sold any crypto assets yet and is still confident because there is “still too much going on and good stuff happening.”Related: 3 things traders are saying about Bitcoin and the state of the bull marketAnalyzing the current Bitcoin price chart, Woo stated that it is a cycle unlike any we’ve ever seen, as the underlying structure is completely different. He stated:Analytics provider Santiment appears to have noticed similar data, and it noted that the supply of Bitcoin sitting on exchanges has steadily fallen back down and is getting locked away for safekeeping by hodlers.Following #Bitcoin's mid-May dip, the supply of $BTC sitting on exchanges has steadily fallen back down and locked away for safe keeping by hodlers. This is a good sign for #bulls, as funds moving away from exchanges lowers the risk of major sell-offs. https://t.co/ABkcih9ea1 pic.twitter.com/NqU3ljRyIHCommenting on current regulatory pressure, which has escalated in China, the United States and the United Kingdom, Woo stated:At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading within its six-week range bound channel, down 3.7% over the past 24 hours at $34,653, according to CoinGecko. As reported by Cointelegraph, traders have been eying three key areas for the monthly candle closure."
328,"Derivatives data shows that Ether (ETH) traders are feeling less bullish when compared to Bitcoin (BTC). Even though the altcoin captured a nearly 200% gain in the first half of 2021 versus Bitcoin's modest 22% price increase, traders seem to be more affected by Ether's recent underperformance.Institutional flow also backs the decreased optimism seen in Ether derivatives, as ETH investment vehicles suffered record outflows this past week while Bitcoin flows began to stabilize. According to data from CoinShares, Ether funds experienced a record outflow of $50 million this past week.Take notice of how Ether is underperforming Bitcoin by 16% in June. The London hard fork is scheduled for July, and its core proposal — dubbed as EIP-1559 — will cap Ethereum's gas fees. Therefore, the price action could be related to unsatisfied miners as the network migrates out of Proof-of-Work (PoW).For this reason, Ether investors have reason to fear because uncertainties abound. Perhaps miners supporting a competing smart-contract chain or some other unexpected turn of events could further negatively impact Ether price.Whatever the rationale for the current price action, derivatives indicators are now signaling less confidence when compared to Bitcoin.In healthy markets, the quarterly futures should trade at a premium to regular spot exchanges. In addition to the exchange risk, the seller is 'locking up' funds by deferring settlement. A 4% to 8% premium in the December contracts should be enough to compensate for those effects.A similar effect occurs in almost every derivatives market, although cryptocurrencies tend to present higher risks and have higher premiums. However, when futures are trading below this range, it signals that there is short-term bearish sentiment.The above chart shows the Bitcoin December futures premium recovering to 3.5% while Ethereum contracts failed to follow. While both assets displayed a neutral-to-bearish indicator, there's evidence that the altcoin investors are less optimistic about a short-term recovery.Related: Key Bitcoin price indicator flashes its 'fifth buy signal in BTC history.'Another thesis that could negatively impact Ether's premium is the impact of a potential negative 30% performance from Bitcoin. Filbfilb, an independent market analyst and the co-founder of the Decentrader trading suite, said that a 30% crash in the Bitcoin could prompt altcoins to drop twice as hard.Clem Chambers, the chief executive of the financial analytics website ADVFN, also predicted another potential leg down, which would repeat the late-2018 crypto winter period. Chambers claims Bitcoin could capitulate and fall back towards $20,000.While the overall market sentiment is neutral-to-bearish, it seems sensible to predict a more daunting scenario for Ether, including uncertainties from the transition to Proof-of-Stake (POS).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

329,"The U.S. House committee on financial services held a hearing Wednesday for legislators and a panel of witnesses to discuss cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.The subcommittee on oversight and investigations invited expert witnesses to testify before congress on the risks and opportunities of blockchain technology.Rep. Brad Sherman (D-MN), a ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, was not keen on the idea of investing in cryptocurrency to save for retirement:He also quipped that the California lottery would make a better “bet” than blockchain: But Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), another senior member of the committee, was more concerned that regulatory interference was preventing Americans from benefitting fully from crypto entrepreneurship:Hard-learned lessons from the 2008 financial crisis seemed to loom large over the statements made by witnesses and members of congress. That year’s subprime mortgage crisis in real estate lending quickly spilled over into adjacent financial sectors.When it did, a wild array of innovative–– and unwieldy–– new financial instruments wiped out huge swaths of investors and plunged the entire U.S. economy into a recession.The structural instabilities and excessive euphoria that characterized this period’s runaway growth of new securities derivatives were exacerbated by massive amounts of leverage.Recent years have seen the rapid proliferation of new ventures and technologies to support and expand the capability, use, exchange, and “hodling” of cryptocurrencies— and the blockchains that maintain them. Some lawmakers and regulators fear it’s like the runup to 2008 all over again.Efforts to regulate blockchain technology, and mitigate the risks involved when trading them as securities, are a confusing patchwork as lawmakers scramble to understand the new technologies and the industry that’s building them.Not all federal legislators are wary of crypto. Some even endorse them. In a recent CNBC interview, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) said she hopes to see bitcoin as a normal part of a diversified retirement portfolio to hedge against inflation. And earlier this month, the National Republican Congressional Committee began accepting crypto donations for campaign funds."
330,"Bitcoin's (BTC) whipsaw volatility has been on full display throughout June, leaving traders confused and in search of the latest technical indicator or major news announcement that might provide some hint at which way the price will move. As the month of June comes toward an end, traders are now focused BTC's on the monthly close to determine if the forward outlook is tilted toward bulls or bears.At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is still 47% away from its all-time high at $64,873 and analysts have a mixed view on whether or not the bullish momentum will return in the short term. Here are three perspectives analysts have in mind as the market prepares to head into the month of July.A survey of crypto Twitter shows that many chart watchers have identified $34,500 as a crucial price level that needs to be defended to establish the bull case for Bitcoin moving forward.So far, this current period in the 2021 cycle is very similar to the 2013 mid-cycle correction

A #BTC Monthly Candle Close above ~$34500 would mean that BTC will continue to respect historical Mid-Cycle tendencies$BTC #Crypto #BitcoinAccording to Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous trader on Twitter, a close near this level would put the market on a similar trajectory to the BItcoin price pattern seen during the 2013 bull market which included a mid-cycle correction before price broke out to a new all-time high later in the year.From this bullish perspective, the price of Bitcoin should soon continue the uptrend that began in late 2020 and will theoretically lead to a new all-time high later in 2021 or early 2022 which is projected to surpass $100,000 according to the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model.Despite the widespread acceptance and faith in the S2F model, Bitcoin's recent price action led even Plan B, the creator of the popular model, to feel “uneasy” about BTC's most recent dip to the lower bound of the model.Even for me it is always a bit uneasy when bitcoin price is at the lower bound of the stock-to-flow model. Will it hold (like Mar 2019 when I published S2F, or Mar 2020 Covid, or Sep 2020 with BTC stuck at $10K) and is this another buying opportunity? Or will S2F be invalidated? pic.twitter.com/iIjTC2Ncy3While bull market advocates look for any sign to validate a move higher, the price action on June 30 caught the eye of another pseudonymous Twitter analyst called John Wick. According to the analyst, there is a bearish topping pattern that can be se in the most recent BTC chart.#BTC (4h update)

Just as we were getting off to a good start, a topping signal printed & confirmed. Had confluence from Bearish RSI cross + Bearish Thrust

Lets see if we can hold $34k support. If not we are still range bound. Getting above upper $36k & $41k are the resistances pic.twitter.com/RZ4IAGoi16According to Wick, Bitcoin now needs to hold support at $34,000 or the market could be in for another extended period of sideways, range-bound trading rather than a fledgling move higher.Bearish sentiments were also highlighted in the following tweet from the Twitter personality Nunya Bizniz, who points out that BTC would need to close above $37,400 to avoid three consecutive down months, which has historically indicated more downside in the future.BTC monthly:

Month closes tomorrow.

A close above $37.4K would avoid 3 consecutive down months.

Three down months have marked more down side.

What happens?

331,"Soros Fund Management, the private investment firm of billionaire George Soros, is reportedly trading Bitcoin (BTC) as part of a broader exploration of digital assets, according to financial news website TheStreet. People familiar with the matter told author Michael Bodley that Dawn Fitzpatrick, the chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management, gave the green light to trade Bitcoin and possibly other cryptocurrencies in the last few weeks. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the sources said Fitzpatrick and her team have been exploring cryptocurrencies for some time and that the latest venture is “more than just kicking the tires” on digital assets.A spokesperson for Soros Fund Management was contacted by TheStreet but declined to comment.Fitzpatrick is also reportedly in conversations about acquiring a private stake in leading blockchain-based enterprises, though the names of these companies weren’t provided. As Cointelegraph reported, Soros Fund Management was one of several firms behind the $200 million funding of New York Digital Investment Group, better known as NYDIG. MassMutual, Morgan Stanley and Stone Ridge Holdings Group also participated.At the time, NYDIG co-founder and CEO Robert Gutmann said the investment round was evidence that institutional adoption of Bitcoin was on the rise.TheStreet's report has already circulated on Twitter, with several prominent industry voices joining the discussion. George Soros has given his team the green light to trade bitcoin.

This could be a positive or a negative depending on how they trade it :)https://t.co/fq4LsE77gxRelated: Financial advisers lead the institutional push toward crypto adoptionIt’s not entirely clear how Soros Fund Management intends to trade Bitcoin, if at all. An investment stake in the digital asset shouldn’t necessarily be viewed as bullish given that Soros earned his reputation for shorting the British pound in 1992 and effectively ‘breaking the Bank of England.’Nevertheless, Fitzpatrick has spoken favorably about Bitcoin in recent months. In March, she said cryptocurrencies like BTC are at an “inflection point” that could catalyze greater adoption in the future.""We've been making some investment into that infrastructure and we think that is at an inflection point,"" she told Bloomberg in March."
332,"Bitcoin price staged a mild resurgence at the start of this week but data from Glassnode suggests that its new BTC investors who came late to the party and are dumping their positions in a panic.This transfer of crypto assets from speculators or momentum chasers to long-term investors is a positive sign. This lays the groundwork for the start of the next bull run but it may not happen in a hurry.At the moment, institutions are unlikely to buy aggressively and propel the price of Bitcoin higher because there is still a chance that they can accumulate at lower levels. Therefore, the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.According to Forbes, New York Digital Investment Group’s (NYDIG) partnership with enterprise payment company NCR may empower 650 banks and credit unions in the U.S. to offer Bitcoin trading services to more than 24 million customers. This move is likely to attract several new investors to crypto, which is a long-term positive.Will Bitcoin and altcoins witness selling pressure and break below their recent lows or will buyers propel the price above the local highs? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin broke above the 20-day exponential moving average ($35,196) on June 29, which is a positive sign. This showed that traders were not booking profits at the 20-day EMA but were trying to push the price above it.However, the bears have not allowed the price to sustain above the 20-day EMA. This suggests that sellers are defending the zone between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day simple moving average ($37,752).The bears will now try to pull the price down to $31,000 but the flattening 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) above 45 suggest the selling pressure could be reducing.A shallow pullback from the current level will enhance the prospects for a break above the 50-day SMA, clearing the path for a rally to $42,451.67.This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the $31,000 support. That could result in a decline to the critical support at $28,000.Ether (ETH) broke above the 20-day EMA ($2,170) on June 29, indicating strength. However, the bears did not waste time and have pulled the price back below the 20-day EMA today. This suggests that sellers are not willing to let go of their advantage easily.If the bulls do not allow the price to dip below $2,000, the ETH/USDT pair will once again try to rise above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the pair could rise to the downtrend line. The bears will try to stall the rally at this level.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $2,000, the pair may again drop to the $1,728.74 support. Repeated retests of a support level tend to weaken it. If the price slips below $1,728.74, the selling may intensify and the pair may drop to $1,536.92.Binance Coin (BNB) is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA ($315). The bears will now try to pull the price below the immediate support at $264.26. If they succeed, the altcoin could drop to the critical support at $211.70.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside.Alternatively, if the price again rebounds off $264.26, the buyers will try to drive the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could move up to the 50-day SMA ($369) and then to $433.This level may act as a strong resistance and if the price turns down from it, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA.Cardano (ADA) pierced the 20-day EMA ($1.38) but the buyers could not sustain the price above it. That suggests the bears are attempting to defend this resistance aggressively.If the price dips below $1.30, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to $1.20. The bulls are likely to buy this dip and again attempt to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($1.57).On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the $1.20 support, the pair could slide to $1. This is an important support to watch out for because a break below it could result in long liquidation while a rebound off it could extend the range-bound action for a few more days.Dogecoin (DOGE) had been trading close to the 20-day EMA ($0.27) for the past three days but the bulls could not push the price above it. This may have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders, pulling the price lower today.If the bears sink the price below the $0.21 support, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $0.15. This is the last major support before panic selling could drag the price down to $0.10.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the $0.21 support, it will suggest that bulls are trying to form a higher low. The buyers will then make one more attempt to push the price above the 20-day EMA.If they succeed, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($0.33), which is just above the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern.XRP’s pullback has hit a wall at the 20-day EMA ($0.73). This suggests that sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies to the overhead resistance levels.The bears will now try to pull the price below $0.58. If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to the psychological level at $0.50. This is an important support to watch out for because if it gives way, the decline could extend to the support line of the descending channel.This negative view will invalidate if the pair turns up from the current level or rebounds off $0.58 and rises above $0.75. Such a move will suggest that the bulls are trying to make a comeback. The pair could then rise to the 50-day SMA ($0.93) and later to $1.07.Polkadot (DOT) has turned down from the $16.93 resistance, suggesting that bears are selling on every minor rally. The bears will now try to pull the price to the $13 level. If the price rebounds off this support, the altcoin may extend its consolidation between $13 and $16.93.However, the downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 38 suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If bears sink the price below $13, the DOT/USDT pair could start the next leg of the downtrend that may reach $10 and then $7.50.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA ($18.20). That could result in an up-move to the 50-day SMA and then to $26.50. The bears are likely to defend this level aggressively.The bulls pushed the price above the $18.60 resistance but could not clear the hurdle at the 20-day EMA ($19.49). This suggests that bears continue to sell Uniswap (UNI) on rallies to the strong resistance levels.If the price turns down from the current level, the UNI/USDT pair could drop to $15. A bounce off this support may keep the pair range-bound between $15 and the 20-day EMA for a few days.On the contrary, if the bulls regroup and push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($24.45). This level may again act as stiff resistance but if the bulls arrest the next decline above $18.60, the pair may rally to $30.Related: Coincidence? Bitcoin saw its highs and lows on 'Turnaround Tuesdays' in JuneBitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($537), which is just below the horizontal resistance at $538.11. The bears are likely to defend this level aggressively.If the price turns down from this level, the BCH/USDT pair could drop to $428.43 and then to $370. A bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $370 and $538.11 for the next few days.However, the flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI above 41 suggest the selling pressure is reducing. If bulls propel the price above $538.11, the pair could pick up momentum and rise to the 50-day SMA ($690).Litecoin’s (LTC) relief rally is facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($147). This suggests the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies to strong resistance levels.If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will make another attempt to sink the LTC/USDT pair below the $118 support. If they manage to do that, the pair will complete a descending triangle pattern. This could intensify selling and pull the price down to $100 and later to $70.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off $118 and breaks above the downtrend line, it will invalidate the bearish setup. That could open the gates for a rally to $225.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

333,"Gold is set to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the second quarter of 2021.An ounce of gold has surged from  $1,707.45 on April 1 to over $1,750 in the still-running June 30 session. That marked a roughly 3.9% jump over the quarter. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has plunged by more than 40% to below $35,000 after topping out near $65,000 in mid-April, all in the same period.The inverse correlation between Bitcoin and gold markets surged specifically in April and May 2021. Analysts at JPMorgan noted in May that large institutional investors rotated their money out of the overvalued crypto markets to seek upside opportunities in gold.Referring to the Bitcoin Futures data on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), JPMorgan analysts said that investors have been liquidating their positions from as back as October 2020. Meanwhile, capital inflows into gold-enabled exchange-traded funds have increased in correspondence to Bitcoin market outflows. An excerpt from the report reads:The bank noted that institutional investors may have treated Bitcoin as an overbought asset, especially as the flagship cryptocurrency surged from $3,858 in March 2020 to just shy of $65,000 by April 2021—a 1,584% gain. Meanwhile, gold topped out at $2,075.82 per ounce in August 2020, after which it dropped to as low as $1,676.866 an ounce in March.The rotational investment strategy from Bitcoin to gold also picked momentum after Elon Musk criticized the cryptocurrency for its carbon footprints, insomuch that he suspended accepting it as payment for his Tesla electric car range.  On May 19, right after Musk doubled down his attack on the Bitcoin market, stating that he might have Tesla unload its entire $1.5 billion BTC stash, Bitcoin crashed by roughly 30%. The bearish bias increased also after China announced a complete ban on cryptocurrency activities, including mining-related operations that contributed a large chunk of the Bitcoin network's total computing power.Bitcoin closed the May session at a 35.5% loss. On the other hand, gold benefited from the FUDs in the crypto market, rising 7.6% in the same month.Investors picked gold over Bitcoin as a safer haven also as they feared higher inflation is around the corner. As a result, the precious metal surged 3.78% in April as consumer prices in the US rose at their best momentum in over a decade, to 4.2%. The next month—as stated above—saw gold continuing its rally alongside a similar upside tick in the consumer price index, which surged to 5%.Core PCE, the Federal Reserve's preferred metric to gauge inflation, jumped to at an annual rate of 3.4% in May, the highest in 29 years.Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, appeared adamant about the rising inflation as he called the price rises ""transitory in nature."" He further stressed that the central bank would maintain its expansionary fiscal programs to protect the U.S. economy against the economic aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.Fed has been keeping interest rates near zero and has been purchasing $120 billion worth of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month since March 2020.June appeared as the only month in the second quarter that saw Bitcoin and gold trending in tandem.The assets traded flat in days approaching the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day policy meeting in June's second week. Fed officials announced that they might hike interest rates twice by the end of 2023, a year earlier than anticipated, to contain excessive inflation rates.Both Bitcoin and gold fell in tandem after the Fed's hawkish tone. Gold, in particular, looked at prospects of logging its worth monthly performance in June since 2016. It was down 7.42% at publishing time.Meanwhile, Bitcoin had fallen by more than 8.5% in the same period.A survey of leading economists conducted by Financial Times found that a majority of them expect the Fed to raise interest rates at least twice by the end of 2023, aligning accurately with the central bank officials' dot plot.Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank AG, recommended watching the US dollar to gauge gold's strength in the coming sessions, noting that June's major drag on the precious metal appeared because of a strengthening greenback.The U.S. dollar index, a benchmark to measure the dollar's strength against a basket of top fiat currencies, rose to a one-week high at 92.433 on Wednesday.""Gold repeatedly failed to overcome the 100-day moving average in recent days, which was a bearish sign,"" Fritsch told Bloomberg. ""There is a risk now that so far, patient ETF investors jump on the bandwagon and sell their holdings. This would amplify the downward move.”At the same time, Bitcoin bulls received similar warnings as the cryptocurrency grappled repeatedly with the risks of falling below $30,000, a psychological support level.Jill Carlson, a venture partner at Slow Ventures, told CNBC that institutional outflows from the Bitcoin markets had picked momentum recently, adding that traders need to be ""cautiously bullish"" on the cryptocurrency.Clem Chambers, the CEO of financial analysis portal ADFVN.com, predicted another leg down for Bitcoin, noting that breaking below $30,000 would put the cryptocurrency on the path toward $20,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

The past four weeks have seen the pair deliver either highs or lows within its range each Tuesday, with this week being no exception.""The pattern this month thus far has been for Tuesdays to mark the range swing highs & lows,"" QCP  confirmed on Twitter on June 22.Since then, a brief dip below $30,000 has occurred, with this ""technical alert"" then setting up $30,000 as support.""Leaning on this, we've formed a moderately bullish bias,"" the market update summarized.QCP has a target of just below $40,000 for BTC/USD, with this remaining unfulfilled after this Tuesday's (June 29) high peaked at $36,630.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin price action is, for many analysts, out of step with reality.Related: Institutional investors aren't buying Bitcoin at 50% of all-time highs… for nowAs multiple indicators flash ""oversold"" for BTC/USD, attention is focusing on ridding the market of selling pressure to allow for an organic run-up to challenge resistance levels.This pressure is expected to come from institutional investors in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust when it unlocks a significant tranche of BTC later in July.

335,"Over the years, Bitcoin has been able to overcome naysayers by frequently reinventing its narrative. Because Bitcoin (BTC) is multifaceted, it is able to quickly change to confront new criticism.We have seen this over the years. For example, Bitcoin used to be frequently assailed by the media for its volatility — many articles pushed the notion that Bitcoin was too volatile to ever succeed as a currency. We do not hear too much about Bitcoin’s volatility today, in part because observers have been accustomed to its frequent price swings, but mostly because “Bitcoiners” have coalesced around the notion of Bitcoin as an investment, specifically digital gold. They argue that the only reason BTC experiences such strong price movements is because it has not yet fully matured to a market capitalization that would sap this kind of volatility, such as that of gold. Consequently, the dominant narrative surrounding Bitcoin today is that it is a store of value and inflation hedge, despite continued volatility.Recently, Bitcoin has encountered new obstacles, namely environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns over mining, ransomware and regulatory scrutiny. The Bitcoin community has quickly pivoted to address these concerns, while underneath the surface, the seeds were planted years ago. The Bitcoin community is so large that its members are now in most industries and even in politics. As a result, their work spans areas that have seen limited attention in the past, such as renewable BTC mining.Related: Is Bitcoin a waste of energy? Pros and cons of Bitcoin miningSo, as new challenges arise to the current narrative, attention is suddenly drawn to the areas that Bitcoiners have been working on behind the scenes. The community then coalesces around these to develop a new narrative that is built to become the dominant perception of Bitcoin.The ESG attacks against Bitcoin resurfaced in full force in spring 2021. They generally make the following points:Bitcoiners sprung to action to counteract these notions almost instantly. They said Bitcoin encourages the use of green energy because this may often be among the most efficient, cheapest kind of energy available to mine with. Bitcoin miners that use low-cost renewable energy will be able to earn more than those using costlier, potentially non-renewable energy. Consequently, the BTC mining industry is being pushed toward using renewable energy exclusively over time.Related: Green Bitcoin: The impact and importance of energy use for PoWThey have also rushed to shore up resources and education on how green Bitcoin already is. Research from investment manager VanEck and the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance found that 39% of the total energy consumption from BTC miners comes from renewables and that 76% of Bitcoin miners use renewable energies. This makes Bitcoin greener than many other industries — few of which receive similar scrutiny over how green their energy consumption is.Bitcoiners also make it clear that the energy consumption of Bitcoin is to secure the network, which benefits all network participants. This security helps ensure that the Bitcoin network continues to never go offline, unlike legacy financial networks, which have experienced interruptions and blackouts in the past. So, while Bitcoin’s energy consumption can be significant in absolute terms, the service that the miners provide from that energy is a net benefit to society. If people are content to disregard the consequences of the energy required to run the global financial system, then why do they take issue with the relatively benign energy consumption of Bitcoin, which promises to establish a better and open financial system?Related: Ignore the headlines — Bitcoin mining is already greener than you thinkWe also saw outspoken Bitcoiners, such as Michael Saylor, move to unite the Bitcoin community and miners against misconceptions surrounding Bitcoin’s energy use by forming the Bitcoin Mining Council. BTC miners have been encouraged to be more transparent and forward with their sources of energy. This sort of coordination demonstrates that Bitcoiners are united in efforts to make the network even greener.Attention has also been brought to the BTC miners that have already been using significant renewable energy in their operations. Furthermore, with headlines of 99%+ hydroelectric Bitcoin-miner Bitfarms going public, I anticipate the broader public will be familiar with how green BTC mining actually is. Paired with the push for the above actions and education, Bitcoiners are reworking the narrative about ESG. If they are successful — and I have no doubt they will be — Bitcoin’s potential ESG issues are unlikely to dominate headlines in the future.Related: Blockchain and sustainability — There’s more to it than electricity usageBitcoin as a currency has largely been dismissed, and attention has turned to BTC as an investment. But in the background, there are Bitcoiners who are working hard at pushing BTC adoption around the world and developing the Lightning Network.The recent development in El Salvador — the passage of the “Bitcoin Law” that decrees BTC legal tender in the country — is groundbreaking for the cryptocurrency, although to many it seemed to come out of nowhere. When taking a closer look at the situation, it is clear that the groundwork was laid by Bitcoiners several years ago. Bitcoin Beach, a project seeking to create a sustainable Bitcoin ecosystem in El Salvador, did much of the preparatory work in the country. By seeking to bolster financial inclusion through the use of Bitcoin, it also worked to address the narrative that Bitcoin was not used as currency. And it succeeded. The ramifications for global Bitcoin adoption could be profound if there is a domino effect of countries seeking to adopt BTC as legal tender.Related: El Salvador adopting Bitcoin could make it lose market dominanceTo tackle the thesis that Bitcoin cannot scale enough to be used as a currency, many Bitcoiners have been quietly working on building the Lightning Network over the past several years. While still not perfect, the use and capacity of the network are growing, showing its promise as a scaling solution. Overall, it receives surprisingly little attention. I suspect that sometime in the future, the “sudden” success of scaling solutions will transform Bitcoin’s narrative again: from investment to currency.Thanks to the diligence of Bitcoiners working together to expand Bitcoin adoption, Bitcoin is able to remain antifragile. It has so far been able to overcome all major obstacles, in no small part because Bitcoiners are able to shape its new narrative.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

336,"Bitcoin (BTC) kept traders guessing with rangebound action on June 30 after a push beyond the $37,000 resistance ended in rejection.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed a day of reversal for BTC/USD on Wednesday, with the pair down 4.5% to hit $34,500.After accelerating upward the day before, Bitcoin ran out of steam at $36,630 and began a retracement that erased most of its gains.For popular trader Crypto Ed, even the run higher was lacking in substance, and after the subsequent correction, a bounce was sorely needed to preserve the bull case.""Stronger move down=start of move to green,"" he commented alongside a chart showing a downside target of $26,900.Others heralded the Wyckoff price analysis method, which is currently popular for Bitcoin, as providing key insights into what the short-term price direction could be.Fellow trader Michaël van de Poppe, in his Wyckoff depiction, highlighted an area just above $32,000 as the do-or-die support level for BTC bulls.""That would generate a higher low & strength towards further upwards momentum,"" he told Twitter followers.The Wyckoff method has not been as eagerly accepted by everyone, with Crypto Ed on June 30 criticizing the general lack of understanding of the method's principles and the potential for incorrect conclusions as a result.For on-chain indicators, the story was conversely still bullish, even as one particular indicator left room for another BTC price low.The Puell multiple, a classic indicator for catching undervalued periods in Bitcoin's lifespan, is currently sitting in its broad ""undervalued"" zone for just the fifth time ever.Related: Institutional investors aren't buying Bitcoin at 50% of all-time highs… for nowAs discussed by analyst Rekt Capital in a dedicated video on June 30, the Puell multiple suggests that miners have sold to cover costs, and given its descent to the ""undervalued"" zone, a price bottom could soon appear.The previous four bottoms in the indicator, nonetheless, did not exactly line up with price bottoms, as those generally came shortly after the indicator had reversed upward.""The fact that we're in this green P [Puell] multiple region doesn't necessarily mean to us that we're at the very bottom,"" he commented, referring to the latest chart."
337,"India’s reserve bank has long since condemned the use of cryptocurrencies, but other than the Supreme Court striking down its 2018 bill last year, the Indian government’s stance on cryptocurrencies has been largely uncertain. On one hand, top sources tracking the government’s stance say it has shifted away from the idea of a complete ban. On the other hand, more banks have started barring cryptocurrency-related businesses from accessing their services, including ICICI Bank, Paytm Payments, Yes Bank and, most recently, IDFC First Bank.The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) stance is understandable. As the body responsible for ensuring the country’s ability to absorb financial shocks, it has repeatedly pointed out the risks of using cryptocurrencies. Some banks still cite the 2018 circular as the reason for freezing accounts dealing in cryptocurrencies despite the RBI having repealed it earlier this year.According to reports, India’s market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, will oversee legislation for the cryptocurrency sector once Bitcoin (BTC) becomes classified as an asset class. Sources also suggest an expert panel is being put together to study the technology and that the parliament’s Monsoon session will discuss introducing a cryptocurrency regulation bill.India has taken drastic measures to curb the amount of cash that goes untaxed, including demonetizing its 500- and 1,000-rupee currency notes in 2016. One of the biggest concerns of the Indian government is how cryptocurrency affords a degree of anonymity to its users and how it could be used to finance terrorism, launder money and help with other forms of criminal activity. However, this raises the question of whether cryptocurrency investors should pay the price for the inefficiencies of digital law enforcement.“Ever since the supreme court ruling in March 2020, crypto-related trading has gained immense traction in India, especially among the Millennial and Gen-Z investor community,” Sumit Gupta, CEO of India-based cryptocurrency exchanges CoinDCX, told Cointelegraph, adding, “Well-meaning regulations will help strengthen the crypto ecosystem in our country.”In March, Minister of State Finance Anurag Singh Thakur stated that the government was collecting income tax on cryptocurrency earnings and even collected Goods and Services Tax from exchanges. However, he also noted that the government doesn’t maintain any data on cryptocurrency earnings since it has no means of capturing such information. Gupta added:Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin — one of India’s top exchanges — believes the RBI will eventually come around. “I strongly believe that the RBI is not against any financial innovation, which has the potential to boost the Indian economy and create jobs for the youth,” he said, adding, “The RBI’s main concerns are around the misuse of the power crypto assets have.”However, Sidharth Sogani, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency research firm Crebaco Global, seems much more optimistic about India’s readiness for blockchain technology. “Technologically, we are ready. Regulated environments are easy to live in, [and] will enable the government to monitor crypto transactions,” he said, adding further, “India needs a dedicated department to regulate the crypto space. Not regulating them will only encourage the black market.” Thakral added:The country’s approach to classifying cryptocurrencies as an asset class is positive news for the space since it matches various other countries’ routes to create better frameworks for decentralized currencies.“Cryptocurrencies have been viewed as a digital asset by the Australian Taxation Office for some time now,” said Michael Swan, founding member and chief commercial officer of asset custody service firm Unido. He opined further, “We see the steps taken by India as a natural progression and consistent with the global sentiment.”However, there are concerns surrounding the cryptocurrency regulation bill that is to be introduced in parliament. After the RBI’s circular in 2018, the government set up a panel to report on news pertaining to the crypto space. In 2019, this panel recommended a blanket ban on digital currencies.India’s finance minister has stated that India will not shut down all options for cryptocurrencies, which some construed as a possible ban on private cryptocurrencies, paving the way for a state-backed central bank digital currency (CBDC). However, with the younger generation flocking to digital assets as the older ones did with gold, this could be a huge lost opportunity for Millennials and Generation Z individuals just entering the workforce.The RBI’s inability to provide the supreme court with enough evidence that cryptocurrencies need to be banned means there is some pressure on Indian authorities to allow cryptocurrencies in the country. However, Indian investors, especially the younger ones, are being pushed from confused to disgruntled, as obscure regulation brings the fear of missing out on the giant swings cryptocurrency markets offer.“India is one of the youngest countries with a large number of people who are early adopters of technology. Currently, we see more and more people between the ages of 24 and 40 adopting crypto,” said Gupta. However, when asked about whether India’s plans for a CBDC were seeing any footing, he refused to comment. Sogani added:“After the RBI booklet outlining possible plans for a CBDC, there has not been any media statement around India’s official CBDC,” said Thakral, adding further, “We have seen reports around major banks moving towards blockchain, and it could be a sign that banks are laying the foundation for making a CBDC a reality.”Indian investors appear confident about the industry’s long-term growth despite the recent market crash, and market experts and leaders seem optimistic about how authorities will legislate crypto in the country. Though progress is slow, things appear to be moving, but with a market of close to 1 billion users, India’s stance on crypto is of global concern."
338,"New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) has partnered with the Atlanta-based enterprise payment behemoth NCR to enable Bitcoin (BTC) services for banks and credit unions in the United States.According to Forbes on Wednesday the deal will see 650 banks and credit unions in the U.S. able to provide Bitcoin trading services to their over 24 million customers.Apart from Bitcoin trading for its banking and credit union clients, the NCR is also reportedly eyeing BTC payment services for its almost 200,000 retail clients.NYDIG will reportedly offer its in-house Bitcoin custody solution, removing a major regulatory impediment for community banks and other financial institutions looking to deal in cryptocurrencies.The news follows swiftly on the heels of NYDIG’s partnership with digital banking services provider Q2 as well as global payment channel Fiserv and cloud-based electronic banking outfit Alkami to enable banks to offer Bitcoin trading to an estimated 18 million customers.Indeed, as previously reported by Cointelegraph, NYDIG bank solutions head Patrick Sells stated back in May 2021 that U.S. banks were keen to offer Bitcoin trading in 2021. At the time, Sells opined that the significant outflow of funds to exchanges like Coinbase was forcing lenders in the country to re-examine their previous anti-BTC stance.Related: NYDIG and Q2 partner to enable Bitcoin trading for 18M US bank customersAccording to NCR digital banking chief Douglas Brown, the company’s banking clients were routinely reporting massive outflows of customer's savings to crypto exchanges. For Brown, offering BTC trading avenues will help NCR and its clients capture some of the $1.4 trillion market.The move also expands the NCR’s improvement of the digital finance infrastructure available to its banking and credit union clients. Earlier in the year, the 137-year-old enterprise payment firm acquired software firm Terafina to improve customer onboarding across physical, call center and digital account opening channels.NCR reportedly has plans to custody Bitcoin for its clients while also exploring use cases for non-crypto blockchain applications."
339,"Russia’s central bank has scheduled a risk assessment for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), according to the Bank of Russia’s screening program for the second half of 2021.The examination of the potential risks of cryptocurrency investing will consider “systemic risks linked to cryptocurrency investment by Russian individuals and entities.” As part of the investigation, the Bank of Russia will collect data from 15 credit organizations including major banks like Sberbank, VTB and Tinkoff Bank, payment systems like Visa and Mastercard, and electronic payment providers like Western Union, Qiwi and WebMoney.The Bank of Russia is also looking to release a study on equity investment by non-resident investors by October or November 2021.The Bank of Russia’s assessment of crypto-related risks comes amid growing criticism from local lawmakers and businesspeople regarding the institution's tough stance on the crypto industry.Related: CEOs of top Russian banks Sberbank and VTB blast BitcoinIn mid-June, Russian State Duma member Fedot Tumusov said that the Bank of Russia was short-sighted on crypto while industrial tycoon Oleg Deripaska blasted the central bank for pressuring local industry to avoid cryptocurrencies.Earlier this week, the Bank of Russia established the first pilot group for testing the country’s central bank digital currency, the digital ruble."
340,"Institutional investors are looking for ways to participate in the crypto market without going out of the regulated space or mastering the advanced technology behind Bitcoin (BTC), and asset managers are finding alternative solutions to meet the need.Paris-based investment management company Melanion Capital partnered with index platform Bita to launch the Melanion Bitcoin Exposure Index, according to information shared with Cointelegraph.The index tracks a beta-weighted equities basket exhibiting the highest correlation and revenue exposure to BTC to follow the biggest cryptocurrency’s performance in a traditional investment fund format.Melanion Bitcoin Exposure Index is built to provide investors “with exposure to the daily price movements of Bitcoin through a diversified basket of equities that meets traditional investment fund standards,” the announcement reads. The index would enable banks and asset managers to offer Bitcoin exposure to their clients in various wrappers such as investment funds, exchange-traded funds, certificates or structured products in a European regulatory compliant format.Using Europe- and North America-based companies that operate or invest in the crypto space as a basis, the index is comprised of the 30 companies that are most correlated to Bitcoin, with their weights allocated accordingly. Liquidity filters and weight caps are applied to guarantee the stability and scalability of the Index.Related: Crypto needs a decentralized daily reference rateReminding that the European regulators’ look-through approach renders a majority of Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded products ineligible for institutional investors and funds, Melanion Capital president Jad Comair said that the Melanion Bitcoin Exposure Index closes the gap between Bitcoin and EU regulation. “This index is a true bridge between two worlds,” he added.Since it closely tracks the performance of BTC in a diversified basket and eliminates usual risks like loss or hacking, the index has its own set of advantages in comparison to a straight investment in Bitcoin, Comair said."
341,"Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, has reiterated his criticism of Bitcoin (BTC).Appearing on episode 10 of the Moneycontrol Masterclass program, the NYU professor doubled down on his longstanding repudiation of Bitcoin as currency.According to Damodaran, Bitcoin’s limited use in microtransactions flies in the face of claims that BTC is viable as a form of money, stating:For the NYU professor dubbed Wall Street’s “dean of valuation,” Bitcoin’s only claim to fame is in the returns earned by early investors. “When I run into Bitcoin enthusiasts, they seem to push this notion that Bitcoin is a great currency because they’ve made a lot of money on it,” Damodaran said.The NYU professor has previously offered similar variants of this anti-Bitcoin commentary revolving around BTC not being a viable form of currency. During the bull market run of 2017, Damodaran argued that market capitalization growth was not a suitable metric to determine Bitcoin’s success.Back in April, Damodaran identified volatility and high transaction costs as major impediments to Bitcoin’s viability as a medium of exchange. The NYU professor’s critique does not, however, account for growing BTC adoption in the face of financial censorship in many places across the globe.Related: Ether is a better commodity than Bitcoin, says NYU ProfessorApart from dismissing Bitcoin as currency, Damodaran also disagreed with the notion that BTC is a hedge against inflation. According to the NYU professor, BTC behaved like a risky stock during the market upheaval of March 2020.Damodaran did not mention that Bitcoin closed out 2020 with a seven-fold price increase against the Black Thursday crash of March 2020.The professor’s pivot from bashing Bitcoin as a currency to repudiating it as an asset class also seems to be an emerging theme. Back in May, Damodaran stated that Ether (ETH) stood a better chance of becoming a commodity than BTC."
342,"Despite BNY Mellon’s entrance into Bitcoin (BTC), the CEO of one of the company’s asset management units is still sceptical about major risks associated with the world’s largest cryptocurrency.Francesca Fornasari, head of currency solutions at BNY Mellon’s subsidiary Insight Investment, believes that Bitcoin may not be suitable for most institutional investors due to extreme volatility, low liquidity, governance issues and environment-related risks.In a Tuesday Bloomberg interview, Fornasari said that Bitcoin can be more difficult to evaluate than gold due to its massive price swings, which further complicates its possible reactions in an inflationary environment. “At the end of the day, you should be aware of the fact that if you’re investing in Bitcoin, there’s a whole number of different factors and considerations that are going to affect the value of your investment, that have nothing to do with inflation or inflation hedges,” she said.The foreign exchange expert stated that Bitcoin’s slow and expensive transactions could be a major impediment to mainstream adoption. “We’re skeptical in terms of the ability of Bitcoin to take over as a means of payment,” Fornasari said.However, Insight Investment is optimistic about altcoins, or other cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin and expects to see a rise in such digital assets, particularly those that solve issues like the speed and cost of transactions, energy usage and volatility, according to Fornasari.Related: Bitcoin needs clear regulations to be less volatile, Bridgewater analyst saysInsight Investment is one of the largest global asset management companies with around $1 trillion in assets under management. The company has been a subsidiary of BNY Mellon since 2009 after the U.S. banking giant acquired it from Lloyds Banking Group.The firm’s sceptical stance on Bitcoin comes despite BNY Mellon actively moving into Bitcoin after the bank announced its plans to custody and transfer Bitcoin and other crypto as an asset manager in February this year. The firm also argued that underperformance of one of its exchange-traded funds was caused by the lack of exposure to companies investing in Bitcoin."
343,"Institutions are holding their breath when it comes to buying more Bitcoin (BTC), even at $34,000.According to data on BTC balances held by major exchange Coinbase, not much mass-buying has occurred in recent weeks.Despite BTC/USD trading at over 50% below its recent all-time highs, there is curiously little interest among many investors in buying up the supply.Whether retail or institutional, adding Bitcoin to portfolios appears to be simply not as attractive as before, even with a conspicuous “discount.”“I know this is getting old, but Coinbase Bitcoin exchange balances still continue to go sideways,” researcher Jan Wuestenfeld commented on the data, which was tracked by on-chain analytics service Glassnode.Coinbase’s BTC balance saw consecutive steps down throughout 2021. The trend was consistent until mid-May’s price capitulation event when withdrawals conspicuously stopped. Since then, Coinbase has seen only small decreases in its Bitcoin reserves.As Cointelegraph reported, July is set to see a shake-up in terms of institutional activity thanks to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.In mid-July, a major unlocking event will give a large slice of the investor base a chance to sell their funds. Should they choose to do so, selling pressure is implied, and the potential for Bitcoin's price to slide further down could be the reason why there is currently little interest in buying.The event is important — once over, selling pressure overall is expected to decrease significantly.When it comes to selling behavior, meanwhile, it is conspicuously short-term holders (STRs) who are behind the routs that saw lows of $28,600.Related: Active Bitcoin miners now ‘unlikely’ sellers thanks to profit boost — DataAs Glassnode noted in the latest of its weekly reports, ""The Week On-chain,"" the mood very much appears to be one of panic selling — new investors are ridding themselves of BTC at a loss.“A very large volume of coins that were underwater were spent this week,” Glassnode explained."
344,"The Australia Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is seeking public feedback on on crypto-asset exchange-traded products (ETPs), stating that it is aware of rising interest and demand in their launch on regulated Australian markets.In a consultation paper released June 30, the regulator said its top priority was to assess whether the “unique and ever evolving features” of crypto-asset ETPs could meet existing regulatory obligations in a consistent fashion. Given this complexity and the fast pace of change in the industry, ASIC notes it deems it necessary to consult widely in order to assess the two key issues at stake:ASIC's paper indicates that the regulator does not consider that all crypto assets are currently able to serve as appropriate underlying assets for an ETP, taking into account its assessment of the maturity of the industry's spot and the level of regulation of its futures market. However, the regulator is open to approving a crypto asset ETP that could meet all its relevant assessment criteria. Here, the regulator notes:ASIC's initiative appears to have been galvanized both by the recent listing of an Ethereum ETP on the Toronto Stock Exchange — something that ASIC explicitly notes in its paper — and ongoing considerations by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) of several crypto ETP applications.In recent months, ASIC has become increasingly proactive in reaching out to domestic blockchain and crypto firms and has been attempting to build trust and collaborate with the crypto economy. The regulator has, however, received criticism from some of these firms for the perceived opacity of existing regulations and crypto companies' compliance obligations.In its statement, ASIC stresses that the way in which crypto assets themselves are classified and regulated in Australia is a question for the government. The Senate Select Committee on Australia has been assessing options for the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto and digital assets, and ASIC emphasizes that its paper does “not seek to pre-determine any decision the Committee may make.”Related: VanEck and BetaShares apply for Aussie crypto ETFs as family offices snap up BTCFeedback from the public will need to be submitted to ASIC by July 27. Respondents can choose to submit their responses openly, anonymously or using an alias. Speaking with Cointelegraph, BetaShares founder and CEO Alex Vynokur addressed ASIC's consultation question as to whether it would be appropriate to offer retail investors exposure to crypto assets underlying ETPs through a licensed Australian market. Vynokur said that BetaShares, as a local provider of ETP's and other ASX-traded funds, holds the view that this approach would offer consumers better protection than direct access through exchanges.Vynokur also agreed with the proposal that regulated investment products like ETPs should be limited to a “small subset of crypto-assets, that can demonstrate robust liquidity, transparency and price discovery.”"
345,"Bitcoin’s reliance on large-scale mining infrastructure and geographic concentration has been thrown into sharp relief by China’s recent mining crackdown. In May, China announced that it would be getting tough on crypto mining and trading as a response to financial risks. The nation’s crackdown on crypto is not new, rather it's a reiteration of previous standings on the risks of digital currency to economic stability, in response to recent price fluctuations.For the first time, cryptocurrency miners are being targeted to enforce the existing guidelines. Mining hardware still presents a potential risk, even if mining moves to other locations. This could prove that the Ethereum blockchain’s switch to proof-of-stake (PoS), which can run on consumer-grade equipment, is a more reliable path to decentralization and offers greater resilience against such risks.Bitcoin (BTC) mining is reliant on large-scale, industrial cryptocurrency mining farms and has been largely concentrated in China, which accounts for 65% of the global hash rate. The manufacture of custom hardware in China has supported this trend, with one in two ASIC miners produced being distributed to Chinese miners. The crackdown has caused significant turmoil in Bitcoin markets.The Bitcoin network’s hash rate has dropped to a 12-month low, with more provinces directing miners to shut down. Uncertainty about what may happen with confiscated mining hardware has hit the overall network hard. This is a massive loss to what was a multi billion-dollar industry for Chinese miners.China’s policy position on Bitcoin seeks “financial stability and social order” and is possibly the result of geopolitical interests related to the desire to remove competitors to its own national digital currency, the digital yuan, in addition to its stated goals of lowering carbon emissions and redirecting energy toward other industries. The swift crackdown has shown that Bitcoin’s reliance on industrial-scale mining farms, hardware supply chains and electricity — all of which are reliant on government policies — may be its Achilles’ heel.Miners are now seeking to migrate to cool climates, cheap energy and “crypto-friendly” jurisdictions. This may open up healthy competition for other crypto-friendly policy positions in other jurisdictions to attract industry participants — as we’ve seen, for example, with Wyoming’s embrace of legislation friendly to decentralized autonomous organizations and crypto in general. Yet, it is unclear whether moving the hardware will keep it out of the reach of policy crackdowns.Hardware has always been a major vulnerability in decentralized infrastructure. In blockchain-based cryptocurrency networks that run on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm, such as Bitcoin, the commonly agreed record of transactions relies on a distributed network of computers.This is vulnerable to structural exploitations, including concentration of hardware mining in industrial-scale factories in certain geographies (such as China), “premining” cryptocurrency with upgraded hardware that is not yet available to the broader market (such as new model ASICs), or supply chain delays.Having a majority of hashing power concentrated in one country, reliant on expensive hardware setups, and subject to regulatory crackdown is antithetical to the “decentralized” ethos of Bitcoin that was outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto. The initial vision of Bitcoin in its white paper was a peer-to-peer system, whereby infrastructure could be run by individuals on a general-purpose computer in a distributed way (via CPU mining), so that the entire network could not be shut down by targeting a single point of failure.This may also show why Ethereum’s move to PoS consensus is important — and why it has the potential to be more reliable and decentralized in the long term. Attacking a PoS network is more costly in time and money than the cost of hiring or buying hardware to attack a PoW blockchain, as an attacker’s coins can be automatically “slashed.”Furthermore, it is much less conspicuous to run a PoS validator node on a laptop than it is to run a large-scale hardware mining operation. If anyone can run a node from anywhere with consumer-grade equipment, then more people can participate in validating the network, making it more decentralized, and regulators would find it almost impossible to stop people from running nodes. In contrast, the huge energy-consuming factories found in Bitcoin mining are much more easily targeted.Mining is on the move, with miners moving their hardware to nearby areas, including Kazakhstan and Russia. Some crypto-friendly jurisdictions — such as Texas, which is offering legal clarity for companies — are racing to attract miners. Hardware is also on sale, with logistics firms reporting thousands of pounds of mining machines being shipped to the United States to sell.Although China’s policy has caused some fear, uncertainty and doubt in the market, it may help to remove structural vulnerabilities from the network, which is why some Bitcoin supporters have welcomed the crackdown. The aim here for Bitcoiners is long-term decentralization. Yet, moving hardware is not the same as further decentralizing the network and removing vulnerabilities to regulatory crackdowns on miners.Hardware is a hard problem in decentralized networks. Bitcoin’s requirement for large-scale infrastructure has made it vulnerable to the policies and politics of countries like China. Even if mining moves elsewhere, it may not be decentralized, meaning it could come under threat in other jurisdictions in a way that PoS networks relying on software that can run on a standard laptop likely will not.Related: Hashing out a future: Is Bitcoin hash rate drop an opportunity in disguise?These events demonstrate the interdependencies between blockchains and nation-state politics and interests. How jurisdictions respond to the opportunity to attract hardware mining, along with how they approach blockchains that are transitioning to PoS, will have significant implications for the structure and risks to blockchain networks in the long term."
346,"Cryptocurrency prices surged on June 29 as Bitcoin (BTC) price pushed through the $35,000 resistance level and lifted the total market cap by $93 billion, with $50 billion of that total flooding into altcoins.Bitcoin put on a 7% gain on the day to climb back above $36,000 and leading traders to expect a rally to the $38,000 to $41,000 level if (BTC) can flip the $35,000 level into support.As the market turned green, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro tracked notable bullish developments in a number of select altcoins including Polygon (MATIC), SushiSwap (SUSHI) and PancakeSwap (CAKE). The first coin that has been gaining traction lately is Polygon (MATIC), an Ethereum (ETH) network layer-two solution, whose price has increased 35% since its swing low price of $0.93 on June 22 as BTC crashed below $29,000.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for MATIC on June 27, prior to the recent price rise.As seen on the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for MATIC hit 80 and turned green on June 27 just as the price of MATIC began to rally 21% from $1.03 to $1.25 over the next 48-hours.The NewsQuake™ alert system caught the news of MATIC being listed at OKEx on June 28 and this was followed by a rise in the VORTECS™ Score to a high of 91 and a price rally of 10% on June 29.SushiSwap (SUSHI) was also identified as a strong mover by Cointelegraph Markets Pro after the asset's VORTECS™ Score turned bullish.As seen in the chart above, market conditions for SUSHI have been favorable for some time with its VORTECS™ Score turning dark green and registering a score of 80 on June 27, just four hours before the price increased 30% from $6.47 to $8.45 over the next two days. SUSHI's price is now up 42% from its swing-low price of $3.96, which occurred on June 22.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro also signaled a bullish VORTECS™ Score for PancakeSwap (CAKE), a Binance Smart Chain-based automated market maker and decentralized exchange.As seen on the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for CAKE has been in the green for the majority of the past week, with a score of 72 registering on June 27, roughly five hours before its price began to rally 21% from $11.83 to $14.44 over the next two days. CAKE's price is now up 50% from its swing-low price of $9.64, which also occurred on June 22.The strength seen across the altcoin market the past two days is in large part thanks to the strong performance of Bitcoin, which finally pushed above the $35,000 resistance and currently trades at $36,400.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that after trading in a range between $35,300 and $33,850 on Monday, the price of Bitcoin climbed 6.65% on Tuesday from a low of $34,200 to an intraday high at $36,509.Traders have now set their sights on the $41,000 resistance level as the next obstacle to overcome in the short term. #BTC (4h)

347,"Often a figure of ridicule within the crypto community thanks to his outlandish predictions as well as being a larger-than-life personality, John McAfee has ceased to be in the spotlight of the crypto community. However, following his alleged “suicide” that occurred in a Spanish prison cell on June 23, tributes have been flowing en masse for the tech savant, who was also an early proponent of digital currencies — especially Bitcoin (BTC) and later Monero (XMR).McAfee had been in exile for the last few years of his life. In this regard, it has been widely reported that the creator of McAfee Antivirus had been on the run from the United States authorities for evading his tax liabilities, which were touted to be worth over $4 million. In all, he had been named in a total of 10 federal indictments and was ordered to be extradited to the U.S. mere hours before the news of his suicide surfaced.After being apprehended by local authorities at Barcelona airport last year, McAfee seemed to have acclimatized quite well to his prison surroundings. “I have friends. The food is good. All is well” he tweeted in October 2020. This, in the eyes of former National Security Agency operative and whistleblower Edward Snowden, seemed to suggest that the U.S. legal system was so fractured that even native-born defendants “would rather die in a prison cell abroad” than become subject to such an unfair system.One of the strangest aspects of this entire development is that over the course of the last few years, McAfee repeatedly emphasized the fact that American officials had been sending him subtle yet fairly explicit messages suggesting that his time here was nearly done and that he was going to be “suicided” soon.On the subject, one of his tweets alarmingly read: “U.S. officials saying, in effect: ‘We’re coming for you, McAfee! We’re going to kill yourself.’ I got a tattoo today just in case. If I suicide myself, I didn’t. I was whackd. Check my right arm.”Not only that, in one of his statements, he made it clear that in case he was ever found hanging in his cell, it would be through no fault of his own but rather an attempt “a la Epstein” to silence him. McAfee claimed that he had a lot of inside dirt on many of the world’s elites, government organizations, etc., even going as far as saying that he was going to start “naming names” — including a top-ranked Central Intelligence Agency employee who had directly been involved in a lot of sketchy business.Furthermore, in an interview given by McAfee’s widow, Janice, on June 25, she claimed that the British-American tycoon was not even the least bit “suicidal” when she last spoke to him, which was apparently just a few hours before his body was discovered in his cell.And while authorities claim that there is nothing suspicious about the tech titan’s death, following the aforementioned revelations, people all over social media have been saying that there might have been “foul play” involved.Lastly, just a day before his untimely death, Spain’s National Court announced that it had come to an agreement with U.S. authorities regarding McAfee’s extradition — with the final decision still pending and subject to additional judicial inquiry. In fact, McAfee and his legal counsel had already devised a plan of action to appeal the decision, further suggesting that the pressure of the extradition alone may have not caused McAfee to resort to suicide.Shortly after news of his demise started doing rounds online, calls for McAfee’s death being planned started to gain a lot of traction. Firstly, the flames were ignited when McAfee’s official Instagram account shared an image of the letter “Q,” supposedly shortly after his death.The “Q” in question here is in direct reference to the QAnon conspiracy theory that suggests that a group of elite pedophiles run a global child sex trafficking ring and have a direct say in how the American administration runs. What’s more, the theory also suggests that this cabal of high-ranked elites can manipulate the global economy thanks to their control of the fractional banking system.As expected, as a result of the post, a large number of QAnon influencers on Telegram started sharing images claiming that McAfee was just another sacrificial pawn — much like Jeffery Epstein — and had to be “suicided” due to the secrets he possessed regarding those in power across the globe.In a tweet from late 2019, McAfee noted in no uncertain terms that if he were to ever “disappear” mysteriously, he would release some 31-plus terabytes of incriminating data (related to various government officials as well as those in positions of power) to the media. However, even as people all over the world continue to wait quite eagerly for this information, no such data seems to have been made available so far.In fact, he even allegedly wrote in a message that he has a stash of sensitive data that is backed up in a number of hard drives and has been stored in his condo near 88th Street, north of Miami Beach. That said, a quick look at McAfee’s feed shows no such post, suggesting that the message may have been tweeted and later deleted or could have been a total figment of imagination, to begin with.Over the last couple of years, McAfee had continued to associate himself with many conspiracies, as is made evident by the fact that in one of his posts, he depicted himself standing in front of Jeffrey Epstein, the multi-millionaire and convicted sex offender, who was also the victim of an alleged “forced suicide.”As part of the photo’s caption in his “Q” Instagram post, he added: “I never said Jeffrey Epstein was murdered. I said he didn’t commit suicide. Not the same. Could be alive. Could have never existed. Maybe murdered. I dunno. I only know he didn’t commit suicide.”Lastly, the tech entrepreneur had recently even launched a cryptocurrency called $WHACKD that advertised itself with an image of Hillary Clinton eating pizza. The asset seemed to be a direct reference to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which garnered a lot of traction a couple of years ago after the former Secretary of State’s emails were leaked online through Wikileaks.Born in 1945 to an American father who was serving in the army and stationed in the United Kingdom at the time, McAfee received his Ph.D. in mathematics before making his way to Silicon Valley in the late-1970s. Within a decade and a half, he was not only working for Lockheed but also spending a substantial portion of his personal time looking at software solutions that could help combat the growing problem of computer viruses.In the early 90s, John established McAfee Associates from the comfort of his home and started devising novel solutions to help combat various digital threats that were prevalent at the time. As a result, before the dawn of the new millennium, the company was already raking in close to $5 million a year.Following his passing, the tributes have been flowing in from all sides. For example, Bitcoin influencer and podcaster Anthony Pompliano shared a post remembering McAfee as a “kind, funny, and incredibly intelligent,” individual. Similarly, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, too, spoke highly of McAfee’s contributions to the domain of computer sciences, calling the man “one of the most enigmatic and interesting people in the cryptocurrency space and the history of computing.”While there will always be people who either believe or disbelieve the narrative that the U.S. government had a role to play in McAfee’s death, the fact of the matter is that he did claim that he had a lot of dirt on the global elites. Now, whether or not any of this so-called classified information makes its way to the internet remains to be seen.That, however, does not take away from the fact that McAfee was not only a true pioneer in the field of digital security but also a visionary who could foresee the rise of cryptocurrencies even when the space was in its infancy.Conspiracies aside, the tech pioneer will be sorely missed by many."

349,"Bitcoin (BTC) tackled resistance at $35,000 on Tuesday as upward momentum began to resurface throughout cryptocurrency.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting 24-hour highs of $35,780 on Bitstamp on Tuesday.The pair put in 4.5% gains on the day, restoring confidence to traders who were previously afraid of another major market correction.As Cointelegraph reported, the weekend was a rags-to-riches story for Bitcoin, which bounced at $30,000 to stage an impressive comeback going into the new week.For popular trader Crypto Ed, there was now little reason to hold a doomsday-style view on BTC’s price action.“Current BTC bears are the same who were convinced BTC would drop below $10k back in September 2020,” he argued in his latest update. For analyst Rekt Capital, the potential likewise remained for further upside on the back of the most recent weekly close.“Great price-strength stability at a key Weekly support level for BTC,” he summarized.A look at orderbook data from Binance, the largest exchange by volume, showed strong support remaining in place at $30,000 but less presence of buy interest between that level and spot price around $35,500.Sellers, on the other hand, remained at both $37,000 and $40,000.Altcoins, meanwhile, were keen to capitalize on Bitcoin’s newfound strength, broadly outperforming BTC gains on the day. Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market capitalization, was up 9% at the time of writing, trading at nearly $2,200.Related: Active Bitcoin miners now 'unlikely' sellers thanks to profit boost — DataTraders were keenly eyeing the potential for a fresh installment of “alt season” should Bitcoin add to its losses or make more cautious gains. “Looking good so far,” Scott Melker told Twitter followers.Bitcoin’s market cap dominance stood at 46% on Tuesday, slightly down, while the overall cryptocurrency market cap was $1.455 trillion."
350,"Small-scale hydroelectric plants in China are reportedly looking for new customers as crypto miners go abroad amid a nationwide crackdown on mining activity.According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), advertisements for small-scale hydro plants with 50-megawatt capacity have surged on Chinese secondhand e-commerce platforms such as Xianyu. According to the SCMP, some sellers claimed that their listings were unrelated to the cryptocurrency mining industry, while others said that their bids came as a result of the recent crackdown on crypto mining. One seller reportedly said that small dams rely on crypto miners for a customer base because they have not obtained approval from state authorities and environmental protection agencies to connect to the power grid. “You can secretly mine cryptocurrency if you buy a hydropower station,” one seller told the SCMP.The news comes as Chinese Bitcoin (BTC) miners are capitulating or relocating their operations to other countries. Bitmain, the largest crypto mining equipment provider in the world, reportedly halted global spot sales for its new crypto miners last week in order to avoid losses by customers amid massive selling on the secondary market. A number of key industry players including Bitmain’s rival Canaan and major mining pool BTC.com have been relocating operations to more crypto mining-friendly countries such as Kazakhstan.Related: Nvidia GPU prices in China fall amid crypto mining crackdownMeanwhile, the price of GPUs in the mainland has dropped dramatically.

351,"Major global interdealer broker TP ICAP is launching a cryptocurrency trading platform with Fidelity Investments and British banking giant Standard Chartered.TP ICAP’s upcoming crypto exchange is scheduled for launch in the second half of 2021 and will initially offer trading exclusively for Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Reuters reported Tuesday. Other digital assets like Ether (ETH) will be added at a later stage.Unlike the majority of typical crypto exchanges, TP ICAP’s crypto trading platform will offer post-trade infrastructure with a network of digital asset custodians as well as separate execution and settlement, intending to cut credit risks. The platform will use Standard Chartered’s digital assets custody unit known as Zodia custody, an institutional-grade crypto custody solution launched in December 2020. Amsterdam-based market maker Flow Traders will provide liquidity to the platform.According to the report, the platform is awaiting approval from the United Kingdom’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. Neither Standard Chartered nor Fidelity Investments have invested in the platform, TP ICAP told reporters.Duncan Trenholme, TP ICAP’s co-head of digital assets, said that investor demand for crypto as a new asset class has exploded over the past six to eight months. “In most of our conversations with clients, they want a separation of custodial roles from execution capabilities which is opposite to the models that exist currently,” he noted.Related: Standard Chartered plans European crypto exchange after HSBC says 'no' to industryTP ICAP has been actively moving into crypto in recent years, introducing a number of crypto-related services.

352,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners are “unlikely” to pressure BTC price by selling coins in the coming weeks, new data says.As part of its latest weekly report, “The Week On-chain,” analytics resource Glassnode sought to allay fears of another large miner sell-off.Amid the ongoing transfer of mining equipment — and, therefore, Bitcoin’s hash rate — out of China, fears have emerged over miners selling BTC to cover costs and liquidations.Given the magnitude of the geographical changes — the China rout marks the largest hash rate shake-up in history — miners could compound selling pressure by disposing of coins that may not otherwise have moved in a long time.The combined impact of selling and the reduced hash rate offers a “double whammy” for Bitcoin’s price action, reducing the potential for gains or even maintaining significant support levels.For Glassnode, however, the situation appears to be already under control. Miners are in transit, it notes, and those still online face a giant windfall.This is because later this week, Bitcoin’s difficulty will drop by almost 25% — again, the biggest move down ever — meaning it will be more profitable to mine Bitcoin for the remaining miners.As such, there should be less incentive to sell, as network participants will be in an upward spiral of profitability until the missing hash rate returns and difficulty increases.“The Bitcoin mining puzzle is 23.6% harder despite revenues being up 154% on a 7-day average basis,” the report explains.Glassnode added that miners are more likely to be liquidating coins amassed over time as part of the move.“This largely indicates that miners who are in operation are unlikely to exert excessive compulsory selling... and thus it is more probable that Chinese miners liquidating treasuries is the dominant sell-side source,” it concluded.A separate source, meanwhile, highlighted just how profitable mining could be under current circumstances.Related: World’s first Bitcoin ETF adds $3M per day throughout BTC price dipUsing data that puts Bitcoin’s energy usage at around 2,520 gigawatt-hours per two-week difficulty period, writer Hass McCook underscored the 75% profit opportunity open to miners with specific operating and capital expenditure.If it costs at the most $20,000 to mine 1 BTC, the difference between that expenditure and spot price, which was $34,500 at the time of writing, is plain.“So if the cost to mine a coin is about $20k in the absolute worst of cases (probably closer to $13-14k for the professional shops now), how hard would you work right now to capture the 75%+ profit available to you...?” McCook concluded."
353,"The latest announcement from El Salvador's pro-Bitcoin president, Nayib Bukele, has clarified that citizens will not be forced to use the government-issued “Chivo” Bitcoin wallet.In a tweet on June 29, El Salvador’s President Bukele stated he wanted to clear up any misinformation regarding the government’s wallet application following the passing of the country’s Bitcoin law on June 9, which will take effect on September 7.The new Bitcoin wallet is called Chivo, which is slang for “cool” in El Salvador, and it can hold both Bitcoin and U.S. dollars.

354,"Self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin SV proponent Craig Wright has won a legal battle claiming copyright infringement on the part of Bitcoin.org for hosting the Bitcoin white paper.Wright won by default after the website’s pseudonymous owner, “Cøbra,” chose not to mount a defense.Bitcoin.org must now remove the white paper and display a notice referring to the judgment and cough up at least 35,000 British pounds ($48,600) to cover Wright’s legal costs. Cøbra responded to the ruling on Twitter: I don't think you could get a better advertisement of *why* Bitcoin is necessary than what happened today.

355,"Although bulls made a show of force in the morning trading hours, Bitcoin (BTC) price is still pinned under the $35,000 resistance and unable to flip the 20-day moving average to support or secure a daily close above the level. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView since rallying to $35,400 on June 28, Bitcoin has traded in a range between $33,850 and $35,000 as the fallout from China’s crackdown on BTC mining continues to reverberate across the market.In addition to turning the Bitcoin mining ecosystem on its head, China's government also turned the screw on local cryptocurrency exchanges, resulting in the closure of BTCChina.

356,"Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to stage a relief rally but analysts at JPMorgan Chase believe that the short-term setup looks challenging. However, the analysts also pointed out that the crypto markets had started a healing process.A sign of this 'healing process' was seen when the crypto markets did not react negatively to the news that the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority banned Binance Markets Limited from undertaking “any regulated activity in the UK.”When a market reacts negatively to bad news, it is a sign that weaker hands are panicking and dumping their positions. On the other hand, a muted reaction to negative news indicates that investors are not falling prey to FUD, which is a sign of strength.The crypto sentiment may have received a boost due to the strong support for Bitcoin from Mexico’s third-richest man Ricardo Salinas Pliego. The billionaire tweeted that he recommended the use of Bitcoin and was also working with his bank to make it the first in Mexico to accept Bitcoin.With the sentiment turning positive, can Bitcoin pull the crypto sector higher? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin is again facing resistance at the 20-day exponential moving average ($35,252) but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. The positive divergence on the relative strength index suggests that the bears may be losing their grip.If buyers propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($38,603). This level may act as a resistance but if the bulls can push the price above it, the pair may rise to $42,451.67.The bears are likely to defend the $42,451.67 level aggressively. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce off this support will suggest that the sentiment has turned positive and that will increase the possibility of a break above $42,451.67.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears may pull the price to the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone. A break and close below this zone could intensify selling and clear the path for a decline to $20,000.Ether (ETH) again bounced off the $1,728.74 support on June 26, indicating accumulation at that level. The bulls will now try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,178). If they manage to do that, the biggest altcoin could rally to the downtrend line.However, this is not going to be easy because the downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that bears are at an advantage. The failure to break and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA could attract another round of selling.If bears sink the price below $1,728.74, the selling could pick up momentum as traders who may have purchased the recent dips could rush to the exit. The ETH/USDT pair could then start the next leg of the downtrend that may reach $1,536.92.Binance Coin (BNB) turned down from just below the 20-day EMA ($320) on June 25 but the bears could not pull the price down to the critical support at $211.70. This suggests that bulls are trying to form a higher low at $264.26.However, the downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 42 suggest that the bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to pull the price below $264.26. If they do that, the pair could drop to the critical support at $211.70.A break and close below this support may start the next leg of the downtrend that could stretch to $126.75. On the other hand, if the bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($383) and then to $433.Cardano (ADA) has been trading between the 20-day EMA ($1.39) and $1.20 for the past four days. This suggests that the bulls are attempting to form a higher low at $1.20.If the bulls can drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($1.58). This level may act as a resistance but if the buyers can propel the price above it, the pair may rally to $1.94.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is above 45, suggesting that bulls have a good chance to make a comeback. This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $1.20. That could pull the price down to $1.Dogecoin (DOGE) could not rise above the 20-day EMA ($0.27) on June 25 but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground in the past two days. This suggests a lack of aggressive selling by the bears.If the bulls do not allow the price to drop below $0.21, the possibility of the DOGE/USDT pair breaking above the 20-day EMA increases. The pair will again face stiff resistance at the neckline of the head and shoulder pattern.A break above it will be the first indication that the correction may be over. On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $0.21, a retest of $0.15 is likely. A break below this level could start the next leg of the downtrend to $0.10.The bears do not seem to be willing to wait for XRP to reach the 20-day EMA ($0.74) before shorting. This suggests that the sentiment is bearish and traders expect further downside from the current levels.If the bears sink the price below the psychological support at $0.50, the selling could intensify and the XRP/USDT pair could drop to the support line of the descending channel. This level may act as a support but the extent of the pullback will give clarity whether the correction is over or not.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls push the price above the $0.75 resistance, it will signal strong buying at lower levels. The pair could then move up to the 50-day SMA ($0.96) and then to $1.07.Polkadot (DOT) is currently stuck in a tight range between $13 and $16.93. A tight consolidation near a critical support indicates weakness and it usually resolves in favor of the bears.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating that bears are in control. A break and close below $13 could open the doors for a further decline to $10 and then to $7.50.On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($18.72), it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The DOT/USDT pair could then rally to the overhead resistance at $26.50.Uniswap (UNI) has been trading in a tight range of $15.10 to $18.60 for the past few days. The bulls are currently trying to push the price above this range and the 20-day EMA ($19.86), but it is not going to be easy.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears are in control. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will try to sink the UNI/USDT pair below $15.If that happens, the pair may challenge the critical support at $13. A break below this level could extend the downtrend to $10 and later to $7.Alternatively, if the bulls propel and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($25.24). This level may act as a resistance but if the bulls can push the price above it, the rally may reach $30.Related: Biggest ever mining difficulty drop: 5 things to watch in Bitcoin this weekThe bulls are attempting to push Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to the breakdown level at $538.11. This is an important resistance to watch out for because the 20-day EMA ($543) is just above it. Therefore, the bears will try to defend the resistance aggressively.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 43 indicate that bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will once again try to pull the BCH/USDT pair to $370.This is an important support and if the price rebounds off it, the pair may consolidate between $370 and $538.11 for a few days. Conversely, a break below $370 could start a decline to the next support at $300.Litecoin (LTC) rebounded off the $118 support on June 26 but the bounce lacks strength. This suggests a lack of aggressive buying by the bulls at the current levels.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, suggesting that bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA ($148), the sellers will try to pull the price below the $118 to $104.92 support zone.If they succeed, the LTC/USDT pair will complete a descending triangle pattern, which could result in a fall to $70. Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the bearish setup will be invalidated. That could start an up-move to the 50-day SMA ($192) and later to $166.45.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

357,"The cryptocurrency market found itself in a state of cautious optimism on Monday after Bitcoin’s (BTC) price briefly spiked above $35,500, renewing hopes that the bull trend will resume shortly.Despite the bullish move, some analysts have warned that the failure to secure a daily close above the $35,000 resistance level is a sign that traders are simply closing positions at each breakout to resistance — a hint that further downside could be in store. According to David Puell, on-chain analyst and creator of the Puell Multiple, the indicator has just given its fifth Bitcoin buy signal in history.$BTC: Getting reports that the most awesomely-named indicator just gave its fifth buy signal in BTC history.

Looking good, yes, but remember that Puell Multiple reacts to hash rate movements too, and hash rate follows price, not the other way around.The Puell Multiple focuses on the supply side of the Bitcoin economy, mainly Bitcoin miners and their revenue, and explores market cycles from a mining revenue perspective.It is calculated by dividing the daily issuance value of BTC (in United States dollars) by the 365-day moving average of daily issuance value.As seen in the chart above, the indicator measures periods where the daily value of the Bitcoin issued reaches historic lows, represented by the green box, or historically high values, which are seen when the indicator climbs into the red box.Past instances when the Puell Multiple has indicated good buying opportunities include mid-2018, when the price of BTC crashed below $4,000 amid the crypto winter and again in March 2020 when prices collapsed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.It also provided traders with a sell signal in late 2017 as the price of BTC topped out at that cycle’s high point, as well during the Bitcoin bull market of 2013.The recent struggles for Bitcoin have been exacerbated by the crackdown on mining in China, which prompted numerous large mining farms to shut down and relocate to other countries. Analysts now expect the largest drop in mining difficulty ever as the hash rate plunges from historic highs.While miners are generally viewed as compulsory sellers due to their need to cover the fixed costs involved in operating a mining operation, recent selling behavior has been followed by the 50% draw-down in price, which means twice as much BTC needs to be sold to cover the same costs in fiat as well as increased expenses incurred by miners shifting their operations out of China.Related: Iranian trade ministry issues 30 crypto mining licensesCautious traders may be focused on the fact that past instances of significant declines in the hash rate have been followed by price pull-backs, resulting in a reluctance to deploy funds in the current market conditions.While the price of BTC has made some gains on Monday, Puell offered a word of caution that multiple factors should be considered, and no indicator should be used in isolation to make trading decisions.Puell said:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

358,"On June 25, the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) margin shorts at Bitfinex increased by 22,000, equivalent to $726 million. At the time, Cointelegraph reported that there was a significant increase in Bitfinex's spot volume market share starting at 9 am UTC, matching the demand in the short margin.Data confirms that one (or more) whales actively shorted the market, betting on a price decrease. The average price of the trade was around $33,000, so every $500 difference would result in an $11 million profit or loss when closing the short position.Related: Why Bitcoin's next breakout may not be an altcoin season signalIn the cryptocurrency world, traders tend to imagine that for some entity or group to build such a sizable position, there must be some 'inside' knowledge to protect them. However, as previously shown by Cointelegraph, the Bitfinex margin shorts from early June were underwater by $65 million when Bitcoin reached $40,400 on June 16.The important distinction between margin trading and futures (perpetual or quarterly) is that margin traders might use their own Bitcoin to close the trade. Thus, instead of buying it at the market, one needs only to inform the exchange that his spot holdings should be used to cover the short position.The same feature is not available at futures markets because the contracts are synthetic. Depositing 10 Bitcoin at the exchange does not ""free"" a short seller from having to actually buy back the $360,000 worth of contracts.Therefore, the short position could have been closed even if Bitfinex's spot volume doesn't completely account for the $900 million traded during that 8-hour period on June 25.Once again, the margin short close took place as the spot volume on Bitfinex increased on June 27. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the entities closing the margin trade did not previously buy Bitcoin to cover it.The average price as the 22,000 Bitcoin margin shorts was closed in the 20 hours starting on June 26 afternoon was $32,500. This data indicates a potential $11 million gross profit for the trade. However, it is worth noticing that on June 26, Bitcoin peaked at $32,700, causing those margin shorts to face a momentary $15.4 million loss.These traders could have closed their position as Bitcoin tested the $31,500 support, but the price showed resilience, and this might have erased most of the trade's gains. Regardless of what caused the short trades to be closed, it displays weakness from bears or a considerable discomfort in holding bear positions below $35,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

360,"Iran’s Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade issued operating licenses for 30 crypto mining centers in the country, the country's Financial Tribue reported last Wednesday.Citing data from the ministry’s website, the report says that Iran’s Semnan Province received the most licenses, with six crypto mining farms now authorized to operate in the region. Alborz Province secured four such licenses, followed by Mazandaran, East Azarbaijan and Zanjan Provinces. Tehran Province, which houses the country’s capital, reportedly received only one license to operate a crypto mining center.The ministry also issued 2,579 establishment permits for new industrial crypto mining units across the country, with 305 of them secured by Zanjan Province. Fars Province and West Azerbaijan follow Zanjan, with 262 and 247 permits, respectively.According to the report, an operating license is mandatory for Iranian companies to start a legal crypto mining business. Eligible applicants should acquire establishment permits and set up their industrial unit within 12 months, and then apply for the operating license.The report notes that cryptocurrency mining is legal in Iran, as miners are allowed to operate under rules approved by the government in July 2019. Despite the legal status of crypto mining in Iran, the government is actively fighting illegal crypto miners due to increasing pressure on the national power grid. According to the report, authorized crypto mining companies are required to pay much higher energy costs for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) than are residential or other commercial customers.The ministry did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.Related: Iran may reap upward of $1 billion in annual Bitcoin mining revenuesThe news comes after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced in late May a blanket ban on Bitcoin mining in the country until September as a measure to alleviate pressure on the national power grid. Subsequently, last Tuesday, Iranian provincial police confiscated more than 7,000 mining rigs at a farm operating in the capital of Tehran. The crypto mining farm was referred to as the largest, most significant drain on the country’s energy usage.According to the Iran Power Generation, Distribution and Transmission Company, more than 188,000 units of crypto mining equipment have been seized over the past 12 months. These devices reportedly resulted in 180 trillion rials ($4.2 billion) in losses to the national grid and power distribution equipment."
361,"Crypto exchange platform Huobi has updated its user agreement document, banning crypto derivatives trading for customers in China.According to the updated user agreement section of the Huobi Global website, the ban on crypto derivatives trading covers users in jurisdictions such as China, Taiwan, Israel and Iraq. Other banned countries include the United Kingdom — restricted to retail customers — as well as Bolivia, Bangladesh and Ecuador, to mention a few.The crypto derivatives trading ban is also in addition to longstanding prohibitions of the use of its platform in places such as Hong Kong, Japan, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Canada and the United States, among others. The platform warned that users who violate these restrictions risk losing their accounts.Huobi’s ban on crypto derivatives trading for Chinese users is likely due to renewed cryptocurrency crackdowns from authorities in Beijing. Earlier in June, the platform stopped new users in the country from trading crypto derivatives while also reducing the allowable leverage from 125x to less than 5x.Chinese authorities have upped the ante in recent weeks, even targeting the mining sector with close to 90% of Bitcoin (BTC) miners in the country forced to shut down.Some companies have begun to move overseas, with Bitcoin’s hash rate expected to see its largest difficulty drop with a significant portion of the network’s hash power offline, at least temporarily.Related: Crypto exchange Huobi has reportedly stopped letting new users trade derivativesHuobi’s ban also likely shrinks the options available to Chinese crypto derivatives traders. Platforms such as Binance and OKEx may likely be the next port of call for looking to trade highly leveraged cryptocurrency contracts.Binance, for its own part, has also been the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny.

BTCChina reportedly invested in ZG.com in January 2019.According to a report by the South China Morning Post, BTCChina said that it was exiting the Bitcoin business “in response to the Chinese government’s policy,” alluding to the major crackdown on crypto mining activity and related activities in the country.Founded back in 2011 by Huang Xiaoyu and Yang Linke, BTCChina was forced to stop trading cryptocurrencies in October 2017 following the Chinese government’s ban on crypto trading. The company then sold its exchange operations to a Hong Kong-based blockchain investment fund. The exchange continued to operate under the name BTCC, except for customers with a Chinese IP address. BTCC’s activities after the sale fueled speculation that it was affiliated with BTCChina and that Yang still controlled the exchange — claims which the company has denied.BTCC announced last week that the company was not affected by China’s crypto crackdown. “BTCC is not impacted for now because BTCC doesn’t provide trading of cryptocurrencies, but derivatives of cryptocurrencies,” the company said.Related: China’s crackdown means Bitcoin is working, says crypto minerZG.com and BTCC did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s requests for comment.The Chinese government has been cracking down on crypto in recent months, causing multiple closures of major crypto mining hubs in the country, including provinces like Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Qinghai.

363,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekend dance between $30,000 and $34,000 seems to strengthen the short-term uncertainty narrative, as JPMorgan strategists believe the cryptocurrency market is not yet healthy.A Friday note from the JPMorgan Chase team suggested that the near-term setup for Bitcoin still looks challenging. Based on the on-chain data, JPMorgan strategists said that “there is likely still an overhang of underwater positions which need to be cleared through the market.”JPMorgan lists the Bitcoin futures market’s stability and the possibility of increased production costs due to miners’ migration from China as positive factors. Bitcoin’s cost of production is historically tied to its price, several analyses show. So, a price bump in the cost of mining may have a booster effect on Bitcoin’s price.The note suggests that the cryptocurrency market appears to be at the beginning of a healing process but is not quite healthy yet. Fundstrat’s David Grider recommended reducing the risk or buying some protection, according to Bloomberg.Related: Bitcoin bounces off $30,000 amid the possibility of exit to mid-$40K rangeA bounce off $30,000, which is seen as a critical support level, came after the JPMorgan note.

364,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week with a key weekly close under its belt and everything to play for — can it hold higher?After the weekend saw moderate volatility, including a retest of $30,000 support, BTC/USD is back above $35,000.Despite the negative press, FUD and miner shake-up from China, the latest BTC price action shows that the largest cryptocurrency still has energy left to fight.Nonetheless, the risk of a further downturn remains, and by no means is everyone convinced that the market has truly bottomed.Cointelegraph considers five factors at play when determining where Bitcoin is headed next in the coming days.It’s stocks rather than the U.S. dollar leading the pack this week, as the S&P 500 sees its best week since February.On the back of easing concerns over the Federal Reserve boosting interest rates, equities rallied throughout last week. This contrasts with a cooling U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), which has halted gains in recent days after a rip roaring week last week.With the S&P 500 thus hitting a fresh all-time high, the risk of a change-up nonetheless cannot be discounted, commentators argue.“The risk of higher bond yields – and potentially a pull back in equities – due to ongoing strong U.S. economic data remains,” David Bassanese, chief economist at Australian funds provider BetaShares, wrote in a note quoted by Bloomberg.So far at least, long-term bond yields remain contained and equities more focused on the V-shaped rebound in economic growth and corporate earnings.U.S. dollar currency index 1-day candle chart. Source: TradingViewAmid a narrative of constantly higher highs in stocks despite the economic difficulties caused by coronavirus reactions, however, Bitcoin proponents have long been forecasting a day of reckoning.Chief among them is Robert Kiyosaki, author of the popular book, “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” who on Monday repeated his warnings over global markets.“The best time to prepare for a crash is before the crash. The biggest crash in world history is coming,” he told Twitter followers.The good news is the best time to get rich is during a crash. Bad news is the next crash will be a long one. Get more gold, silver, and Bitcoin while you can. Take care.For the Bitcoin spot price, Sunday ultimately gave bulls the happy ending they had been looking for.This specifically involves the weekly close, which as late as Saturday had been in danger of materializing below key levels needed to preserve the chances of further gains.In the event, BTC/USD beat expectations, rising by over $2,000 in hours overnight to see local highs of $35,250 on Bitstamp and a weekly close above $34,000.This puts the pair right on target and is “fantastic for bull-side momentum,” analyst Rekt Capital previously said before the data came in.BTC/USD chart with weekly close target.

Very, very nice in fact. pic.twitter.com/8Frmn4N7TUAnother popular social media trader called the overnight rise “significant” and focused on $35,000 resistance, along with Bitcoin’s rising relative strength index (RSI) to catch potential oversold (and overbought) levels.Further gains would also go some way to correcting the so-called “death cross” which occurred previously — where the 50-day moving average crosses the 200-day moving average in a move which has received considerable press attention.For those who cheered Bitcoin’s biggest difficulty increase since 2014 just six weeks ago, there’s bad news.As network fundamentals struggle in the wake of China’s mining shakeout, a difficulty adjustment this week will lay bare just how large an impact recent events have had.In four days’ time, difficulty will adjust down by an estimated 23.24% — something which has never happened before in Bitcoin’s lifetime.The record-breaking downward adjustment is a reaction to the mass offlining of Chinese miners, and for some — including those who are relocating overseas — it’s a gift.Estimated difficulty adjustment is currently sitting at -21% and targeting July 1.

This will be largest downward adjustment in Bitcoin’s history.

North American miners are about to EAT.Such adjustments keep Bitcoin mining competitive while preserving network security. Lower difficulty incentivizes more miners to join by making the process cheaper. This in turn raises competition, meaning that in general, larger downturns are followed by increases.“Mining hashrate could decline significantly, but difficulty would just adjust downward the network would clear blocks, and the remaining miners would become much more profitable, having to sell fewer coins, spurring the price upward, incentivizing more mining,” Saifedean Ammous, author of “The Bitcoin Standard,” summarized in a series of tweets about current events last week.Difficulty adjustment is the magic sauce that makes bitcoin work. It means that bitcoin mining grows & shrinks to the size it needs to survive & keep blocks clearing.Bitcoin difficulty 7-day average chart. Source: BlockchainAs Cointelegraph reported, hash rate — the amount of computing power dedicated to mining — has declined since the China debacle, but how much depends very much on the estimate used.According to MiningPoolStats, the preferred data of Blockstream CEO Adam Back, hash rate currently stands at around 83 exahashes per second (EH/s), down from a peak of 168 EH/s.A zoomed-out look at the state of Bitcoin adoption provides some welcome relief to the decidedly iffy spot market.As Cointelegraph reported, El Salvador has set off something of a domino effect with its law to make Bitcoin legal tender which enters into force in September.Paraguay is next in line to bring a legal motion before parliament, with details yet to be unveiled in full after a legal tender bill was submitted on June 24.Elsewhere, despite no formal changes to Bitcoin’s status, proponents appear emboldened by recent events.Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the third-richest man in Mexico according to Forbes’ rankings, reiterated Bitcoin as being the “new gold” this weekend, revealing his own contribution to local adoption.His banking business, Banco Azteca, is in the process of incorporating BTC, Salinas confirmed on Twitter.“Bitcoin is a good way to diversify your investment portfolio and I think that any investor should start studying cryptocurrencies and their future,” he wrote.At Banco Azteca we are working to bring them to our clients and continue to promote freedom.Even on the back of 5% daily gains, sentiment around Bitcoin is still firmly fear-driven.That’s according to the classic sentiment gauge, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which on Monday measured just 25/100 despite the price rises.A curated indicator of how cautious traders likely are, Fear & Greed dipped to rare lows in the past month, bottoming out at just 9/100.Crypto Fear & Greed Index.

366,"Despite India’s uncertain regulatory climate regarding crypto assets, nationwide investments in digital assets have increased by roughly 600% over the past year.According to data from blockchain analytics firm Chanalysis that was reported by Bloomberg on June 28, crypto investments increased during mid-2020 before going parabolic as the markets surged into new all-time highs towards the end of the fourth quarter.Chainalysis estimates the total invested in crypto across India grew from roughly $900 million to $6.6 billion over roughly the past year, with the firm estimating 15 million Indians are exposed to cryptocurrency.The data illustrates the positive impact of the Indian Supreme Court’s March 2020 decision to overturn the Reserve Bank of India’s ban on financial institutions providing banking services to firms operating with digital assets.However, it has not been entirely smooth sailing for India’s crypto sector since the Supreme Court repealed the RBI ban last March, with lawmakers frequently threatening new legislation prohibiting crypto assets over the past 15 months.In spite of the persistent threats of a renewed regulatory crackdown, Sandeep Goenka, the co-founder of local exchange ZebPay, highlighted growing appetites for digital assets among Indian’s aged 18 to 35, noting a preference to invest in crypto over gold.

367,"A court of appeals in Paris has upheld the five-year prison term in the case against BTC-e operator Alexander Vinnik.The court upheld a December 2020 verdict and prison sentence, finding that Vinnik/BTC-e had committed money laundering as part of an organized criminal group, and provided false information about the origin of the proceeds.The Parisian court dismissed several requests from Vinnik's defense team, including asking to examine copies of the evidence provided by the FBI. The court also exempted Vinnik from a fine of 100,000 Euros which originally accompanied the December sentence.Vinnik was originally charged with defrauding nearly 200 people using ransomware, but the court cleared him of the malware attack charges in December. The prosecution service had asked for a smaller fine, expressing doubts that he would be able to pay out the victims of his crimes, according to Russian state news outlet TAAS.The defense team plans to file a cassation appeal within five days as required by French law.The Russian computer specialist was originally detained while vacationing in Greece during July 2017 at the request of the United States. He is accused by the U.S. of laundering more than $4 billion while operating the now-defunct crypto exchange BTC-e.In January 2020, Vinnik was extradited to France, where he was sentenced to five years in prison in December. Vinnik’s lawyer, Frédéric Bélot, fears that Greek authorities may want him returned to Greece after the sentence to face extradition to the United States on similar charges.Russia has also filed an extradition request citing humanitarian grounds. After Vinnik went on hunger strike in Greece in November 2018, Russian human rights ombudswoman, Tatiana Moskalkova, sought the assistance of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to vouch for Vinnik to be returned to Russia. At the time, she emphasized the deteriorating health of both Vinnik and his wife, who had been diagnosed with brain cancer.Related: BTC-e’s Vinnik Case Drags on as New Accusations Continue EmergingHowever, it has been reported that Russia’s extradition request may be motivated by preventing sensitive data regarding its intelligence operations from falling into the hands of foreign adversaries, with some analysts suggesting Russian intelligence agencies may have used BTC-e to acquire Bitcoin for classified operations.If extradited, Vinnik would face the lighter charges of “fraud in the field of computer information” in Russia."
368,"Trading should just be a simple process of buying low and selling high but for many investors the process is more akin to rocket science. One of the most basic and easy-to-understand strategies that can help accomplish this is to identify an asset’s support and resistance levels.Once traders can spot the support and resistance levels, they can improve their entry and exit timing in the market. Support and resistances are also helpful during bullish, bearish and range-bound markets.Let’s take a moment to understand the basics.Support is formed at a level where the demand from the buyers absorbs the supply from sellers, preventing the price from declining further. At this level, the bullish traders are inclined to buy as they believe the price is attractive enough and may not decline further.On the other hand, the bears stop selling because they believe the market has fallen enough and may be due for a rebound. When both these situations occur, a support is formed.The above chart is a good example of a strong support. Every time EOS price drops to the $2.33 level, buyers emerge and the selling reduces. This causes demand to exceed supply, resulting in a rebound.Although horizontal supports are considered to be more reliable, they are not the only way supports are formed. During uptrends, trendlines act as supports.Litecoin (LTC) started its bull run in December of 2020. Thereafter, the price rebounded off the trendline on several occasions. This happened because when the price neared the trendline, the bulls purchased, believing that the LTC/USDT pair had reached attractive levels to buy.At the same time, the counter-trend traders stopped selling, assuming that the near-term may be oversold. Both these occurring at the same time caused the correction to end and the uptrend to resume.Resistance can be considered as the opposite of support because it is the level where supply exceeds demand, halting the up-move.The resistance is formed when buyers who have purchased at lower levels start to book profits and the aggressive bears start shorting as they believe the rally is extended and ready for a pullback. When supply exceeds demand, the rally stalls and reverses.The support or resistance does not need to be a single level. The above chart shows how the area between $10,500 to $11,000 acted as the resistance zone. Whenever the price reached this zone, short-term traders booked profits and aggressive bears shorted the BTC/USDT pair. Between August 2019 and July 2020, the pair turned down from the resistance zone on five occasions.Similar to support, the resistance line or zone does not need to always be horizontal.During the decline from May 6, 2018, to July 4, 2018, Ether (ETH) rallied to the resistance line, also called the downtrend line, but turned down from there. This is because traders who had a bearish outlook used the rallies to initiate fresh short positions as they anticipated lower levels.At the same time, aggressive bulls who purchased on sharp dips closed their positions near the resistance line. Hence, the line acted as a wall and the price turned down from it.When the support and resistance are clearly defined as in the EOS/USD pair above, traders can buy on a rebound off the support and wait for the price to rally near the resistance to close the position. The stop-loss for the trade can be kept just below the support of the range.Several times, professional traders may try to hunt these stops by pulling the price below the support of the range. Therefore, traders may buy on the way up and also wait for the price to close decisively below the support before dumping their positions.When an asset takes support on an uptrend line three times, traders may expect the line to hold. Hence, long positions can be taken on a bounce off the uptrend line. The stops for the trade can be kept just below the trendline.However, in an uptrend, the break below the trendline does not necessarily mean that the trend has reversed. Many times, the trend just takes a break before resuming again.As seen in the chart above, the ETH/USDT pair took support on the uptrend line on several occasions. However, when the pair broke below the uptrend line, it did not start a new downtrend. The price consolidated in a range for a few days before resuming the up-move.Traders may close their long positions if the price dips and sustains below the uptrend line but new short positions should be avoided. If the price resumes its uptrend after consolidation, traders may again look for buying opportunities.When the price breaks out of a resistance, the bulls try to flip the previous resistance into support. If that happens, a new uptrend begins or resumes. If this happens several times, it may offer a good buying opportunity.Bitcoin was stuck between the $10,500 to $11,000 zone from August 2019 to July 2020. After the breakout from the resistance zone, the price again dropped below $10,500, but the bulls bought the dip aggressively, flipping the level into support. This offered a good buying opportunity to traders as the new uptrend was just getting started.Polkadot’s (DOT) chart above shows how the zone between $28.90 to $26.50 was acting as a support zone from Feb. 14 to May 18 of this year. However, once the bears pulled the price below the support zone, the zone flipped over into resistance and has not allowed the price to break above it since then. This is an instance where a support zone turned into a resistance.While analyzing any coin, traders must look for support and resistance levels as they can act as good entry and exit opportunities.In an uptrend, traders should look to buy at support levels and in a downtrend, traders should look to short at the resistance line.Support and resistance levels are not set in stone and professional traders will try to hunt for stop orders.

369,"The U.S. core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 0.5% in May, below market estimates of 0.6%. However, when compared year-over-year, the PCE index surged to 3.4% recording its largest gain since 1991.While the U.S. Federal Reserve expects inflation to be transitory, analysts at BofA differ in their estimation. The bank anticipates U.S. inflation to remain high, in the 2% to 4% range, for the next two to four years and believes the Fed will hike rates in the next six months, barring a financial market crash.If inflation remains elevated, investors are again likely to focus on Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge their portfolios. A CoinShares report published on June 21 said it was unsure of inflation in the next five years but believed ""adding Bitcoin and other real assets as a prudent measure to protect portfolios from the tail-risk of out-of-control inflation.""Although near-term risk remains, select cryptocurrencies could offer short-term trading opportunities to traders. During a bear phase, traders may focus on booking profits at regular intervals instead of waiting for windfall rallies. Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may turn short-term bullish in the next few days.Bitcoin dropped to the $28,000 to $31,000 support zone on June 26 but the positive sign is that the bulls again bought this dip. This suggests that buyers are accumulating at lower levels.The bulls will now try to push the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($35,148). If they manage to do that, it will suggest that the selling pressure may be reducing. The positive divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) is also pointing to a possible relief rally.A break above the 20-day EMA could open the doors for a move to the stiff overhead resistance zone at $40,000 to $42,451.67. The 200-day simple moving average ($43,505) is just above this zone, hence the bulls may find it difficult to climb above it.This points to a possible consolidation between $28,000 and $42,451.67 for the next few days. The longer the price trades in this range, the stronger will be the next breakout from it. The trend will favor the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below $28,000.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are attempting to form a higher bottom at $30,000. The 20-EMA has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting that the sellers are losing their grip.If the bulls sustain the price above the 20-EMA, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the 200-SMA. A breakout of this resistance could attract further buying that may push the price to $40,527. This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $30,000.Cardano (ADA) rebounded off the $1 support on June 22, indicating strong accumulation near this level. However, the bulls could not push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.39) on June 24 and 25, suggesting that bears are defending the resistance.The gradually downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears have the upper hand. The ADA/USDT pair may witness a long liquidation if the bears sink and sustain the price below $1. That could pull the price down to $0.68 and then to $0.40.Conversely, if the bulls can thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the short-term trend has tilted in favor of the bulls. The pair could then rise to $1.60 and then to the stiff overhead resistance at $1.94.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have flattened out and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. If the bulls push the price above $1.40, it will indicate the possibility of a short-term bottom formation. The pair could then attempt to rally to $1.60 and then to $1.88.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or $1.40 and plummets below $1.20, it will suggest a lack of buyers at higher levels. The pair may then drop to the critical support at $1.The long tail on Solana’s (SOL) June 22 candlestick shows that traders are aggressively defending the 200-day SMA ($20). However, the relief rally could not scale above the 20-day EMA ($33), indicating that bears are selling on rallies.The buyers are currently attempting to form a higher low at $26.65. If they can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the SOL/USDT pair could pick up momentum and move up to the downtrend line and then to $44.However, the downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that bears will have other plans. They will try to defend the 20-day EMA and sink the price below $26.65. If this support cracks, the pair may drop to $21.10.A strong rebound off this support will suggest that bulls are accumulating on dips. The pair could then consolidate between $21.10 and $44 for the next few days.The 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between buyers and sellers. This balance may tilt in favor of the bulls if they push and sustain the price above $33.Such a move could clear the path for a move to the downtrend line and then to $42. On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level or $33, The bears will try to break the support at $26.65. If that happens, the advantage may tilt in favor of the bears.Polygon (MATIC) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($1.29) for the past few days but the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip to the May 23 low at $0.74. This suggests a lack of sellers at current levels.If the bulls regroup and push the price above the downtrend line, it will indicate that the correction may be over. The MATIC/USDT pair could then rise to $1.71 and later to the psychological resistance at $2.However, the bears may have other plans. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that sellers have the upper hand. If they sink the price below $0.92, the pair may drop to the $0.74 to $0.68 support zone.The bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively. A strong bounce will suggest accumulation at lower levels and the bulls may then try to push the price above the downtrend line.The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the downtrend line. The downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the negative zone indicate advantage to the bears. If they sink the price below $1, the pair may drop to $0.92.Conversely, if the price rebounds off $1, the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, it will suggest that bulls are trying to make a comeback. The pair may pick up momentum on a breakout and close above $1.25.Related: 'Absolutely right' to think of Bitcoin as the new gold — Mexico's 3rd richest manKlaytn (KLAY) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($1.02) for the past many days but the RSI is showing a positive divergence. This indicates that the sellers may be losing their grip.If the bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, it will be an indication that a trend change is possible. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the recovery in the $1.24 to $1.29 zone.If the price turns down from the overhead zone but does not dip below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bulls are trying to make a comeback. A breakout of the resistance zone could attract buyers who may then challenge the 200-day SMA ($1.51).A breakout and close above the 200-day SMA will indicate that the downtrend may be over in the short term. This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $0.72.The 4-hour chart shows the KLAY/USDT pair is trading inside a descending channel. The bulls had pushed the price above the channel and the 200-SMA but they could not sustain the higher levels.If the bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-EMA, the pair may again try to rise above the channel and the 200-SMA. If that happens, the pair may start a new uptrend that could reach $1.62.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair breaks below $0.86, the decline could extend to $0.72.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

370,"Institutional exposure to cryptocurrencies via derivatives continued to grow in the second quarter, as CME Group’s newly launched Bitcoin (BTC) micro contract received considerable uptick in its first two months of trading. Since launching on May 3, CME’s Micro Bitcoin futures contract has already surpassed 1 million contracts traded, the Chicago-based derivatives market announced earlier this week. CME executive Tim McCourt said the new product has been popular among institutions and day traders seeking to hedge their spot Bitcoin price risk. Denominated at 0.1 BTC, the micro contract is one-tenth the size of one Bitcoin. By comparison, CME’s main Bitcoin futures contract unit is 5 BTC.""We've seen more institutional volume than we anticipated, which shows that the timing was right for a smaller bitcoin contract,” said Brooks Dudley, the global head of digital assets at ED&F Man Capital Markets.Related: ‘Bitcoin will go all the way to $160,000 this year,’ says Celsius CEOInstitutions have reduced their long-term exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during the latest correction, with outflows totaling $79 million last week, according to CoinShares data. In the case of BTC, newly liquidated coins are being scooped up by long-term holders who remain convinced in the long-term prospects of their investment.More activity in the derivatives market suggests traders are hedging their positions, speculating on the short-term directional movement of Bitcoin or both. Although derivatives trading has increased institutional exposure to Bitcoin, it has also become a source of stress for spot holders. As Cointelegraph reported, Friday’s $6 billion in Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) expiries created considerable friction in the market, with some traders expecting extreme volatility.High volatility was reported in the latter half of the week, with the BTC price falling 13.6% peak-to-trough between June 24-26.

371,"Bitcoin (BTC) is definitively the ""new gold"" for the third richest man in Mexico, Ricardo Salinas Pliego.In a tweet on June 27, Ricardo Salinas Pliego confirmed claims that he recommends Bitcoin as an investment rather than fiat currencies or gold. Pliego, already well known as a Bitcoin proponent, has stuck by his conviction, furthering South America's newfound penchant for the largest cryptocurrency.""That’s totally right, Bitcoin is the new gold, but too much more portable, transport Bitcoin is so much easier than having your in pockets gold bars … and i know that I’m going to be attacked by gold lovers,"" he responded to a tweet by MicroStrategy CEO, Michael Saylor.Saylor had linked to a previous video interview with Pliego in which he argued that Bitcoin easily beats the U.S. dollar when it comes to wealth preservation.Pliego has professed his admiration for Bitcoin on multiple occasions and various platforms, including in a dedicated interview with Cointelegraph at the start of the year.When asked by a Twitter user how Mexico could follow El Salvador in making it legal tender, Pliego nonetheless drew a blank.""No idea,"" he replied.As Cointelegraph reported, El Salvador's new era of legal tender BTC comes into force in September, while Paraguay is also making noises about increased use.Meanwhile, the debate regarding Bitcoin versus gold remains alive and kicking.Related: Bitcoin in uptrend but BTC may never beat gold's $10T market cap — ex-NYSE headPeter Schiff, arguably the most vocal gold bug on Twitter, continues to denounce Bitcoin as vastly inferior to the precious metal. ""Most of the Bitcoin buyers who bought the last dip below $30K will not buy the next,"" he claimed in one of two tweets on Friday.A dip to $20,000 or even lower has been acknowledged as a possibility by analysts themselves. This weekend, however, BTC/USD preserved $30,000 support after a fresh retest."
372,"China’s crackdown on Bitcoin (BTC) mining operations has led to a significant drop in the network’s hash rate, but industry participants believe it presents an incredible opportunity for the wider mining ecosystem.China has long been a major contributor to the Bitcoin mining space, at times accounting for more than 70% of the global hash rate of the world’s preeminent cryptocurrency. That was up until June 2021, when the Chinese government moved to shutter a number of the world’s biggest mining centers.The Chinese southwestern province of Sichuan has an abundance of hydroelectric power, which is fed by Asia’s largest river, Yangtze. The advent of ASIC mining saw the province become home to some of the biggest mining operations in the world over the past few years due to its favorable electricity rates. But that is now coming to an abrupt end, driven by the country’s hardening stance on cryptocurrency mining and the ecosystem in general.Local media has reported that 26 major Bitcoin mining hubs were forced to shutter in Sichuan, which has had a dramatic effect on the global hash rate. The Bitcoin hash rate peaked mid-May at 171 terahashes per second (TH/s) but has dropped to a low of 83 TH/s on June 23 — marking a 50% drop in just over a month.Industry analysts estimate that more than 70% of the total mining capacity in China has gone offline over the past week, and that could increase to more than 90% in the coming weeks.Kevin Zhang, vice president of Foundry Services — a mining infrastructure company — provided an overview of the situation in China in a Twitter thread. The key takeaways were that operators were given minimal time to pack up shop, while much of their electrical infrastructure is not compatible with systems in other countries.Bitmain, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of ASIC mining hardware, has temporarily postponed sales of new mining equipment in an effort to support miners who are looking to sell second-hand hardware.At a glance, the situation looks troubling, but some believe that the resilience of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem will prevail. The regulatory clampdown in China presents a unique opportunity for miners in other countries to accumulate BTC holdings.Daniel Frumkin, mining researcher at Braiins and Slush Pool, unpacked the initial impact of this latest drop in hash rate in his correspondence with Cointelegraph:The researcher also highlighted the fact that the security of the Bitcoin network has not been affected despite the scale of the hashing power that was taken offline in recent weeks, adding: “Chinese miners are relocating machines all over the world, so the geographic distribution of hash rate will likely be far better in 6–12 months than at any prior time period in the ASIC era.”Nevertheless, the effects of the Chinese mining squeeze was felt across the cryptocurrency markets as Annabelle Huang, head of GlobalX at Amber Group, highlighted a recent sell-off and slump in various cryptocurrency prices:There have been some interesting knock-on effects as Chinese-based miners go offline. First and foremost, these miners are now looking for new locales to reestablish their operations, while some have taken to selling their equipment.Frumkin noted that the market for ASIC hardware would become saturated with a large amount of used hardware for sale, while third-party hosting service providers may very well find their excess space quickly filled up by miners looking to take ASICs online: “Existing mining facilities that offer hosting to third parties are filling up fast, and new mining infrastructure takes a lot of time to plan and build.” He added further, “Any companies and countries who are able to quickly build infrastructure to host thousands of ASICs can be the biggest winners from this situation.”The advent of ASIC mining heavily disrupted the efficacy of small-scale, enthusiast Bitcoin miners that simply could not compete with the scale of economies of industrial-sized mining operations. For the first time in many years, smaller mining operators may have a chance to expand their operations, but some barriers still remaining as Frumkin explained further:The reality of this latest regulatory move in China is that the landscape and distribution of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem are changing dramatically and rapidly. Some Chinese firms have been proactively looking for new locations to set up mining centers over the past two years as rumblings of a wider crackdown bubbled under the surface.The likes of Canaan, which branched out from hardware manufacturing to actual mining, have established a base of operation in Kazakhstan, making use of its own proprietary Avalon mining units. BTC.com, the world’s fifth-largest mining pool, has also relocated its first batch of miners to the country as well.A move to neighboring Asian countries will no doubt be the easiest exportation option for Chinese miners, but space and power will come at a premium, and options further afield are being explored already.As Foundry’s Chang summed up on Twitter, the so-called “great ASIC exodus” certainly won’t be as seamless, as firms grapple with logistical considerations, hosting terms and negotiations. Frumkin believes this has tipped the scales in favor of hosting companies: “This is a huge opportunity for mining infrastructure companies to capitalize on increasing demand for hosting capacity.”Related: Death knell for Chinese crypto miners? Rigs on the move after gov’t crackdownIndeed, it may be that the death knell has tolled for mining in China, and the great migration of mining equipment has begun. Frumkin believes that all these factors point to North America becoming the next hub of Bitcoin mining in the years to come. He claims that the close proximity to hardware suppliers have Chinese miners at an advantage, adding, “Meanwhile, many larger miners in North America have found sub-four and even sub-three cents per kWh electricity, which is on par or better than the prices Chinese miners have been paying in recent years.” He concluded:As Darin Feinstein, founder of Core Scientific, aptly summed up on Twitter, the resilience of the Bitcoin mining network was evident in the fact that, despite a huge portion of the network’s hash rate being forced offline, firms quickly looked to relocate in an uncoordinated fashion while the end-user was largely unaffected.As he stated: “China forced a shutdown of 60%+ of the Bitcoin network infrastructure. There were no lawsuits, no bankruptcies, no bailouts, no downtime. Network infrastructure just shrugged and relocated to countries with increased freedoms.”"
373,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose from a fresh $30,000 support challenge on June 27, continuing uncertain ranging which has worried traders.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting highs of $33,445 on Bitstamp Sunday.Saturday saw the pair drop back to $30,070, ultimately averting another dip below significant psychological support after last week's volatility.This was not enough to buoy sentiment among traders, however, as many already believed the local BTC price bottom was not yet in.Can't we just all agree to dump #BTC and nuke it to $26k over the weekend to start on monday the next bull run with a V-shape recovery ?For analyst Rekt Capital, the prospect of Bitcoin losing its 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $33,500, was cause for concern for bulls.""The BTC recovery is promising but the 50 WEMA hasn't yet been reclaimed as support,"" he told Twitter followers after Sunday's move higher.At the time of writing, BTC/USD traded at around $32,400, leaving a fair amount of ground to cover to clinch a more optimistic start to the coming week.Rekt Capital added that using Wyckoff analysis, Bitcoin could still bounce by $10,000 to end in the mid-$40,000 range if a current wedge holds without a breakdown.As ever, longer-term outlooks from seasoned market participants showed a different world from the fraught intraday price activity. Related: ‘Bitcoin will go all the way to $160,000 this year,’ says Celsius CEOAmong the sources of feel-good analysis at the weekend was PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow price models.""Bitcoin: short term volatile, long term trending up,"" he summarized alongside a comparative chart of Bitcoin's 200-week moving average (WMA) and realized cap.As Cointelegraph reported, the 200 WMA is a principal ""line in the sand"" that spot price has never crossed.

374,"“If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it” is probably the most cited quote attributed to Peter Drucker, who is known as the father of management thinking. While the quote is apocryphal, nevertheless it gained its place in the pantheon of business books because it highlights the importance of reliable metrics in making sound business decisions. In the crypto space, we are still missing one of the most important metrics: an official daily reference exchange rate.A reference rate is vital in allowing accountants to assign a particular exchange value between two or more currencies on any given date, even though those currencies may have fluctuated outside the specific time. The reference rate is a shared benchmark for companies, investors, auditors and regulators.It’s not by chance that more than 10 years after the first Bitcoin (BTC) was mined, we still lack this crucial metric in the ecosystem. In the fiat economy, central banks are in charge of fixing a reference exchange rate, based on a regular daily basis concertation procedure. But in crypto, we don’t have a notion of a central bank — we outright reject the concept of a centralized monetary authority. The outcome, though, is a fragmented landscape of unofficial rates with different exchanges and aggregators having different prices that can lead to confusion and, in some cases, fraud.Related: Professional traders need a global crypto sea, not hundreds of lakesYou may wonder: Why is this so important, anyway? Perhaps the decentralized economy doesn’t need an official daily reference rate. Maybe this was true a few years ago, but not anymore. The crypto markets are inexorably growing in size, market capitalization and adoption. Studies suggest we have reached over 100 million crypto owners around the globe — roughly the size of the population of Egypt. There are around 43 million active crypto traders and up to 500,000 unique daily users sending or receiving cryptocurrencies.We knew the recent crypto rally would spur a new surge of interest in crypto assets, especially with its equally predictable hype. But we also know that with every wave of “blockchain tourism,” the industry gets bigger. This time, the market and players have behaved differently from the last crypto frenzy in 2017. More and more institutional investors are onboarding, making the market more sophisticated and complex, and definitely more mature.Related: The remaining steps to mainstream institutional investmentThose of us who have been around long enough in the crypto space also know that behind the markets’ ups and downs are a legion of brilliant people building amazing projects in the blockchain and crypto sphere. At this stage, the decentralized ecosystem has many companies working in a wide range of specialties all over different jurisdictions. However, this implies that you need to account for the value of those transactions. You need to plan budgets, value assets, pay taxes and settle operations involving several currencies — crypto and fiat — at different times and even during different days of the week, to account for the time zones.The crypto “Wild West” is over, and that means asset values can no longer be up for interpretation. We need an official reference rate, and without it, accountants can’t accurately value crypto held on balance sheets. This leaves the door open for fraud and slows the progress of crypto as a mainstream asset on corporate books. Audit and compliance concerns were among the six biggest barriers to blockchain adoption, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ (PwC) “2018 Global Blockchain Survey.”A reference rate would bring benefits to key players in decentralized finance. For accountants, it would be a shared, standard way to value crypto assets, giving them stronger fraud protections. For investors, it would provide a true apples-to-apples comparison when evaluating investment opportunities. For auditors, it would provide a tool to independently verify that a company is properly valuing its assets — and not committing fraud.From an accounting perspective, the current system is a nightmare. A handful of players have set themselves up as the authorities fixing the rates. There is a lack of a proper set of rules and details on where the information came from and at what point in time. This leads to considerable price spreads among the different, unofficial exchange rate sources.For those of us who have devoted ourselves to building decentralized accounting protocols, it is natural that we are looking into decentralized solutions. Now, as Chainlink decentralized price feeds become de-facto standards, it’s time to keep innovating and develop an official reference rate for all crypto assets that is transparent, independent and methodologically sound. A widely shared daily exchange rate that investors, businesses and auditors can rely on to value any crypto assets and foreign exchange transactions at the end of any given period.The current consensus is to “hold” your crypto on the balance sheet as a hedge against inflation. But we need to prepare for a future where brick-and-mortar businesses begin to experiment with billing in their favorite cryptocurrencies for goods and services, drawing up contracts with crypto values, paying suppliers and employees and settling their taxes with crypto. That is the future that we are working for, and that’s why crypto needs a decentralized daily reference rate.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

375,"One of the most common errors traders make when analyzing cryptocurrency markets is taking an exchanges' bid and ask data and traded volumes at face value. When doing this type of analysis, the trader has to exclude the trading venues mentioned on multiple 'fake trading volumes' reports, like the one Bitwise published in March 2019.There's really no way to know if the top exchanges inflate their volumes by granting special access and zero fees for market makers.Even the exchanges themselves have no way to know if a group of users are related or conducting multiple transactions among themselves to inflate prices or volumes. There are hundreds, if not thousands of influencers, pump and dump chat rooms, trading apps, and the like.Therefore, not every wash trade or transaction between related entities has been brainstormed by the exchange or the crypto projects with a foundation or marketing team.As Philip Gradwell, chief economist of Chainalysis, explained:Investors usually speculate that these unethical practices happen only at exchanges located on remote islands. However, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined Coinbase after an employee ""self-traded"" to create the illusion of volume and demand for Litecoin (LTC) before Sept. 2018.In case you're wondering, decentralized exchanges (DEX) have also been used for 'wash trading' activity as there are barely any impediments, apart from network gas fees.Take notice how the 22,000 Bitcoin margin short increase at Bitfinex initiated as the price dropped below $34,000 and remained at a steady pace while Bitcoin continued to plunge.The hourly price candles at Coinbase show a descending pattern that perfectly matches Bitfinex's margin short activity. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin's $2.5 billion monthly options expiry took place at 8 am UTC, roughly one hour before the price action highlighted above.Furthermore, the CME futures expiry occurred at 3 pm UTC, potentially involving 12.6k Bitcoin contracts worth $412 million. However, there is no reason to believe that derivatives expiries directly relate to the Bitfinex margin short increase.One must analyze spot exchanges' volumes to understand whether Bitfinex played a significant role in the Bitcoin price correction initiated in the early hours of June 25.Hourly volume candles from the past four days clearly show a significant hike in Bitfinex's market share starting at 9 am UTC on June 25. The movement lasted for seven hours but mostly dissipated shortly afterward.Traders might as well have been spooked by a similar move earlier this month, when Bitfinex margin shorts increased to 25,000 BTC, right before the price initiated a one-week plunge down to a $28,800 low on June 22.Such events may or may not result in a profitable trade for bears, usually making a heavy impression on traders. After all, not everyone has the margin required to short 22,000 Bitcoin, worth $726 million.In short, there is a clear indication that the market downturn had little relation to derivatives expiry, as the Bitfinex spot volumes spike coincided with the margin shorts increase. However, once the pressure disappeared, Bitcoin could recover the $32,000 support, which might be enough to motivate buyers.Weekends usually display lower volumes so it will be interesting to see how cautious investors are in the face of this mammoth short seller.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

376,"Although the price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hover around $30,000, industry experts are noting that there is a bullish long-term view. To put this into perspective, Alex Mashinsky, chief executive officer and co-founder of Celsius – the centralized cryptocurrency lending platform – told Cointelegraph at Bitcoin 2021 in Miami that he sees Bitcoin reaching $160,000 this year, or possibly a bit lower. “We haven’t seen the highs yet for 2021,” Mashinsky said.Mashinsky further remarked that the crypto market was bound for a correction, following Bitcoin’s recent all-time high of over $63,000:In addition to discussing the price of Bitcoin, Mashinsky commented on Elon Musk’s recent tweets about Bitcoin. According to Mashinsky, Musk is not helping the crypto community, but rather manipulating the market. As such, he noted that Musk is simply a “tourist” in the land of crypto.Mashinsky also noted that Tesla accepting Bitcoin payments will benefit Musk, but not consumers:Roni Cohen Pavon, chief revenue officer at Celsius, further told Cointelegraph that Celsius will be moving its business operations from the United Kingdom to the United States in the coming months.According to Cohen Pavon, the shift to the U.S. was promoted by the recent regulatory uncertainty in the U.K. for crypto companies. “We came to the conclusion that the U.K. is not the most stable place for Celsius in terms of regulations and geopolitical perspectives,” he said.Although Celsius has had a physical office in the U.S. since 2019, Cohen Pavon explained that Celsius will now become a limited liability company, or LLC. “Nothing changes with our services – we are now an LLC instead of Celsius Network Limited. I believe the transition to engage as a U.S. entity will be completed by early or mid August.”Watch the whole interview here!"
377,"Digital currencies are quickly becoming more mainstream within the Canadian financial landscape. Alongside this increased adoption, Canada has been relatively successful at creating a stable regulatory environment. In 2014, Canada established itself as a leader in the global digital asset space when the Canadian Parliament became the first government in the world to pass a national law on digital currencies. Since then, Canadian regulators have remained fairly proactive in their approach toward cryptocurrency, taking a cautious-yet-optimistic stance in an attempt to promote innovation while still protecting investor interests. Especially in comparison to other international jurisdictions, which either impose stricter policies or harbor a more laissez-faire attitude, Canada’s supportive environment to cryptocurrency is reflected in some of the options offered to startups experimenting with digital asset technology.For example, the Canadian Security Association’s (CSA) sandbox initiative supports financial technology (fintech) businesses seeking to offer innovative products by carefully vetting business models in live-testing environments. Similarly, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) LaunchPad works with financial service businesses to keep regulation aligned with digital innovation and encourage the development of products, services and applications that meet compliance standards required by securities laws.In addition to these services aimed at innovators looking to collaborate directly with financial authorities in the context of their specific business model, regulators have also published broad, but comprehensive, guidance on navigating applicable legislative frameworks.Related: Will regulation adapt to crypto, or crypto to regulation? Experts answerThe need for regulation has polarized the crypto industry ever since its inception. Investors and enterprises are hungry for processes, for which having a regulatory framework is a must. On the other hand, an over-regulated economy might isolate Canadians from integrating with the broader digital asset industry, forcing investments overseas. So, what is a good balance between the two?Early advocates of blockchain presumed that its distinctive qualities of disintermediation make it insusceptible to regulation and argued that cryptocurrency had been created as a solution to the stringent public oversight of financial markets. Under this assumption, many token issuers before mid-2017 largely ignored securities law registration requirements meant to protect investors and foster fair markets.However, reliable legal remedies are necessary for the protection of individual rights and are integral for a functionally accountable jurisdiction. Especially within the financial sector, where individuals are extremely vulnerable to risk, regulation minimizes consumer exposure to harm and is paramount for maintaining market integrity.For example, it is now well established that Canadian businesses dealing with cryptocurrency (such as crypto exchanges) must register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) as a money services business (MSB). Registration means that these enterprises are subject to regulatory oversight and reporting requirements. As a result of these legislative obligations, fraudulent actors are more likely to be squeezed out of the space to make room for lawful players who can provide higher levels of investor protection. This legitimization of the digital asset industry is primarily why trading platforms are welcoming progressive regulation; working constructively between one another to increase security and transparency without stifling an industry that is still in its infancy.Related: QuadrigaCX users lose $190M as speculations over Cotten’s death swirlTherefore, policymakers play an essential role in developing the necessary conditions to create a suitable framework for cryptocurrencies to operate safely. The CSA jurisdiction, along with the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), has expressed its interest in working closely with digital asset trading companies to understand their point of view, factor in key risks to innovation and ensure that investor protection is not compromised.Regulations of this magnitude cannot be rushed, and several factors have been taken into account by regulators to ensure that any new legislation only encourages the digital asset industry to boom. Allowing Canada to operate as a successful crypto venue while safeguarding investment security and fraud prevention are some of the key elements of the proposed regulatory framework. The sweet spot for regulation is somewhere in between — stringent enough to protect investments and fraud, and permissible enough to allow private and international digital asset companies to thrive.Related: How smart regulation can improve the future of blockchainWhen it comes to the integration of crypto into traditional investing, Canada has been remarkably advanced with its sanctioning of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds in 2021, allowing more mainstream investors the opportunity to have digital asset exposure through their investment accounts, including tax-advantaged registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs) and tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs).Canada also surpassed the United States by allowing digital asset exchange-traded funds (ETFs), setting a precedent of wanting to be competitive in the sector. In February, Purpose Financial LP’s Bitcoin ETF accumulated over $400 million assets under management within its first two days and went on to cross the $1 billion mark within two months post-launch.With a growing portfolio of investments, one would assume that tax-related concerns could potentially arise. However, Canadian tax authorities have been fairly clear in matters of tax implications and have provided adequate guidance to investors along the way. Currently, Canada’s tax laws and rules, including the Income Tax Act, also apply to cryptocurrency transactions.The Canada Revenue Agency has characterized cryptocurrency as a commodity and stated that the use of cryptocurrency to pay for goods or services should be treated as a barter transaction. Because cryptocurrency is treated as a commodity, it has prevented the unfavorable misreporting of taxes as a result. However, the landscape is constantly evolving, so regulators must remain ahead of the game to avoid crypto enthusiasts looking at the United States, Europe or Asia as alternative playgrounds, draining Canada of both its talent and its investment.Related: Stablecoins present new dilemmas for regulators as mass adoption loomsCanada is a crypto miner’s top choice, owing to its climate, electric supply and light regulation. Hardware used by cryptocurrency miners generates a significant amount of heat and requires cooling to prevent overheating, and being located in a relatively cool climate like Canada helps to reduce the costs of cooling the computers. Furthermore, power rates in Quebec are among the lowest in North America. For industrial consumers, rates are around $0.05 per kilowatt-hour. Energy consumption is the main cost of cryptocurrency miners, and understandably the top reason they’re drawn to Canada.Finally, there is potential for Canadian digital asset companies to not just offer trading but also own and operate crypto mining facilities. Canada offers a safe haven for miners coming from politically and financially unstable environments to carry out operations within a relaxed framework, putting the country at the forefront of the digital currency revolution. Miners from previously heavy crypto quarries like China are on the lookout for favorable pastures with less hostile regulations and are now looking at Canada as a lucrative alternative.Thinking long term, there is also the sentiment of sustainability, and while traditional finance industries lean on carbon-based energy sources, digital assets are comfortably moving in the direction of greener energy. This is further confirmed by Square’s report on the Bitcoin Clean Energy Initiative — a unique energy model that could enable the installation and capacity of more sustainable methods of solar and wind generation. Canada is a global leader in sourcing renewable energy, and a flexible regulatory framework around cryptocurrency could mean an influx of international players heading to “The True North.”Related: Ignore the headlines — Bitcoin mining is already greener than you thinkWith the digital asset space being internet-native, fintech platforms can be built anywhere in the world. This globalization of the financial industry means that Canada cannot simply wait for a regulatory framework to become available, or it will lag behind in the innovation race. The onus is on regulators to incentivize digital asset investment and project development in their country.Familiarizing the Canadian market with digital asset trading with the introduction of more crypto-asset trading platforms is a solid first step. The next decade will see a lot more regulation introduced into the sector. Governments that are smart and forward-thinking will see an obvious opportunity to offer clear but not overly restrictive regulation, and become a welcoming place for digital asset projects.Historically, authoritarian governments — where hostile and unstable rule-making induces a net negative to their economy — are more likely to impose stricter measures on digital assets, which could inevitably force industry participants to move to countries like Canada that offer relatively favorable conditions. Digital asset companies will continue to move to wherever they are most welcome, and the countries that facilitate these moves will be much better positioned to reap the benefits of the digital asset industry as it continues to grow and threaten traditional finance.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

378,"In a little more than 40,000 days — or over a hundred years — we have gone from the first terrestrial flight to the first flight on another planet. Within that short time, the amount of fuel burned and, unfortunately, even lives lost have been immense. In exchange, flight has completely transformed everything from commerce to warfare and has led to the birth of completely new industries. As aviation progressed, fuel efficiency improved and mortality rates also dropped immensely. In the digital realm, blockchain technology could be equally as transformative, with applications in everything from trade, exchange, cooperation, identity, and resource usage management. At the moment, these advancements come at the cost of high levels of electricity usage. This is a concern that should and will be addressed.Related: Ignore the headlines — Bitcoin mining is already greener than you thinkThe issue is that the current narrative uses this high electricity usage to call blockchain projects, and especially Bitcoin (BTC), unsustainable. This is not only detrimental to blockchain projects — especially from an investment and adoption perspective — but it is also untrue.Sustainability is judged on the three broad metrics of ESG — environmental, social and governance. The current debate — characterized by lack of nuance on the one side and needless finger-pointing on the other — has only focused on the environmental aspect of sustainability. The social and governance aspects have been widely ignored, which leads to an inaccurate sustainability perception for both Bitcoin and blockchain projects in general.Related: Bitcoin miners can prove green potential by undergoing ESG ratings checkThe social aspect should be seen in the broader context of the economy-wide shift to platforms. Everything from ride-hailing to buying books to ordering take-out is now taking place on platforms. In this winner-takes-all world, the market power of successful platforms allows them to eventually dictate unfair terms to their workers.Tokenized blockchain projects have the potential to address this wrong by making possible the ownership of a platform based on a worker’s contribution. The result being workers benefiting from the growth of the platform instead of getting oppressed by it.Related: Understanding the systemic shift from digitization to tokenization of financial servicesBlockchain technology enables the transparent and automated execution of rules/procedures on a global scale. This capability is based on a combination of immutability, transparency, censorship-resistance, decentralized software execution and economic incentive exclusive to the blockchain.This makes the blockchain a rich proving ground for governance in the digital age — a proving ground which, as we have seen in the decentralized finance space, is making interesting progress on an almost daily basis. It is only a matter of time until the lessons learned spill over into helping us better manage the global commons.Related: Decentralized parties: The future of on-chain governanceA piece of fabric and wood from the original Wright Flyer was taken to the surface of the moon by the Apollo 11 astronauts. The fabric and wood had no functional purpose beyond the symbolic tying of these two historic events together.It has been around 4,600 days since the Bitcoin whitepaper was published. With the breakneck speed of innovation in the blockchain space, the current blockchains — and their energy consumption — will also be icons of the past.It would therefore be more productive to take a more holistic view and steer toward a sustainable end result, rather than being overly judgemental of a work in progress — and losing possible social and governance gains, opening blockchain up to grifting and profiteering in the process.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
379,"On June 12, Bitcoin (BTC) mining pool Slush Pool mined block 687,285 with the transaction including a Taproot upgrade activation signal. That particular block was the 1,816th to include a signal for Taproot activation by a BTC miner within the difficulty epoch that lasted from May 30 to June 13.With 2,016 blocks created every difficulty period, crossing 1,816 blocks with a Taproot activation signal satisfied the 90% signaling threshold required to lock in the upgrade. This event meant that Taproot, Bitcoin’s first protocol upgrade in over four years, was set for its activation phase to be expected in mid-November.Apart from bringing an end to the signaling period that lasted about six weeks over three consecutive difficulty epochs, block 687,285 also brought forth a new milestone for the Bitcoin upgrade in development since 2018. BTC proponents say beyond the automatic activation happening near the end of the year, the focus should now shift to building wallets and other ecosystem applications that can leverage the improved scripting capabilities brought on by Taproot.Before getting into the nitty-gritty of what Taproot is and how it works, it is perhaps important to present at least a high-level explanation of how Bitcoin transactions work. When sending BTC from one wallet to another, the sender’s public address uses a private key to create a unique cryptographic signature.This cryptographic signature contains the necessary permissions that serve as proof to any nodes validating the transaction that the sender truly owns the funds being sent, thus fulfilling the spending condition. It is possible to create different spending conditions for unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).When UTXOs are spent, it becomes necessary to reveal all spending condition data — both the ones satisfied and the possible conditions that could have been met — a feature that comes with significant data usage and privacy implications. Taproot is an upgrade designed to solve this issue by masking spending conditions, except those that are in the branch of the script agreed upon by the transacting parties.In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Riccardo Casatta, Bitcoin developer and one-time Square crypto grant recipient, outlined the basic premise behind Taproot, stating, “The taproot upgrade includes a bunch of improvements, the most significant enhances privacy in the long term.” According to Casatta:With Taproot, it becomes possible to combine the public keys of all participating entities in a transaction to create a unique key. By creating a new output called Pay to Taproot (P2TR), it is possible to have output conditions with locked funds to a single public key rather than individual key or script hashes that require a complete accounting of all spending conditions included in a UTXO.This coalescing of multiple signatures into a single aggregate signature is based on Schnorr signatures. Taking advantage of the linear nature of Schnorr signatures, Taproot proponents say it will be possible to make multi-signature (multisig) indistinguishable from their single-signature counterparts, or as Casatta puts it:As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade achieved the 90% critical consensus among mining nodes on June 12. Indeed, the process received near-universal backing from miners, with all recognized mining pools signaling for Taproot.Slush Pool kicked off the process back in May, mining the first transaction block with a Taproot activation signal. It was, perhaps, fitting that the fifth-largest Bitcoin mining pool by hash rate distribution was also brought forth by the miner responsible for actually locking in the upgrade.Despite the fact that the process for commencing the signaling period slowed down with China’s May Day celebration, the consensus among miners to support the upgrade began to reach significant proportions by the second difficulty epoch. This near-unanimous support cemented the commitment expressed by miners even before the planned upgrade was merged into Bitcoin Core in late 2020.Related: South Koreans flock to crypto amid a heavy-handed regulation approachThe initial delays in attaining the required 90% consensus during the first month of the process were likely due to some miners needing to adjust certain firmware requirements to perform signaling. Thus, even soaring to about 70% within the first three days, the miner signaling percentage fluctuated between 40% and 70% over the first difficulty epoch.AntPool and F2Pool — ranked first and second in terms of hash rate distribution, respectively — were early supporters of the activation, as was Foundry USA. By May 17, every major mining pool was signaling for Taproot, including Binance with its maiden transaction block. BTC.Top was late to the party, as the mining pool reported having to run tests on protocols required to begin signaling for Taproot.Several Bitcoin developers agree that Taproot will offer a significant improvement in Bitcoin’s privacy. In a conversation with Cointelegraph earlier in June, Pieter Wuille, Bitcoin developer at Chaincode and one of the earliest proponents of the Taproot upgrade, remarked:Apart from masking certain spending conditions and making transactions indistinguishable, Taproot also offers a significant reduction in the block space occupied by transaction data. While this feature will reduce transaction throughput by compressing the data size associated with multisig transactions, it is hardly a panacea to Bitcoin’s scalability issues.However, it opens the door for smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain since the upgrade already lessens the amount of space needed for multisig transactions in a block. Smart contract transactions by nature involve interactions among several addresses and users.Related: Altcoins follow Bitcoin price’s lead as uncertainty grips crypto marketWith Taproot, these smart contract operations will not appear to be any different from a simple wallet-to-wallet BTC transfer. Detailing some of the likely smart contract use cases that could emerge once Taproot is activated later in 2021, Casatta told Cointelegraph:Many Bitcoin developers agree that beyond the November activation, network participants will need to create useful applications based on the upgrade. The upgrade itself will activate according to the terms in Bitcoin Improvement Protocol 341 (BIP-341) at block height 709,632.Taproot will be a soft-fork upgrade, meaning that network participants are not bound to adopt the change. However, given the likely fee advantages offered by the upgrade, service providers are likely to update their software to implement Taproot."
380,"Altcoin traders and investors should look for cover if Bitcoin (BTC) undergoes major price declines.So believes Filbfilb, an independent market analyst and co-founder of Decentrader trading suite. In a tweet published late Friday, the pseudonymous entity said a 30% crash in the Bitcoin market could prompt altcoins to drop twice as harder.When Bitcoin consolidated between $50,000 and $60,000 in the March-May period, altcoins exploded. Similarly, the recent correction in the Bitcoin market, which witnessed the flagship cryptocurrency falling from circa $65,000 to as low as $28,000, also had altcoins crash; still, to the levels, they held as support when Bitcoin was stuck in the $50K-$60K range.Filbfilb noted that altcoins have been facing a so-called ""catchup risk,"" hinting that even a small downside shift in the Bitcoin market could move altcoins twice lower. The statement appeared as Bitcoin prices plunged to $30,173 following a 15.58% week-to-date downside correction.""[Altcoins], therefore, carry significantly more downside risk than Bitcoin with [BTC/USD] threatening lows,"" tweeted Filbfilb. ""If bitcoin were to fall lower, losing another 30% worst case, I'd expect [altcoins] to correct to do 2x worse from here.""Bitcoin's declines across May and June pushed down its year-to-date performance to 5.71%. Meanwhile, while top-cap altcoins fell in tandem, their YTD returns fared far better.  For instance, Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, dropped by a little over 60% from its mid-April peak of $4,384. Nevertheless, its YTD returns came out to be 141% as of publishing time. Similarly, Dogecoin's YTD profits were 4,112% even after falling by almost 80% from its record high of $0.76.So it seems, altcoins provided better profit-taking opportunities to their holders than Bitcoin did. As a result, investors could offset their losses in the Bitcoin market by simply selling their altcoin profits for fiat and/or rotate the funds back into BTC.Of late, Bitcoin has been able to avoid a deeper pullback below $30,000 despite repeated attempts. Many analysts, including Mercuryo founder Alexander Vasiliev, sees Bitcoin's bullish resilience as a signal that it would eventually breakout above $40,000 and rise to its previous high levels near $64,000 in the mid to long term.However, some analysts who were previously bullish on Bitcoin have flipped their bias in the wake of the cryptocurrency's latest bearish correction.For instance, Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer of the multi-billion dollar investment firm Guggenheim Partners, told CNBC on Friday that he expects Bitcoin to fall to $15,000.In February, just as Bitcoin was tearing through $30,000-resistance, Minerd has predicted its price to hit $600,000.Clem Chambers, the chief executive of financial analytics website ADVFN.com, also flipped bearish for Bitcoin, noting that Bitcoin could fall back towards $20,000 owing to capitulation sentiment.

381,"Many traders entering cryptocurrency markets from traditional finance may look to derivatives as vehicles for price speculation and hedging. There are plenty of choices when it comes to exchanges and instruments; however, traders should consider a few key differences between crypto futures and traditional futures before dipping a toe into this rapidly growing market.Related: 3 things every crypto trader should know about derivatives exchangesTraders entering cryptocurrency from the traditional markets will be accustomed to futures contracts with a fixed expiration date. Although fixed expiration contracts can be found in cryptocurrency markets, a significant proportion of crypto futures trading is in perpetual contracts, also known as perpetual swaps. This variation of a futures contract does not have a fixed end date, meaning the trader can hold an open position indefinitely.Exchanges that offer perpetual contracts use a mechanism known as “funding rate” to periodically balance the price variances between the contract markets and the spot prices. If the funding rate is positive, the perpetual contract price is higher than the spot rate — longs pay shorts. Conversely, a negative funding rate means that shorts pay longs.Moreover, traders that come to cryptocurrency from traditional finance may be used to the portability of their positions across different exchanges. In contrast, cryptocurrency exchanges generally operate as walled gardens, meaning it’s impossible to transfer derivatives contracts across platforms.Related: Professional traders need a global crypto sea, not hundreds of lakesMost of the trading in cryptocurrency futures — around 85 to 90% — is yet to be regulated. This situation mainly arose because cryptocurrency futures markets sprang up while regulators were still grappling with more fundamental questions around the legal status of digital assets. BitMEX paved the way for cryptocurrency futures trading by using coin-margined and collateralized contracts. In doing so, the company avoided the regulatory requirements associated with fiat on-ramps. There are around a dozen major trading platforms currently, but only a small number of them have achieved regulated status.Both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Bakkt are regulated by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In Europe, Kraken Futures operates under a multilateral trading facility license awarded by the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority. In Switzerland, Vontobel and Leonteq offer mini-Bitcoin futures contracts via the SIX Swiss Exchange.The regulatory situation may preclude traders in some countries from participating in trading on non-regulated venues. This circumstance is particularly true of the U.S., where exchanges are mindful that the CFTC is now pursuing BitMEX for violating Anti-Money Laundering regulations and the Bank Secrecy Act.However, the U.S.-regulated crypto futures platforms have expanded their range of instruments beyond pure Bitcoin (BTC) futures, likely in response to increasing demand. The CME, for example, recently branched out beyond Bitcoin futures and options to provide Ether (ETH) futures too. In addition, Bakkt also offers Bitcoin monthly futures and options.Unregulated platforms offer futures contracts and perpetual swaps against a broader range of altcoins, although only to traders in countries where they are permitted to operate. In any case, most liquidity remains concentrated in BTC and ETH futures, at least for now.Differing regulatory landscapes, combined with how perpetual contracts are managed, result in some practical differences between crypto futures and traditional futures. As there is no central counterparty clearing system, exchanges expose themselves to a high degree of risk, particularly given that many offer high leverages of up to 125 times. Therefore, losing positions that reach the maintenance margin will be liquidated.Exchanges typically divert any profits from liquidations into an insurance fund, which exists to protect traders’ profits when their counterparty does not have sufficient margin to cover the trade. The presence and relative health of an insurance fund is a crucial consideration when using an unregulated exchange. Without a fund, or if the fund becomes too low to cover the losses incurred by liquidations, profitable traders take on the risk of having their positions “auto-deleveraged” by the exchange.Another critical operational consideration is exchange downtime. Many of the unregulated platforms have a reputation for servers crashing during periods of high volatility, resulting in traders being unable to close their positions before being liquidated. Therefore, it is worth researching a platform’s history of downtime before opening an account.The cryptocurrency futures markets generally have a very low barrier to entry. A trader can open an account, undergo the “know your customer” process, deposit funds, and start trading within a matter of minutes.In contrast, the barriers to entry for exchange-traded futures are high due to the contract sizes involved, which are intended for institutional traders. This situation is also reflected in the regulated crypto futures offerings. Both the CME and Bakkt, the two regulated crypto futures trading venues, have contract sizes of 5 BTC and 1 BTC, respectively. With prices currently exceeding $31,000, these contracts are evidently only intended for those willing to make a significant investment.However, blockchain offers significant potential to transform the futures markets beyond cryptocurrencies through asset tokenization. Suppose a futures contract for the Nasdaq-100 or S&P 500 was made available as a token. In that case, it could be traded in fractional increments, lowering barriers to entry and introducing new sources of liquidity into traditional markets.Related: Understanding the systemic shift from digitization to tokenization of financial servicesSuch a scenario may benefit those looking to introduce a more fine-grained diversification to their portfolio, which is currently only possible via contracts for differences (CFD). While they perform a similar role in the financial markets, CFDs are only available via brokers, which reduces transparency for the trader. It also fragments the available liquidity in the broader markets.Despite their rapid growth, cryptocurrency futures markets are still very much in their infancy, particularly since the institutional inflow to crypto is only getting started. As the markets grow and develop, we will likely see new and more sophisticated instruments emerge, along with some blurring of the boundaries between traditional and digital finance. Furthermore, it seems likely that the regulatory situation will continue to evolve as more funds flow in. One thing is for sure: cryptocurrency futures have a long future ahead.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

382,"Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours. This fee ensures there are no exchange risk imbalances. Even though buyers' and sellers' open interest is matched at all times, leverage can vary, and when buyers (longs) are demanding more leverage, the funding rate turns positive. Thus, they are the ones paying the fees to the sellers (shorts).However, the opposite situation occurs when shorts require additional leverage, and this causes the funding rate to turn negative.The Bitcoin (BTC) futures funding rate has been negative since May 18 (37 days), and this situation indicates buyers' lack of appetite for leverage longs.Historically, this indicator shifts between 0% and 2% per week, although it might sustain higher levels for months during bull runs. On the other hand, a negative funding rate enduring more than a couple of days used to be uncommon.However, 2020 provided a different picture as Bitcoin faced an extreme price correction in mid-March, taking 60 days to retake the $9,300 support. Another nosedive took place in early September as the price stalled from $12,000, and it would only recover after 50 days later.Take notice of how the weekly funding rate for March to November 2020 was mostly negative, indicating that sellers (shorts) were demanding more leverage. The current situation resembled these periods in 2020, and some investors correlate a negative funding rate with buying opportunities.Related: Data shows derivatives had little to do with Bitcoin's drop to $29KKi-Young Ju, the CEO of on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, has shown how historically, a low funding rate ""could be a buy signal.""In this spot-driven & up-only market, a low funding rate could be a buy signal.

It seems not a good idea to wait for a correction when institutions buying $BTC.

Furthermore, at what point should one open a position if a negative funding rate can last for 60 days?Cointelegraph previously showed how combining the funding rate indicator with the futures basis rate provides a better analysis of how professional traders are positioned. The annualized basis is measured by the price gap between fixed-month futures and regular spot markets.As depicted above, calling the bottom on the basis indicator right now could be premature because it has been bouncing near 0% since June 18.Right now, it is impossible to estimate the timing or trigger that will cause buyers to gain confidence and finally bring the futures market premium back to 10%.For traders trying to 'catch the falling knife,' a better strategy could be adding 25% of the long position now and scale bids every $2,000 below the $30,000 resistance.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

383,"Bitcoin (BTC) price remains jittery and throughout this week, every relief rally is being sold into. This is a classic bear market reaction and may not end in a hurry. However, the current price action should not worry investors because the longer the time spent in a bottoming formation, the stronger the base for the next leg of the up-move.In a recent note to investors, JPMorgan said that Bitcoin’s fair value may remain between $23,000 and $35,000 over the medium term. The bank pointed out that outflows from crypto Bitcoin funds since the fall on May 19, show a lack of demand from institutional investors. Another reason that may be capping Bitcoin’s price is the massive unlocking of Bitcoin from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust fund at the end of the six-month lock-up period.None of the events of the past few days have changed the long-term view of Bitcoin. Jason Urban, the co-head of trading at Galaxy Digital said that Bitcoin may “see something north of $70,000 by the end of the year.”Although not a game-changer, the Purpose Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has seen an average inflow of 86.15 Bitcoin between May 15 and June 24, according to Glassnode data. This has boosted the ETF’s assets under management to 21,114 BTC. This shows that smart investors are gradually chipping away instead of trying to time the bottom.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the critical support levels that could be touched if the downtrend continues.Bitcoin’s rebound off the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone has turned down from the 20-day exponential moving average ($35,788) today. The downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory indicate an advantage to the bears.The sellers will now make one more attempt to sink the price below the support zone. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could start the next leg of the down move and plummet to $20,000.However, the bulls will not give up easily. They are likely to defend the support zone aggressively. If the price rebounds off this zone once again, the bulls will try to push the price above the 20-day EMA.If they manage to do that, the BTC/USDT pair could continue its consolidation between $28,000 and $42,451.67 for the next few days. A breakout and close above this range will be the first sign that the downtrend may have ended.Ether’s (ETH) rebound off the $1,728.74 support fizzled out at $2,045 on June 23. This suggests a lack of buyers at higher levels. Both moving averages have turned down and the RSI is near the oversold zone, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the downside.If the price turns down and breaks below the $1,728.74 support, the ETH/USDT pair could start the next leg of the downtrend. The pair could then drop to $1,536.92 and then $1,293.18. The deeper the fall, the longer it will take for the bulls to start the next leg of the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again rebounds off $1,728.74, it will suggest that the bulls are defending this level aggressively. A breakout and close above the 20-day EMA ($2,248) will be the first indication that a bottoming formation may have started.Binance Coin’s (BNB) bounce off the $211.70 support is facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($332). This suggests that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies.The bears will now make one more attempt to sink the price below the $211.70 support. If they manage to do that, the BNB/USDT pair could start the next leg of the downtrend. The next support on the downside is $200 and then $126.75.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the $211.70 support, it will suggest strong accumulation by the bulls at this level. If the buyers propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to $433. A breakout and close above this resistance will be the first sign that the downtrend may be over.Cardano (ADA) rebounded off the $1 support on June 22 but the bulls seem to have hit a wall at the 20-day EMA ($1.42). This suggests that the bears have not thrown in the towel yet and are trying to maintain the upper hand.The sellers will now try to pull the price down to $1. This is an important support to watch out for because it has not been broken on a closing basis since Feb. 23. Therefore, a break below $1 may result in a long liquidation.The ADA/USDT pair could then drop to $0.68 and if the selling intensifies, the decline could even extend to $0.40.However, the bulls will have other plans. They will again try to defend the $1 support. If they succeed, the pair may break out of the 20-day EMA and rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($1.61).Dogecoin (DOGE) rebounded off the $0.15 support on June 22 and reached the 20-day EMA ($0.28) today. After the sharp relief rally of the past three days, the bears are likely to defend the zone between the 20-day EMA and the neckline aggressively.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance zone, the bears will try to pull the price back to $0.15. A break and close below this level will suggest that traders sold their positions during the current rally. The DOGE/USDT pair could then drop to $0.10.On the other hand, if the bulls defend the next drop to the $0.21 support, it will signal strength. A breakout and close above the neckline will be the first sign that the pair’s correction could be over and a bottoming formation may begin.XRP’s rebound off the $0.50 support in the past few days could not even reach the breakdown level of $0.75. This suggests a lack of urgency among the traders to buy at these levels.The bears may now sell aggressively and try to pull the price below the psychological level at $0.50. If they do that, the XRP/USDT pair could decline to the support line of the descending channel.On the contrary, if the bulls buy the next dip to the $0.50 support, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA to suggest that the selling pressure is reducing.Polkadot’s (DOT) rebound off $13 has been weak as the bulls have not even been able to push the price to the 20-day EMA ($20). This suggests that traders are in no great hurry to buy at the current levels.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 36 indicate that bears have the upper hand. If bears pull the price below $13, the DOT/USDT pair may resume the downtrend and plummet to $10 and later to $7.50.Conversely, if the price rebounds off $13 and rises above $17, the pair may rise to the 20-day EMA. A breakout and close above this resistance will open the doors for a move to $26.50. If the price turns down from this level, the pair may consolidate between $13 and $26.50 for the next few days.Uniswap’s (UNI) rebound off $13 hit a wall at $18.60 on June 24. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone indicate that bears are in control.The bears will now try to sink the price below the $13 support. If they manage to sustain the price below the support, the UNI/USDT pair could witness further selling. That may result in a decline to $10 and then to $7.Alternatively, if the bulls again defend the $13 support, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The buyers will then try to drive the price above the 20-day EMA ($20). If they succeed, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($26) and then to $30.Related: Elon Musk agrees to speak with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey at Bitcoin eventThe bulls are struggling to thrust Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the breakout level at $538.11, which suggests a lack of urgency among the bulls to accumulate at the current levels.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is near the oversold territory, suggesting that bears are in command. The sellers will now try to cement their advantage by sinking the price below the $370 support.If they do that, the BCH/USDT pair could drop to the psychological support at $300 and then to $270. Contrary to this assumption, if the price again rebounds off $370, it will indicate strong buying at lower levels. The bulls will then attempt to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($565). If that happens, the pair may rally to the 50-day SMA ($782).Litecoin’s (LTC) rebound off the $118 support lacks strength. This suggests that traders are not convinced that a bottom has been made. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that bears are in command.If the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $118, the LTC/USDT pair could resume its downtrend. The next support on the downside is $100 and if this psychological level also cracks, the decline may extend to $70.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off $118 once again, the bulls will again try to push the price to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will suggest that the sellers are losing their grip. The pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($206).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

384,"Bitcoin has a good chance of becoming the world’s reserve currency, although we are  “at least 10 years away from that,” said Dan Held, Kraken's head of growth, in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. According to Held, the transition to ""hyperbitcoinization"" —  a world where Bitcoin (BTC) is adopted by billions of users — starts with retail users, then institutional investors, and finally, governments getting involved.The permissionless nature of Bitcoin is the fundamental property that is leading this transition. “It’s true, free money. It’s money that no one can control other than you,” he pointed out.He said that in developing countries, Bitcoin is mainly valuable for avoiding censorship — while in the Western world, Bitcoin is attractive as a hedge against central banks' money-printing.

385,"Bitcoin (BTC) and the U.S. dollar fell in tandem while the S&P 500 refreshed its record high at open on Friday as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation indicator surged to its highest levels in almost three decades.According to data shared by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, the US Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCI) rose 0.5% in May, coming in below the estimation of 0.6%.Nevertheless, the expenditure rose 3.4% year-over-year, the highest level since 1991. The Federal Reserve treats core PCI as its benchmark metric to gauge inflation. The U.S. central bank has indicated that it would tolerate inflation above 2% until it ensures a stronger labor-market recovery.The prospects of higher inflation fueled volatile bullish rallies across the risk-on markets in 2020, including Bitcoin and the U.S. stock market.Investors considered them as better safe-havens as the Fed elected to hold interest rates near-zero and maintained its $120B monthly asset purchase program to contain the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. economy.However, the central bank's policy ended up pushing the U.S. bond yields lower while hurting the dollar's demand globally, thereby shifting investors to riskier haven alternatives, including Bitcoin.But the flagship cryptocurrency dipped after the latest PCI readings, hinting that investors chose to ignore its safe-haven narrative over risks concerning China's latest crypto ban and amid speculations that the U.S. would impose strict regulations on the cryptocurrency sector, on the whole.The BTC/USD exchange rate slipped to an intraday low of $32,350 shorty after the New York opening bell Friday. Meanwhile, Gold, Bitcoin's top safe-haven rival, recorded early morning gains after higher core CPI readings, with the August Comex Gold Futures trading 0.73% higher at $1,789.70 an ounce in the morning session.Investors also snubbed the so-called safest safe-haven, the U.S. dollar. As a result, the greenback's index against a basket of foreign currencies fell 0.33% to 91.525 in the early morning trade Friday. It later recovered back to 91.749.Alexander Vasiliev, co-founder and CCO of Mercuryo said that demand for the dollar among corporate and retail investors would remain weaker against the prospects of higher inflation. Instead, they would rather hedge in assets with lower depreciation potential. He explained:Bitcoin dipped also as investors' focus shifted towards the Wall Street equity markets following President Joe Biden's latest stimulus deal worth $1T. The S&P 500 index surged 0.27% to an all-time high of 4,280.55. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite went up 0.1%.Francesco Sandrini, senior multi-asset strategist at fund manager Amundi, stated that inflation readings would keep going higher in the months ahead. Meanwhile, markets would struggle to find confidence in terms of how to protect them from higher consumer prices, especially as the Fed officials send mixed signals about whether inflation should result in tighter monetary policy.For instance, Fed's chair Jay Powell has called the recent inflation spikes in the U.S. economy, which could wipe long-term returns from stocks and bonds, as ""transient"" in nature. But St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said on Thursday that inflation may keep rising in the sessions ahead.The Federal Open Market Committee's latest set of economic projections took a hawkish turn as it suggested dual-rate hikes in 2023. As a result, Bitcoin turned lower on the news.Related: 4 reasons why Paul Tudor Jones' 5% Bitcoin exposure advice is difficult for major funds""We remain unsure as to exactly what will happen to inflation over the coming 5 years,"" noted CoinShares, a digital asset management firm, in a report published on June 21.""But we see adding bitcoin and other real assets as a prudent measure to protect portfolios from the tail-risk of out-of-control inflation,"" the firm added.Vasiliev noted that strong anti-inflation narrative would keep investors' interest in Bitcoin in the coming months, adding:"
386,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell precipitously on Friday after a rejection above $35,000 sparked a rout toward familiar support.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as it shed over $2,500 during trading on Friday.The pair had hit local highs of $35,400 overnight before abruptly reversing trajectory to fall below $33,000.For popular trader Crypto Ed, the situation was similar to events last month after BTC/USD first bounced at $30,000 support.“Current, sluggish PA reminds me of a similar situation a few weeks ago..... I thought we did a 1-5 and started next cycle but after 1 more top, BTC made a deeper correction,” he commented on an accompanying chart.That would place Bitcoin in a position to rechallenge the $20,000 corridor, which it briefly broke into several days ago.As Cointelegraph reported, the mood among many traders remains skewed to the cautious side after BTC/USD failed to reach a $37,000 target before its latest rejection. The possibility of a new lower low is thus far from off the cards.Signs of underlying confidence nonetheless remain.Related: Bulls on parade: Galaxy Digital and Alameda pundits tip market recoveryOn Friday, it was again El Salvador and its Bitcoin law in the spotlight after president Nayib Bukele announced that every eligible citizen would receive $30 free in BTC for downloading its wallet.Institutional bullishness, meanwhile, came in the form of the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which continued to add to its assets under management throughout the price dip.Meanwhile, altcoins were flat, with no single asset managing to break out of established trading zones."
387,"The Bank of Tanzania is reportedly working to overturn its ban on crypto amid favorable cryptocurrency comments made by the country’s president.According to Reuters, Tanzania’s central bank has begun working on directives from the country’s federal government that could see a reversal of its November 2019 crypto ban.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, president Hassan urged the central bank to begin exploring Bitcoin (BTC) and digital assets earlier this month.At the time, Hassan enjoined the Bank of Tanzania to keep up with the times, given the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies.These favorable comments on crypto came on the heels of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law and a wave of positive BTC sentiment across several nations in Latin America.However, in Africa, crypto-related regulations beyond central bank bans are yet to emerge. Back in February, Nigeria’s central bank also prohibited financial institutions in the country from servicing crypto exchanges.For Abdulmajid Nsekela, chairman of the Tanzania Bankers Association, the move could help to diversify financial transactions in the country that are currently dominated by cash payments.Related: Tanzanian president urges central bank to prepare for cryptoNsekela also echoed the president’s comments about the Bank of Tanzania needing to become better acquainted with the crypto market, adding, “The most challenging element for regulators is to be caught by surprise by innovations.”According to data from Useful Tulips — a platform that tracks peer-to-peer BTC trading across the globe — Tanzania ranks seventh in peer-to-peer trading volume in Sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria still accounts for more than half of the region’s Bitcoin trading activity.While clear-cut crypto regulations are yet to emerge on the continent, some nations are working toward floating central bank digital currencies. Indeed, the central banks of both Nigeria and Ghana have issued announcements to that effect in June."
388,"As Bitcoin’s (BTC) price failed to hold its breath above $35,000 on Thursday, JPMorgan expects an overall bearish movement below the critical price level based on the BTC-to-gold volatility ratio. In a note sent to investors on Wednesday, JPMorgan detailed its reasoning to see the fair value of Bitcoin between $23,000 and $35,000 over the medium term. The banking giant previously pictured a $140,000 roadmap if the biggest cryptocurrency matches gold’s allocation and volatility profile.But that’s off the table for the foreseeable future, according to JPMorgan’s note, which predicts that “full convergence or equalization of volatilities or allocations [between gold and Bitcoin] is unlikely in the foreseeable future.“JPMorgan also said that China’s crackdown on mining operations would have a positive impact on Bitcoin over the medium term, “as it accelerates a shift away from China’s high share in bitcoin’s hash rate, reducing concentration.”Not many institutions are joining MicroStrategy’s hunt to buy the dip. “More than a month after the May 19 crypto crash, bitcoin funds continue to bleed, even as inflows into physical gold ETFs stopped,” JPMorgan said, adding:Related: Bitcoin price dips below $34K as day of Grayscale’s BTC unlocking draws nearAccording to JPMorgan, another major factor preventing a possible bull run is the end of a six-month lock-up period for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust fund, which saw a nearly $4-billion inflow in December and January. As Cointelegraph reported, July 19 will see the most significant single unlocking day, with 16,000 BTC worth around $627 million released.Following the April all-time high, Bitcoin has been hovering between $30,000 and $40,000 for the last couple of weeks. After diving below $29,000 on Tuesday, BTC’s price is moving around $34,000, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView data."
389,"The world’s first regulated Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) actually benefited from the recent price dip, data shows.As on-chain analytics service Glassnode noted on Thursday, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF continued to add to its assets under management throughout the second half of May.In an unusual success story from the past few weeks, Canada’s Purpose did not see a significant reduction in holdings or demand after BTC/USD hit $30,000 and under.Beginning May 15, an average of 86.15 BTC per day entered the ETF for a total of 3,446 BTC between then and Thursday.In total, Purpose now holds 21,114 BTC worth around $720 million.“Ever since the May 19th capitulation event, the Purpose Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) just keeps stacking sats,” popular Twitter account Dilution-proof summarized in one of various positive reactions to the data.Purpose was the first such Bitcoin ETF to get the green light from regulators in February 2021. As Cointelegraph reported, the United States has yet to respond, but should the products likewise get a debut there, the impact could be more significant, given the difference in size between the U.S. and Canadian market.“How many countries are going to have Bitcoin ETFs trading before the United States?” Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief technology officer of Casa, quizzed this week.The news provides a pleasing counter-narrative to the institutional trials facing Bitcoin post price drop.Related: Is Wall Street becoming less interested in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust?The coming few weeks will see unlocking of BTC stored in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), something that is expected to heighten already intense selling pressure.one thing we haven't discussed yet - the grayscale $GBTC unlock schedule is looking really crusty

390,"The president of El Salvador has announced the government will airdrop $30 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) to every adult citizen of the country.The announcement was welcomed by Bitcoiners, with influencers speculating that El Salvador’s government will need to purchase the required BTC it intends to distribute adding more than $100 million in buying pressure on markets.Quickly googled estimates of the adult population of El Salvador varied, with on-chain analyst Willy Woo tweeting that Bitcoin’s global user base will grow by 2.5% thanks to the influx of 4.5 million Salvadorans.Others placed the Salvadoran adult population as high as 6.5 million (which is actually the total population), with Yahoo Finance anchor Zack Guzman using the figure for some rough, back-of-the-envelope calculations, suggesting that $195 million worth of Bitcoin will be airdropped across the country.6 million people added to the crypto ecosystem in one go. pic.twitter.com/DVoW6vLrAKExact figures are hard to find, but Statista shows that in 2019, the population aged 15 and above was 4.72 million.However, Crypto Twitter’s euphoria may be be slightly premature, as local publication Prensa Latina notes El Salvador’s citizens will only receive the free Bitcoin after downloading the government-issued cryptocurrency wallet application.The news was announced during a Friday press conference, with president Nayib Bukele stating the government’s “wallet app will even work anywhere with a cell connection, and you won’t have to have a cell plan for the app.”President Bukele also stated that the country’s much-celebrated Bitcoin law recognizing BTC as legal currency nationwide will come into effect on Sept. 7.Related: Opposition poses constitutional challenge to El Salvador's Bitcoin lawEl Salvador’s Bitcoin law was passed roughly two weeks ago.

391,"U.S. company Athena intends to supply El Salvador’s new crypto-based economy with 1500 Bitcoin ATMs, a company representative has confirmed.The rollout will start small, trialing a few dozen machines to establish a business model. The Chicago headquartered firm plans to invest more than $1 million to install cryptocurrency ATMs, targeting regions where residents receive remittances from abroad.Along with installing the new machines it will also hire staff and open an office to carry out operations in El Salvador.Athena currently operates just two ATMs of this type in El Salvador, one at El Zonte beach as part of an experiment called “Bitcoin Beach” aimed at making the town one of the world's first crypto economies, and the other in El Tunco, according to CNN.Athena's director for Latin America, Matias Goldenhörn, told Reuters that Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele had “presented us with a tough challenge of 1,500 ATMs, we will go for that, but in phases. We are a private company and we want to ensure that our development in the country is sustainable.”On June 17, Athena posted about its plans to expand in the country in the wake of lawmakers passing a bill to make Bitcoin legal tender.

392,"PlanB, the brainchild behind the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model, has revealed he is feeling “uneasy” about his renowned price predictions due to the recent downtrend in markets.The stock-to-flow (S2F) model, which has predicted Bitcoin (BTC) prices with some degree of accuracy over the past two years, has been called into question by some of PlanB’s followers in a recent Twitter poll.The anonymous analyst surveyed his followers on Monday, asking them what price they thought BTC would reach by the end of the year. He used the results to compare them to a similar survey in March when market sentiment was overwhelmingly bullish.Of the 124,595 respondents to the latest poll, 41% thought that BTC prices would remain below $100,000 by the end of the year, which would invalidate the S2F model. That’s two and a half times the 16% in the previous poll who thought the lazer-eyes crowd would be disappointed this year.What a difference 3 months make!

41% now thinks bitcoin will stay below $100K in 2021 (invalidating S2F model) vs 16% in March (when BTC was $55K). pic.twitter.com/S9PKR8FSnbPlanB, who originally published the price predictor in March 2019, pinned a message admitting that even he feels a little “uneasy” when BTC prices deviate from the model. However, the analyst noted that the model had managed to hold previously in March 2019, again in March 2020 when the pandemic caused a global market meltdown, and once more in September 2020.Even for me it is always a bit uneasy when bitcoin price is at the lower bound of the stock-to-flow model. Will it hold (like Mar 2019 when I published S2F, or Mar 2020 Covid, or Sep 2020 with BTC stuck at $10K) and is this another buying opportunity? Or will S2F be invalidated? pic.twitter.com/iIjTC2Ncy3Preston Pysh, founder of The Investors Podcast Network, commented that it was difficult for a model to account for a blizzard of bad news that has accelerated the market downturn.The model is a calculation of a ratio based on the existing supply of Bitcoin against how much is entering circulation. The scarcer the asset becomes due to the four-year halving cycles, the higher the price. PlanB’s model predicts an average price of $288,000 over the next three years.Related: $288K BTC price 'still in play' says PlanB as Bloomberg champions Bitcoin halvingAt the time of writing, Bitcoin gained 2.9% over the past 24 hours to trade at $34,450 according to CoinGecko.

393,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape, and enterprise blockchain integrations.This week in China felt like one giant mining-farm sized pile of FUD. This is usually a pretty good indication that a bottom is close to being in, but one can never be too sure when it comes to downwards volatility in cryptocurrency. Canaan, one of the largest mining companies in China, announced it was setting up shop in neighboring Kazakhstan. This is an ideal compromise for Canaan as it can remain close to China, while mitigating their regulatory risk. Reading between the lines, it seems like the plan is to mostly continue administration of the company from China while sending the machines overseas.This would put a wrench in the works of the Bitcoin purists who believe that the crackdowns are a good way to break up China’s dominance in the mining industry. Just this week, a professor at a university in Singapore wrote in Chinese that the shift to a more decentralized network would be a good thing. This raised some eyebrows for the use of a made up word that translates roughly to ‘de-China-ization’, but the article holds even less weight when large mining companies like Canaan are able to shift physical equipment overseas but still remain in control of the governance.On June 21, CNBC’s Beijing Bureau Chief Eunice Yoon posted on Twitter that a logistics company in Guangzhou was shipping 3,000 kilograms worth of mining hardware to Maryland, US. According to her claim, the price was $9.37 per kilogram. Some quick math reveals that the total cost would be less than the price of one Bitcoin, at least at the time of writing.Cointelegraph reported on June 23 that massive mining company Bitmain was suspending sales of mining hardware in a move to support the over-supplied secondhand markets. According to the article, sales of hashing power in China has seen a decrease of around 75% since the Spring. Bitmain is reportedly moving operations abroad as well, which would be a major move for the hardware manufacturing giant.Francis Suarez, everyone’s favorite Bitcoin-friendly mayor, was at it again on June 18 when he announced that all Chinese Bitcoin miners were welcome in Miami. The announcement was translated and posted on Sina Finance’s Blockchain Weibo account, which attracted over 53 comments from surprised netizens. Most of these user comments were negative in nature however, both towards Suarez and Bitcoin in general. A large portion of Weibo users hold cryptocurrencies in ill-regard, especially those that have been investing in the stagnant Chinese stock market.Amber, a cryptocurrency service provider based in Hong Kong, completed a Series B funding round worth $100m.

While traders' sentiment may have improved slightly, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman suggested that investors could be waiting for the $6 billion in Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) quarterly futures and options to expire on June 25 before making a more decisive move.The crypto market wasn't the only market to rally today. Traditional markets also rose to new highs after U.S. President Joe Biden revealed that he had reached an agreement on a $953 billion bipartisan infrastructure spending plan with the Senate.Following the announcement, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each rallied to new record intraday highs and closed the day up 24.65 points and 97.98 points respectively, while the Dow gained more than 322 points on the day. As one would expect, altcoins also surged higher as Bitcoin price and traditional markets moved higher. Ether (ETH) rallied back above the psychologically important $2,000 level, while Tron (TRX) and Celo gained 26% and 28% respectively. CELO's move appears to be driven by the listing of its Celo Euro (cEUR) stablecoin on KuCoin exchange.

395,"Bitcoin’s price has slightly recovered from its sharp dip below $29,000, but generally, the past month has not been generous to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Bitcoin has failed to break the $40,000 resistance multiple times, and the recent dip to a six-month low at $28,800 was a startling sign for many investors. After an incredible start in 2021, Ether peaked at $4,380 on May 12 but has dropped 55% since then. Unlike the leading cryptocurrency, the Ethereum network faces competition from projects that do not depend on proof-of-work, hence not facing the bottleneck issues that caused transaction fees to skyrocket.Whenever markets disappoint traders with a negative surprise, traders quickly seek external explanations for their failure to interpret signals. But, in reality, a clear indication that China was concerned about the crypto mining energy consumption came out on April 30, six weeks ahead of the initial price crash.On May 6, recently confirmed United States Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler punted to congress on providing more regulatory oversight to the crypto space. However, in defense of excessively optimistic investors, similar promises have circulated for over four years.Regardless of the many reasons behind the recent negative market performance, traders like to blame someone for their mistakes, and what better scapegoat than derivatives markets?Cointelegraph was the first news outlet to analyze the $2.5-billion Bitcoin futures expiry, potentially giving bears a $450-million lead if the price fails to hold $32,000 on Friday. On June 12, Cointelegraph said that Ether’s $1.5-billion monthly options expiry would be a make-or-break moment, as 73% of the neutral-to-bullish options would be worthless below $2,200.Updated open interest figures show a $1.36-billion open interest for Ether options and another $500 million worth of futures contracts to expire on Friday. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s options open interest has grown to $2.64 billion, while another $1.44 billion is set to expire in futures markets.To understand whether derivatives markets, mainly the quarterly expiries, hold such a significant impact on prices, investors need to evaluate the past expiries.In November 2020, Bitcoin initiated a strong rally, accumulating 75% gains ahead of the December expiry.Over 102,000 Bitcoin options matured on Christmas day, but there was no apparent impact. Instead, the bull trend continued as Bitcoin subsequently rallied another 69% in 12 days.March 2021, on the other hand, showed completely different price action. Bitcoin’s price plunged 14% ahead of the options expiry, although it fully recovered over the next four days.It is worth noting that on March 22, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, “Bitcoin is too volatile to be money“ and is “backed by nothing.”In that same week, billionaire fund manager Ray Dalio raised concerns on a possible “U.S. Bitcoin ban.”If March 2021 could have built a possible case for dumping activity ahead of the expiry, the previous year faced an opposite movement.Bitcoin went on a 31% bull run in the 10 days leading to the March 26, 2020, expiry. However, an 11% correction took place the following day, therefore, potentially building a case for investors to cite “manipulation.” However, the 45% hash rate drop that surrounded the date partially explains the sell-off.The March 26 expiry did not seem to significantly impact prices because Bitcoin dropped 2% before the event and another 2% over the next two days. However, an exact inverse pattern occurred on the September 2020 expiry when Bitcoin hiked 2% ahead of Sept. 25 and continued to increase by 2% over the following two days.As the data from the previous five quarterly expiries show, there is absolutely no indication of a pump-and-dump (or inverse) movement ahead of the derivative events.For investors and traders waiting for a bottom confirmation, the answer probably lies in Bitcoin’s hash rate recomposition.One should also account for Chinese over-the-counter traders reestablishing their fiat gateways after the recent nationwide ban on cryptocurrency transactions.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

396,"Mode Global Holdings, a London Stock Exchange-listed fintech group, has secured major regulatory approvals for cryptocurrency and fintech operations in the United Kingdom.The company announced Thursday that Mode has secured its Electronic Money Institution license and AMLD5 registration from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.The AMLD5 registration has been granted to Mode’s crypto arm Fibermode Limited, establishing it as an official crypto asset firm in the United Kingdom, pursuant to the amended regulations on money laundering, terrorist financing and transfer of funds.The AMLD5 registration is a requirement for crypto-related businesses in the country that fall within the scope of money laundering regulations. According to the announcement, Mode is the fifth company to have received this registration to date since the FCA became the official AML supervisor of the crypto industry in the U.K. in January 2020.Alongside the AMLD5, Mode’s subsidiary Greyfoxx Limited also acquired the EMI license, which enables Mode to offer a “range of innovative financial services” to both businesses and consumers in the United Kingdom, the announcement notes.Following the acquisition of new regulatory approvals, Mode is planning to further expand its crypto services, including decommissioning its investment product known as the “Bitcoin Jar.” The product aims to allow Mode customers to use Bitcoin (BTC) to generate BTC interest rather than simply holding it in a wallet or on an exchange.Mode CEO Ryan Moore noted that the new regulatory developments provide a major step in Mode's mission to deliver a trusted and regulated environment. “It means we now have the ability to scale our operations and continue delivering innovative payments products for our customers under our own EMI licence.

397,"Bitcoin (BTC) is on a “lower left to upper right trend” and its volatility should not scare investors, the former head of the New York Stock Exchange says.In an interview with CNBC on June 23, Thomas Farley revealed long-term convictions about Bitcoin and dismissed concerns over BTC price losses.Coming a day after CNBC pundit Jim Cramer admitted that he sold his Bitcoin stash, suggesting that BTC/USD was going as low as $10,000, Farley provided some much-needed mainstream bullishness.“With respect to the recent price moves, I’m kind of sanguine about them — Bitcoin’s a very volatile asset class, in part because it’s a new asset class,” he told the network.With mining upheaval coming from China still on everyone’s lips, popular mainstream criticism of Bitcoin’s energy usage was also swiftly cast aside as a temporary issue.“I think this kerfuffle is an interesting conversation, but by and large I think it’ll be resolved because I think the blockchain at its core adds to its efficiency and in fact will add to energy efficiency over time,” he continued.When it comes to Bitcoin as “digital gold,” however, Farley was more conservative in his predictions.Now firmly beneath a trillion-dollar market cap, Bitcoin must transform in order to take on store-of-value safe-havens.Related: Joining the ranks: Bitcoin’s correlation with gold and stocks is growing“I think the upper bound for now is gold, which is about a $10 trillion market cap,” he added.Proponents argue that Bitcoin, by its very nature, faces just a matter of time before eclipsing gold thanks to the latter’s ultimately infinite supply and inability to beat Bitcoin in all aspects of “money.”The precious metal saw a major sell-off last week after comments on policy from the United States Federal Reserve.To beat gold, Bitcoin would need to trade at more than $533,000 with the current supply."
398,"New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) has partnered with Q2, a firm specializing in providing digital services to financial institutions, to provide access to Bitcoin (BTC) for bank account holders in the United States.According to a release issued on Wednesday, the partnership will potentially open up Bitcoin buying, selling and custody channels to about 18.3 million bank customers in America.Indeed, Q2 provider internet banking services to about 30% of the Top 100 U.S. banks and serves over a tenth of the country’s digital banking customers.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, NYDIG began working towards providing Bitcoin trading services to Americans via their bank accounts. At the time, the firm partnered with fintech outfit Fidelity National Information Services to provide U.S. lenders with the ability to offer crypto trading services to their customers.Apart from Q2, NYDIG has also partnered with cloud-based digital banking service provider Alkami and global payment services outfit Fiserv to enable Bitcoin access for more customers of financial institutions.Detailing the specifics of its partnership with NYDIG in a separate announcement, Fiserv revealed that its collaboration was tailored towards banks and credit unions amid the growing interest for BTC.First Foundation Bank, a California-based financial institution, is reportedly working with NYDIG and Fiserv to onboard Bitcoin trading and custody for its customers. Back in April, the bank’s parent company, First Foundation Inc., invested in NYDIG to provide clients with access to Bitcoin-based investment products.Related: US banks to allow Bitcoin trading in 2021, says NYDIG execsOn the Alkami front, NYDIG is now part of the firm’s Gold Partner Program — a significant step in enabling banks and credit unions to offer BTC buying and custody products to their customers.Commenting on the importance of these collaborations, NYDIG co-founder and CEO Robert Gutmann declared that these partnerships were necessary to make Bitcoin readily accessible via legacy financial institutions.According to Gutmann, such integration efforts will help to ensure the continued expansion of the Bitcoin network."
399,"Major crypto wallet provider Blockchain.com is integrating with Unstoppable Domains to simplify sending crypto funds for its customers.Unstoppable Domains announced Thursday that it had integrated native support for Blockchain.com, enabling that latter's 32 million verified users to send funds with a username instead of a full-length crypto wallet address.The initiative aims to remove the risk of human error when sending funds, simplifying transactions between Blockchain.com users and more than 50 other wallets and exchanges supported by Unstoppable Domains, including Coinbase wallet, MyEtherWallet and others.The integration allows users to send cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) using a readable recipient’s domain instead of a 25-to-42-digit alphanumeric wallet address. This way, users will be protected from associated typos or miscopies.“With our integration with Blockchain.com, an 'invalid address' message will pop up if the address is not linked to a wallet,” Unstoppable Domains founder and CEO Matthew Gould told Cointelegraph.Gould said that there is no specific character length for a domain wallet address. “We only recommend you pick a domain that’s easy to read and remember. It could be your first and last name, your nickname, the name of your business,” he noted.Related: Unstoppable Domains’ .crypto websites now available via Brave browserThe news comes amid Unstoppable Domains hitting a major milestone, with the company selling more than one million domain names that are minted as nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.

400,"Gemini, a major cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, is responding to Bitcoin’s (BTC) environmental issue by purchasing carbon credits. On Thursday, the company announced its long-term initiative to incorporate climate-conscious measures into its business, launching a collaboration with Climate Vault, a nonprofit founded at the University of Chicago.Through the initiative, Gemini plans to purchase carbon credits for nearly 350,000 metric tons of carbon to offset non-renewable energy consumed by Bitcoin miners and help decarbonize Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network.According to the announcement, the partnership will have Gemini purchase carbon permits directly from government-related cap-and-trade markets and erase them from circulation. In doing this, Gemini prevents other market players from using these carbon credits to emit CO2 and thus cuts the overall supply of carbon permits. According to Gemini, the resulting reduction in allowed emissions is equivalent to almost 1 billion miles driven by a passenger car.Gemini will keep working with Climate Vault in an ongoing campaign to cut and ultimately remove the carbon emissions of the Bitcoin that Gemini custodies, the announcement notes. Gemini has also allocated $1 million through the Gemini Opportunity Fund to support sustainability-focused companies and projects as part of its environment-conscious program, Gemini Green.Related: UN sees blockchain technology as tool to fight climate crisis“As Bitcoin emerges as a dominant store of value, it’s imperative that we incorporate sustainability for future generations.

401,"Within the same month, talk of the United States' budding capital of crypto has seemingly shifted its center from Miami to New York City.  June opened with feverish excitement about the largest Bitcoin (BTC) event in history being hosted in Miami, and the city's mayor, Francis Suarez, has taken a series of steps to strengthen his bid to make Miami the top spot for crypto not just nationally but globally.Yet with U.S. pundits now focused on New York City's mayoral race, the current frontrunner for the Democratic nominee, Eric Adams, has — at least momentarily — stolen the limelight from Suarez and his plans. On election night on Tuesday, soon after voting had closed for the primaries, Adams pledged:In a city known for its overwhelmingly Democrat-leaning voting record, successful candidacy as Democratic nominee is viewed by most commentators as a surefire route to becoming the city's actual mayor once elections are held in November later this year. Adams' frontrunner status, moreover, was cemented soon after another candidate, Andrew Yang — himself a staunch crypto advocate — conceded defeat after the first vote count results indicated that his rival was well in the lead. Within hours, Adams had seemingly taken the words out of Yang's mouth — literally.As mayor of NYC - the world’s financial capital - I would invest in making the city a hub for BTC and other cryptocurrencies.Related: Andrew Yang says he'll transform NYC into a Bitcoin hub if elected mayorAdams is a former police officer and was a self-described “conservative Republican” early in his political career. He has successfully tapped big donor funds, positioned himself as tough on crime and aligned himself with the real estate industry, all the while appealing to local unions, parties and churches by pitching his fidelity to “values instilled in him by his single mother when he struggled with hunger and homelessness as a young man.” While progressives have, unsurprisingly, been highly critical of Adams, his strategy also had the effect of ensuring that Yang continued to tack right. Yang's recent political history has been intense, including a rumored shortlisting for the role of commerce secretary in President Joe Biden's cabinet and a high-profile presidential campaign, neither of which ended up positively for his crypto community fans. With Yang now out of the mayoral contest, what may have seemed a blow to the industry may just as quickly have turned out to be a hopeful opportunity."
402,"The Brazil Stock Exchange, or B3, has launched the trading of another Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, marking the growing acceptance of the crypto industry in the country.Brazilian asset manager QR Asset Management started trading its Bitcoin ETF with the ticker QBTC11 on the Sao Paulo-based B3 exchange on Wednesday, Cointelegraph Brasil reported.The listing comes several months after the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission approved QR’s Bitcoin ETF in March alongside another crypto-based ETF by Latin American crypto investment firm Hashdex. In contrast to Hashdex’s crypto ETF product, which offers a diversified portfolio to several cryptocurrencies, QR’s ETF product provides exposure exclusively to Bitcoin.QR Capital founder and CEO Fernando Carvalho said that the acceptance of a crypto ETF is a symbol of security, as it enables investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin directly on the B3 without relying on unregulated platforms:Related: Canadian Bitcoin ETFs quickly hit $1.3B in AUM while US acceptance lagsQR’s Bitcoin ETF is not the only cryptocurrency ETF listed on the B3.

403,"Bitcoin (BTC) erased some of its gains on Thursday in a test of lower levels, which spooked already wary traders.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting local lows of $32,400 on Thursday.The pair had risen to as high as $34,711 on Bitstamp the day before, making a remarkable comeback after falling to six-month lows of $28,600.With resistance still pressuring a fuller recovery, however, caution was noticeable among market participants.“CT is turning bearish again but I think this looks like a correction of the bounce from 28k,” popular trader Crypto Ed summarized in an update.He added that he expected “at least” another push to a local top of $37,000–$38,000, but for this to be likely, Bitcoin needed to bounce at a target zone around $32,000.At the time of writing, BTC/USD was already higher, eyeing $33,500.“BTC is still in the process of retesting the ~$32000 level (black) as support,” analyst Rekt Capital added.Analytics service Whalemap also highlighted $37,000 as a significant resistance hurdle for Bitcoin to overcome thanks to the distribution of whale positions.As Cointelegraph reported, the end of this month is being met with trepidation in the face of a quarterly futures expiry worth some $2.3 billion.This, combined with unlocking events scheduled for July at the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), means that selling pressure can remain for the next several weeks — with a break in the first week of July — before substantially subsiding.Changes in selling pressure from miners, meanwhile, are already visible amid the ongoing shake-up in China, data suggests.On Thursday, on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant eyed Bitcoin’s Puell Multiple hitting lows at which it has historically bounced.A classic indicator, Puell can be used to eye “buy” signals, and it captured the start of the past year’s bull market with precision.“Low Puell Multiple values indicate miner profitability is low compared to yearly averages. This means some miners will reduce hash power, difficulty will reduce allowing further decentralization, and less sell pressure/impact on liquid supply from miners,” CryptoQuant explained."
404,"Numerous governments are attempting to ban cryptocurrencies, with recent examples from China, India, Turkey and Nigeria. The reason for doing so is simple: The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies poses a threat to the legacy financial system, and as the technology itself is still in its infancy, it seems to attract hackers. Even so, banning crypto will not dissuade hackers or scammers in the slightest.Ever since the inception of cryptocurrency, hackers have shown an appetite for this form of money. The perceived appeal of being anonymous when receiving payments has created an aura of invincibility for all cryptocurrencies. However, that is often misunderstood, as none of the public blockchains are private nor anonymous in their current form. While transactions are pseudonymous on the blockchain, users will still need to convert to and from fiat currencies at some point. Those steps often require verifying one's identity through official documents, negating the entire anonymity and privacy aspect.Related: Report on crypto exchange hacks 2011-2020Even though most hackers acknowledge that cryptocurrencies lack both privacy and anonymity, the overall crime rates remain relatively high. Despite a significant decrease in crypto-related crimes in 2020, according to a report from security firm CipherTrace, there are still plenty of concerns. For this reason, many governments want to ban cryptocurrencies, as they expect such measures will deter hackers from doing harm.That outcome seems rather unlikely, though. With tools such as ransomware, malware and other types of criminal activities, it wouldn't take much effort for hackers to change the way they receive payments. Cryptocurrencies offer pseudonymity, but they are not the only payment methods to do so.Gift cards, for example, are a convenient, legal way of transferring value from one person to another. Most convenience stores sell gift cards for various services, including Netflix, iTunes, PaySafeCard and so forth. Every gift card has value and does not require a name to acquire or convert to online money. These cards are, in essence, far more private and anonymous than cryptocurrencies will ever be. However, they are also more accessible, making them a more significant problem to governments looking to dissuade hackers.The same concept applies to prepaid cards for mobile providers. As these cards do not require identity verification to purchase and do not require a check to be activated, they are basically anonymous money. Although prepaid mobile cards aren't necessarily viable across borders, it remains a private way of transferring value from one person to the next.If governments are serious about dissuading hackers, they will also need to find a way to cut them off from the existing financial system. Bank accounts and payment cards can be hacked and abused far too conveniently, even in 2021. Hackers and other criminals can access a bank account through various means, including mobile trojans, fake applications, phishing, keyloggers, man-in-the-middle attacks and so forth. As long as there is a way for hackers to make money without immediate repercussions, they will continue to explore the different options at their disposal.Related: Don’t blame crypto for ransomwareWhile governments strongly believe Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are the main reason for online crime, the reality is often different. According to a recent Chainalysis report, just 0.34% of the crypto market's combined transaction volume pertained to illicit activity in 2020. That is a sharp decrease from the 2% recorded in 2019. If anything, this research by Chainalysis shows fewer and fewer criminals focus on Bitcoin and other crypto assets.Digging a bit deeper, it becomes apparent that ransomware remains the top solution for online crime, and it is a very significant threat and problem. As more people now work from home due to COVID-19 restrictions, there are new opportunities for criminals looking to make a quick buck. That doesn’t automatically mean that cryptocurrencies will be phased out, as the majority of consumers have no idea how this industry works.Related: COVID-19: Decentralization the norm as workplaces adjust to new normalAny government looking to ban cryptocurrencies will not be successful for multiple reasons. First of all, it is impossible to prevent people from using crypto assets, as governments have no control over these networks, nor are there any central figureheads or CEOs to pressure into shutting down activity, making it nearly impossible for governments to act. While regulators can make it difficult for service providers, those companies are not necessarily essential for sustaining cryptocurrencies.Moreover, the numerous options that hackers and scammers have at their disposal to make money should not be ignored. If the goal is to prevent illicit activity, tackling the abuse of traditional finance needs to be the top priority. Cryptocurrencies represent far less of a market for criminals compared with bank-related services and products, as well as gift cards and other forms of pseudonymous money. Addressing cybercrime is a pressing matter as costs spiral further out of control, but the focus should not be on cryptocurrencies.Any attempt to crack down on cryptocurrency “because criminals use it” is bogus. If that truly is the objective, there are different approaches to explore, rather than banning something. Since one cannot use cryptocurrencies without the traditional financial system, it is not hard to see where governments should focus their attention. Unfortunately, none of them seem willing to acknowledge that the system they help maintain is at fault for most criminal activity today.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

405,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) dip below $29,000 on June 22 rocked the markets a handful of analysts to call for a potential drop below $20,000. Many traders on crypto Twitter were focused on the formation of a death cross on the Bitcoin chart as an omen for another potential drop in the price but analysts with a more contrarian point of view look at this chart pattern as a signal that it is time to buy the dip. The ultimate thread on #BTC deathcross and cycle data analysis

1) Historical #deathcross until #goldencross time (in days) + largest price swing since deathcross begins:
2011: 180 D, -59%
2014: 90 D, +83%
2014: 390 D, -63%
2018: 360 D, -55%
2019: 105 D, -29%
2020: 50 D, +66% pic.twitter.com/8JmbtnFLGJThree reasons why some traders still see a bull case for Bitcoin include the appearance of the ""spring” stage of the Wyckoff accumulation model, steady buying by long-term holders and the formation of a bear trap at the golden ratio that is similar to moves seen during previous bull runs.The Wyckoff accumulation model has been all the rage amongst cryptocurrency analysts over the past month as the price action for Bitcoin has been tracking the pattern relatively closely since the May 19 sell-off.Wyckoff Accumulation Model - Spring Test

Seems like a possibility. We just got the lower low at $28.8K ... If this model plays out we will now enter the final phase of the recovery back up. Lets see how it play out. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/stuWJRWWoLAs seen in the tweet above, Bitcoin’s plunge below $29,000 and the subsequent recovery above $32,000 has some analysts suggesting that the “spring test” seen in phase C of the Wyckoff pattern has been fulfilled. This would indicate that the bottom is in for the current correction and now begins the choppy climb higher.If this turns out to be true, BTC would enter phase D, also known as the “markup phase” where a new uptrend is established and ""pullbacks to new support offer buying opportunities” that are often seen as opportunities to buy the dip.Related: Bitcoin drops below $36K as century-old financial model predicts big BTC crashIn phase D a breakout to new highs is expected as the cycle completes and prepares to potentially begin again once the move higher is exhausted.Another bullish sign cited by analysts is the steady accumulation by long-term holders.If you’re scared, just remember what the #Bitcoin long term holders are doing right now. Don't let the vola flush you out, think long term.https://t.co/koCh7pfGf9 pic.twitter.com/bAba8DUWo2The Bitcoin long-term net holder position shows that investors actually began to reaccumulate back in late April and they began to significantly increase their activity in May as the price fell into the $30,000 to $40,000. On-chain data shows that these investors have continued to buy into the most recent dip.This activity suggests that more experienced crypto traders are familiar with Bitcoin's market cycles and view the current range as a good level to open long positions when fear is high and the sentiment is low. The biggest rewards go to those who take the risk to buy an asset amid plunging prices and sentiment, and these are the types of situations where the contrarian traders thriv.The third scenario some analysts are focusing on suggests that the current price movements have set up a bear trap that echoes a move seen during the last cycle which involves a pullback to the 1.618 golden ratio extension level which will then be followed by a breakout to new highs.From this perspective, the market is currently in the awareness phase of the four psychological stages of asset bubbles. After the bear trap occurs, Bitcoin will enter the mania phase where widespread media coverage attracts the attention of new market participants who then chase the price to ever-increasing heights ""based on the delusion that the asset will keep going up, forever.”Previous calls for the possibility of Bitcoin reaching a price of $200,000 by the third or fourth quarter of 2021 by veteran trader Peter Brandt, who was far from alone in predicting its value to surpass the $100,000 mark this year, would suggest that the long-expected blow-off top is yet to come.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

406,"After a brief recovery to $41,000 on June 14, Bitcoin (BTC) investors might have thought that the bear market was finally over. After all, it was the highest level since May 21 and the date that MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced a successful $500 million debt offering. The funds are usually available in one or two business days, and the proceeds would be used to acquire even more Bitcoin for the business intelligence company's balance sheet. MicroStrategy followed this fund-raise with another surprise filing to sell up to $1 billion of its stock to buy even more Bitcoin.However, a 30% drop took place over the following week, causing Bitcoin to reach its lowest level since January 22. The $28,800 bottom might have lasted less than fifteen minutes, but the bear sentiment was already established.The sell-off was largely attributed to Chinese miners' capitulating after they were forced to abruptly shut down their operations. Furthermore, on June 21, an official People's Bank of China (PBoC) reiterated that all banks and payment institutions ""must not provide account opening or registration for [virtual currency]-related activities.""The open question is whether derivatives played a vital part in the correction or at least displayed stress signs that may indicate an even more dangerous second leg down?The futures premium (or basis) measures the gap of longer-term futures contracts to the current spot (regular markets) levels. Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. This situation is also known as backwardation and indicates a bearish sentiment.Futures should trade at a 5% to 15% annualized premium in healthy markets, otherwise known as contango. On the worst moment on June 22, this basis bottomed at 2.5%, which is considered bearish but not enough to trigger any red flag.The top traders' long-to-short indicator is calculated using clients' consolidated positions, including spot, margin, perpetual and futures contracts. This metric gathers a broader view of professional traders' effective net position.Despite the discrepancies between crypto exchange methodologies, analyzing changes over time provides valuable insights. Top traders at Binance, for example, increased their long positions relative to shorts on June 22.At Huobi, there has been some increase in their net short exposure, but nothing out of the ordinary as the indicator reached the same level two days before.Lastly, OKEx top traders reduced their longs on June 20 and have since kept a 0.80 level favoring shorts by 20%.Those unaware of the price swing would never have guessed that Bitcoin traded below $29,000 based on futures liquidations data.Less than $600 million in longs were liquidated on June 22, lower than the previous day's $750 million figure. Had longs been overleveraged, a 20% drop in less than two days would have triggered stop orders of a much greater size.Data show no current signs of stress from longs or a potential negative swing caused by derivatives markets.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

407,"Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $30,000 on June 22, which may be a final sign of capitulation. Data from Skew suggests that if Bitcoin’s price does not recover sharply in the next few days, the decline in the current quarter could be the second-worst quarter since 2014.Bull and bear phases are part and parcel of every asset class. All the legacy markets have witnessed several bear phases with massive drawdowns in the past. However, after the bear phase ends, a new bull market begins and long-term investors are usually rewarded with strong gains. The crypto markets are presently witnessing a similar bear market correction.Every bear market is caused due to events that create fear and panic among market participants. However, unless the long-term fundamentals change, the smart investor should use the corrections to buy. Glassnode data suggests that long-term Bitcoin holders are using the current decline to accumulate Bitcoin.It is impossible to time the bottom because it will be confirmed only in hindsight. Therefore, capitulations to strong support levels during panic selling may be viewed as buying opportunities.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support and resistance levels.The long tail on Bitcoin’s June 22 candlestick shows strong buying in the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone. This was the fourth instance when buyers defended the support zone, hence this becomes an important area to watch out for.The relative strength index (RSI) has formed a bullish divergence, which suggests the sellers may be losing their momentum.If buyers drive the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($36,260), the BTC/USDT pair could spend some more time between the $28,000 and $43,351.67 range. The longer the time spent inside this range, the stronger will be the eventual breakout from it.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that bears are selling on relief rallies. A break below $28,000 may result in panic selling, dragging the price to $20,000.Ether (ETH) broke below the triangle on June 18 and reached the critical support at $1,728.74 on June 22. The bulls purchased this dip and are attempting to stage a relief rally, which may hit a wall at the 20-day EMA ($2,325).If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the ETH/USDT pair below the $1,728.74 support. If they succeed, the pair could start the next leg of the down move that may reach $1,536.92 and then $1,293.18.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone indicate that bears have the upper hand. Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($2,812).Binance Coin (BNB) plunged below the $291.06 support on June 21 but the bears could not break the next support at $211.70. The long tail on the June 22 candlestick indicates strong buying at lower levels.If the bulls push and sustain the price above $291.06, the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the downtrend line. The bears are likely to defend this resistance aggressively.However, the RSI is forming a bullish divergence, suggesting the bearish momentum may be weakening. If the bulls can pierce the downtrend line, the pair could rally to $433.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the downtrend line, the bears will again try to pull the pair below the $211.70 support. If they manage to do that, the pair could slide to $200 and later to $126.75.Cardano (ADA) dropped to the critical support at $1 on June 22 but the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests that bulls are defending this level aggressively. However, repeated retests of a support level weaken it.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($1.44) and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the sellers will again try to break the $1 support.If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could witness long liquidation and a drop to $0.80 and then to $0.68 may be on the cards. Alternatively, if the bulls push the price above the moving averages, the pair may rally to $1.94.XRP dived below the $0.75 to $0.65 support zone on June 20, indicating aggressive selling by traders. The break below the May 23 low at $0.65 has extended the lower highs and lower lows pattern for the coin.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the price turns down from $0.75, it will suggest that bears have flipped this level into resistance. That could pull the price down to $0.40.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls propel and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.80), it will indicate accumulation at lower levels. The XRP/USDT pair could then rally to $1.07. A break above the descending channel will suggest that the downtrend is over.Dogecoin (DOGE) plunged sharply on June 21 and broke below the $0.21 support. The price has rebounded off the $0.16 support but the bulls have an uphill task ahead of them.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.29) and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears have the upper hand. Any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA and then at the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern.If the price turns down from either overhead resistance level, the DOGE/USDT pair could retest the $0.16 support. A breakdown and close below this level could attract further selling and the pair could decline to $0.10.Alternatively, if bulls can drive and sustain the price above the neckline, it will suggest that the bearish setup did not find support at lower levels. That could open the doors for a rally to the 50-day SMA and then to $0.45.The bulls are attempting to stall Polkadot’s (DOT) decline near the May 23 low at $13.63. However, the bulls are unlikely to have it easy as the relief rally could face selling near the 20-day EMA ($21).Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to resume the downtrend.A break below $13 could open the gates for a further fall to the psychological support at $10 and then to $7.50. This negative view will be nullified if the bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA.Uniswap (UNI) declined close to the May 23 low at $13 but the long tail on the June 22 candlestick suggests that bulls are attempting to defend this level. The relief rally could now reach the 20-day EMA ($21.72).The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 39 suggest that bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the sellers will make one more attempt to sink the UNI/USDT pair below the $13 support.If they succeed, the pair could extend the decline to $10 and then to $7. On the contrary, if bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, it will be the first signal that the downtrend could be over.

The altcoin could now rise to the breakdown level at $538.11.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI near the oversold zone indicate that bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from $538.11, the BCH/USDT pair could retest the support at $370.A breakdown and close below this level could clear the path for a fall to $300 and then $270. Alternatively, if bulls propel the price above the 20-day EMA ($585), the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($822). Such a move will suggest that the pair may have hit a bottom.Litecoin (LTC) broke below the May 23 low at $118.03 on June 22. However a minor positive is that the bulls purchased the dip and have pushed the price back above $118.03 today.The LTC/USDT pair could now rise to the downtrend line. If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will attempt to sink and sustain the pair below the $118.03 support. If they manage to do that, the descending triangle pattern will complete.This bearish setup could attract further selling and may result in a further decline to $70. This negative view will be invalidated if the bulls drive the price above the downtrend line. That will indicate strong buying at lower levels and the pair may then rally to the 50-day SMA ($215).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

I held onto it, and my gosh, it’s performed beautifully over the years for me,” she said, adding:Lummis is one of the most vocal advocates of Bitcoin in the U.S. Senate. Earlier this year, she launched the Financial Innovation Caucus to educate fellow lawmakers about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the time, Lummis said she will work with the caucus to address false narratives about cryptocurrencies, including their association with money laundering and other financial crimes.Related: Bitcoin bounce from $28.8K activates century-old financial model's bullish thesisAs Cointelegraph reported, Sen.

At the time of writing, the digital currency was up 5.5% at $33,700."
410,"Cryptocurrency investors all over the globe have been facing a challenging time for over a month thanks, in large part, to the unprecedented price drops that have happened across the board in relation to most prominent digital currencies available in the market.Since the start of June, the total market capitalization of this relatively nascent space has dipped from a little over $1.8 trillion to around $1.3 trillion, thus showcasing a loss of over 40%.One thing interesting to note is that as the market has declined and shown signs of contracting, while Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to display a strong correlation with Ether (ETH) and the wider altcoin market in general. To elaborate on this point, it can be seen that BTC’s correlation with ETH has continued to hover close to the 0.8 mark over the last 30 days.To make better sense of what these numbers represent, it should be highlighted that values ranging between 0 and 0.3 suggest little to no correlation between two assets, while those between 0.3 and 0.5 suggest a low correlation. On the other hand, once the aforementioned metric crosses the 0.5 mark, it becomes a territory of high-value interdependence. For example, values between 0.5 and 0.7 represent moderate correlation, and those above 0.8 denote an extremely high level of monetary association.So, is this correlation bad for the cryptocurrency market and those holding or trading coins? Leo Cheng, co-founder of decentralized lending protocol C.R.E.A.M. Finance, told Cointelegraph that while BTC has always been considered to be the strongest, safest store of value across the global crypto landscape, since April, Ether and a host of other altcoins have gained a lot of value in relation to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. He added:Cheng further noted that in addition to price volatility, various adoption metrics associated with the crypto market, such as the total number of users, network activity, have continued to hit all-time highs. “Builders in crypto haven’t stopped building. Market pullbacks reduce noise and give builders space to innovate,” he said.Similarly, Antoni Trenchev, CEO of digital asset platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph that the latest episode of China’s ongoing love-hate relationship with crypto has made a dent in Bitcoin’s price, only to set a sour pattern for the rest of the market. He added:Lastly, Trenchev is of the view that if inflation rates continue to increase after the record-high month of May, he expects cryptocurrencies to outperform all other asset classes this year, saying, “This could possibly translate into a renewed decline in Bitcoin’s correlation with altcoins, much like the peak of the market earlier this year.”There is no denying that whenever the value of Bitcoin rises radically, the market at large follows. This is because when investors have an optimistic outlook for BTC, the sentiment usually trickles down into other altcoins.That said, it has been proven time and again that the crypto market functions in a manner that is beyond anyone’s wildest imaginations, with things like FUD and short-term volatility playing major roles in dictating the monetary momentum of the sector.Related: Joining the ranks: Bitcoin’s correlation with gold and stocks is growingWinston, the pseudonymous moderator for automatic yield farming protocol Harvest Finance, prefers to look at things through a different lens, claiming that since Bitcoin’s dominance bottomed out on May 18, most major altcoins have just been steadily bleeding. He said:In this regard, Blake Ho, chief operating officer of DeFi platform Furucombo, believes that during periods of such volatility, it is best for investors to take a step back and consider looking at assets other than Bitcoin, Ether, etc. in order to diversify their portfolios. “Allocating some funds to stablecoins for lending yields or some in promising projects for long-term investment can help reduce one’s overall risks,” he opined.Back in Q1 2020, some prominent altcoins showcased BTC correlation values in excess of 0.91, basically suggesting that whenever Bitcoin rose or dipped, so did these digital tokens. This trend, by and large, continued through the entire year, but at the start of 2021, things began to change.For example, all through January and February of this year, this correlation quotient dipped, only to once again cross the 0.8 mark, resulting in a number of altcoins rising in value by a huge margin. It is interesting to point out that ETH (along with many other top altcoins) tends to deliver higher returns during bull runs when compared with BTC. This was made especially evident during the bull market earlier this year when Ether was able to showcase gains of nearly 600% in comparison to Bitcoin’s returns of around 150%.That being said, it will be interesting to see how things shape up from here on out, especially if Bitcoin manages to go on another bull run. And while the altcoin market will definitely get a boost if BTC surges, a pertinent question worth looking at is whether or not some of those larger altcoins will decouple — much like how ETH did when it scaled up to its all-time high of $4,200 — from Bitcoin and forge their own financial identity in the coming months."
411,"A recent upswing in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) following a nail-biting price crash below $30,000 on June 22 has activated a classic financial model's bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency.Called the Wyckoff method — created by Richard Wyckoff in 1888 — the model attempts to navigate financial market trends based on the relationship between the supply and demand of assets. The method has two schematics: accumulation and distribution.In an accumulation setup, an asset signals bottoming out following a sharper price decline. It eventually leads to the price rebounding to the upside. Meanwhile, the distribution setup sees the asset topping out after a solid price move uphill. After that, the price reverses direction to the downside. Each setup has five unique phases. For example, in the distribution phase, an asset goes through the following events across the said phases (in order): preliminary supply (PSY), buying climax (BC), automatic reaction (AR), secondary test, sign of weakness (SOW), last point of supply (LPSY) and upthrust after distribution (UTAD).Meanwhile, in the accumulation schematic, an asset logs the following events across its five phases (in order): preliminary support (PS), selling climax (SC), automatic rally (AR), secondary test (ST), last point of support (LPS), and sign of strength.Comparing the Bitcoin recent price action and the events presented in the Wyckoff accumulation schematic, it appears the cryptocurrency is grappling with its last point of support of Phase C.Phase A in the chart above shows exhaustion in the previous downside momentum at the secondary test (between $28,8,00 and $30,000) and selling climax (approximately $34,000) levels. Up to this point, the supply was dominant as per the Wyckoff method.An automatic rally (AR) approached in phase B, led by both institutional demand for Bitcoin and short-covering. Later, the price repeatedly dipped toward secondary tests and bounced back after testing the selling climax horizontal line from phase A.Now, Bitcoin's price has entered phase C, leaving up it to the ""smart money"" to decide whether the cryptocurrency is ready to go higher. An upside confirmation would come if the ongoing rebound extends above the SC-ST phase, accompanied by stronger volumes.Phase D and phase E reflect an all-and-all recovery run toward $60,000.""Seems like a possibility,"" said market analyst Kevin Swenson. ""We just got the lower low at $28.8K ... If this model plays out, we will now enter the final phase of the recovery back up."" He added:Meanwhile, Bloomberg Intelligence's senior commodity strategist, Mike McGlone, noted — albeit not referring to the Wyckoff method — that repeated bullish rejections near $30,000 are similar to how Bitcoin bounced from $4,000 in 2019 to 2020.""Selling Bitcoin around good support & similar dips below most means as about $30K this year hasn't ended well,"" he added, ""and if the key question this time around is whether it's different, we see a more-enduring bull market.""The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

412,"Bitcoin (BTC) maintained $34,000 support on Wednesday as a rebound from six-month lows showed surprising resilience.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD stabilizing on Wednesday after a day of unnerving volatility.At the time of writing, Bitcoin was approaching $34,500 on the back of daily gains, which topped 15%.While the latest price action did not convince everyone that the bottom was in, it frames the dip to $28,600 as a capitulation event on the back of negative news from China similar to the $30,000 flash crash in May.For Mike McGlone, senior market strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, there was little reason to reassess a long-term bullish view on Bitcoin.He argued that $30,000 was just like $4,000 after the 60% price crash of March 2020 — a “line in the sand.”“Selling Bitcoin around good support & similar dips below most means as about $30K this year hasn’t ended well, and if the key question this time around is whether it’s different, we see a more-enduring bull market,” he explained.Among the more cautious voices, meanwhile, was popular trader Rekt Capital, who on Wednesday was keenly eyeing the potential for Bitcoin to fulfill a negative Wyckoff pattern to exit to the downside.“In sum, if BTC loses this current downtrend wedging structure...

A Bitmain spokesperson said that the company will continue supporting future delivery of devices used to mine smaller altcoins. The representative did not elaborate on when Bitmain expects to resume global spot delivery.Arthur Li, founder of Bitmain-backed mining startup Sai Technology, highlighted massive selling pressure for top-tier Bitmain miners in the secondhand market. Some of the flagship miner devices from Bitmain and rival Whatsminer are now sold at around 150 yuan ($23) for each terahash per second, down from 600 yuan ($93) in April, when Bitcoin hit an all-time high above $64,000.Related: Bitcoin hash rate hits 8-month low as Chinese miners power downA sharp decline in ASIC Bitcoin miner prices comes in line with a major price drop of Nvidia GPUs that are often used for cryptocurrency mining.

414,"The downward trend in Bitcoin’s (BTC) price following its April all-time high might be worrying for first-time investors. Still, CoinShares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors believes that most of the long-time holders are not selling, and this is a correction to weed out panic sellers. Speaking to CNBC, Demirors underscored that Bitcoin is here to stay, and after 200 days of crypto market expansion, it’s normal to have a price drop. “You can’t have a number go up forever,” she added, stating:“Paper hands” is a popular market term to describe an investor who can’t endure high financial risk and starts selling as soon as the asset price begins to drop. It’s the opposite of “diamond hands,” which simply means a pressure-resistant holder.Reminding that the crypto market, excluding Bitcoin, is up 200% for the year, Demirors said that Bitcoin has always been a volatile asset class. “I’m not going anywhere even if we go to $20,000. Last March, we were at $3,000 for Bitcoin,” she said, adding that “we have to keep the context in mind.”She said that many retail investors who didn’t do their research are selling, while long-term holders continue to wait. “If we look at on-chain activity, wallets that have been holding for a long time have actually been using this opportunity to accumulate,” she added.Glassnode data confirms Demirors’ point. According to its data, Bitcoin addresses that do not sell the coins they accumulate have increased their holdings since April’s all-time highs.Related: Bitcoin drops below $30K to 6-month lows: Watch these next price support levelsDemirors said that she expects to see consolidation at the current price level with the uncertainty at the macro scale. “There’s a lot of uncertainty around policies.

417,"China, once home to about 65% of the total Bitcoin (BTC) mining hash power, has given the boot to several miners in the country.The country’s Bitcoin mining ban means miners have been forced to shut down their operations with some establishments already moving hardware overseas.Tweeting on Wednesday, Kevin Zhang, vice president of crypto mining advisory outfit Foundry, said the mood among Chinese miners has grown sour, adding:According to Zhang, China’s Bitcoin ban has caused about 70% of the country’s mining capacity to shut down, and by the end of June, close to 90% will have gone offline.For some miners, the ban goes beyond shuttering operations, as power stations in certain areas in the Sichuan Province have served eviction notices to Bitcoin miners. Affected miners reportedly have no more than a fortnight to uninstall all of their operating infrastructures including racks and containers.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, some major Bitcoin miners have already begun to set up shop in other countries.

419,"Bitcoin (BTC) is “very close to the bottom” and still commands a bullish long-term view, institutional crypto firm Stack Funds believes.In its latest report issued on Wednesday, analyst Lennard Neo said that despite the price meltdown, there was no reason to flip bearish in BTC.The report came the day after BTC/USD plummeted below $30,000 for the first time in six months, only to rebound to current levels above $34,000.Volatility came thanks to a mining shake-up, which, it now appears, will see hashing power transfer en masse from China to other countries.“Bitcoin, too, closed lower, diving down 28% after failing to break $42,000 late last week. The digital asset has since regained some ground after a short squeeze in prices yesterday and is currently trading around the $34,000 handle,” Stack summarized.Neo highlighted an important date coming up in the short term: the Q2 options expiry in the last week of June. Worth $2.3 billion, this should allow for price consolidation once processed.Options expiry events can pressure Bitcoin beforehand, but as Cointelegraph noted, not every expiry ends up moving the market once it takes place.“Intensifying the uncertainty is $2.3b end of quarter Bitcoin options, which is set to expire this Friday — partially attributing to the added volatility in the markets,” he added.Traders may welcome any chance to take stock after the week’s events. In the past 24 hours alone, over $1 billion in positions was liquidated by rapid price moves.That said, the week prior saw much fewer liquidations of long positions, something Stack attributes to a more “cautious” mood among market participants.Related: Bitcoin heading for worst quarter since start of 2018 bear marketAgainst the backdrop of major players such as MicroStrategy stepping in to hoover up the supply at $30,000, there is little left to fuel the skeptics’ views of an apocalyptic market correction.“Putting all these factors together, we believe Bitcoin is very close to the bottom, at least in this current wave,” Neo concluded.July will also see major funds releases for investors in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). After this event, which some argue is adding to selling pressure for Bitcoin, the desire to sell should more or less have drained from the market.Nonetheless, not everyone is convinced that the $28,600 floor seen on Tuesday will be the last of Bitcoin’s bearish turns."

421,"The Pennsylvania-based Stronghold Digital Mining has announced the completion of two private equity securities raises worth $105 million.According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the firm’s first power generation facility, the Scrubgrass Generation Plant in Venango County, converts waste coal into energy on a scale equivalent to “a large-scale hydropower plant” that is then used to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The waste coal recycled by Stronghold was produced by coal mining operations in the 19th and 20th century. Stronghold's power generation processes allow it to rehabilitate large areas of land that were devastated as a result by waste coal acid drainage (AMD).AMD describes a process in which rain or snow mixes with the sulfur in coal waste, allowing it to run into water systems and threaten aquatic life. After removing the waste coal, Stronghold also plans to donate the restored land back to local communities.The company estimates that for every Bitcoin it mines, 200 tonnes of waste coal is destroyed.“Coal waste fires have been wreaking havoc in my home state of Pennsylvania for the last hundred years,” said Stronghold co-chairman, Bill Spence, adding:Working in partnership with local environmental authorities, Stronghold has already reclaimed 1,000 acres of Pennsylvania land it describes as being “once-unusable.” In addition to removing more than 98% of mercury, NOx, and SO2 emissions, the firm’s production process creates fly ash — which is can be used as a fertilizer.Stronghold hopes to have more than 28,000 cryptocurrency miners operational by 2022, and is in discussions to acquire facilities representing more than 200 megawatts of electricity generation capacity.The raise comes as the Bitcoin community is becoming increasingly environmentally conscious, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously reversing course on the electric vehicle manufacturer’s decision to accept payments in Bitcoin, citing the environmental toll of coal-powered mining.Earlier this month, Musk indicated Tesla would explore resuming support for BTC should the mining sector shift to being at least 50% powered by clean energy.Related: China’s crackdown means Bitcoin is working, says crypto minerThe controversy over the ecological footprint of Bitcoin’s creation has contributed to a heavy bear trend for publicly-listed North American mining stocks in recent months, which have experienced draw-downs of between roughly 50% and 60% since posting all-time highs.Despite the broader crypto bearish trend showing few signs of slowing down, independent investment bank, Compass Point, has given Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) a buy rating — noting the firms are generating BTC at discounts of 62% and 70% compared to spot prices respectively."

While Bitcoin has been under increasing pressure from multiple sources since early May, the most recent bout of selling has been largely attributed to capitulation by China-based miners who have been forced to abruptly shut down their operations.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that after dropping to $28,800, Bitcoin price bounced back above the $30,000 level and currently trades for $32,600.The strong bounce came after comments from Brian Nelson, the current nominee for Under Secretary of the Department of the Treasury’s division on terrorism and financial crimes. Nelson said he was going to make the implementation of new regulations around cryptocurrency a priority if he is confirmed.The pressures put on Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market was highlighted by Élie Le Rest, partner at digital asset management firm ExoAlpha. Le Rest told Cointelegraph that “Chinese market participants have been massively selling during the past month.”Le Rest also pointed to the “Grayscale unlocking schedule leading to more selling pressure,” resulting in some panic selling by the less experienced traders in the market.Le Rest said,Due to these pressures, Le Rest believes that the market could range in the “lower tranches of $25,000 to $35,000” in July, with the low volume usually seen in August having the potential to “accelerate this downside trend or build the upside trend.”The upside case for today's move was provided by David Lifchitz, managing partner and chief investment officer of ExoAlpha, who stated that the activity seen in the market on June 22 “seems to have drawn the line in the sand for BTC at $29,000 and Ether (ETH) at $1,700, given the swift bounce.”Related: Bad call? Bitfinex bears closed a block of Bitcoin shorts before the drop below $32KThat being said, Lifchitz warns against throwing caution to the wind as the volatile nature of the crypto market makes picking a bottom notoriously challenging.Lifchitz said:The altcoin market followed Bitcoin’s lead on June 22 with a majority of tokens seeing double-digit losses as traders ran for the safety of stablecoins.The price of Ether managed to rebound along with the price of BTC, helping erase a 15% correction and send the price back above $1,900.Two tokens that managed to rise above the market turmoil and see positive gains for the day were Livepeer (LPT), which posted a 15% gain and Celo (CELO), which saw its price increase by 9%.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.303 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 47.1%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

423,"Bitcoin price is still in a rut, trading near $33,000 and trapped in a downtrend that just seems to get worse with the passing of each day. As the price slumps, analysts have consulted with several technical and on-chain metrics to explain the price collapse, but none of these have picked up on the exact reason. One area of interest has been the sharp rise in short positions at Bitfinex in the past week. Traders are placing exaggerated importance on these Bitcoin (BTC) margin shorts as if they are predictors of the current market crash. Still, as Cointelegraph previously reported, analysts forget that Bitcoin margin longs are usually much larger.As #Bitcoin is Bleeding slowly towards the range low (30-32K) we can see that Bitfinex Mega shorts are getting closed gradually
Still big shorts are open, but half of them are already closed
Keeping an eye on this cuz Finex whale was a key player in 19th of May crash$BTC pic.twitter.com/c4qeb6Nxe3On June 18, longs outnumbered Bitfinex shorts by at least 22,800 BTC, but 87% of the short positions were closed before June 22. Currently, margin longs are 43,850 BTC higher than the amount shorted.While those shorts are usually savvy traders, it is unlikely that they knew in advance that Chinese banks would prevent their clients from engaging in activities involving crypto trading or mining.More importantly, these bearish positions were built while MicroStrategy was buying $500 million in Bitcoin after a successful senior secured note private offer. To make things worse, Michael Saylor's business intelligence firm announced the intention to raise another $1 billion by selling stocks to buy Bitcoin.Let's take a look at how these courageous shorts fared.On June 6, shorts increased from 1,380 to 6,700 at an average price of $36,150. Three days later, another 12,180 shorts were added when Bitcoin was trading at $37,050. Lastly, between June 14 and 15, shorts increased 6,000 to a 25,000 peak while Bitcoin averaged $40,100.By looking at the Bitcoin prices when those short position increases took place, it is reasonable to assume that the 23,500 contract increase (green circles) had an average price of $37,625.Related: Traders search for bearish signals after Bitcoin futures enter backwardationThese short positions were steadily closed over the past three days when Bitcoin was already trading below $37,000. However, 17,000 short contracts had already been closed by the time the price plunged below $33,500. Therefore, it is implausible that the average price was below $34,500.No one would complain about gaining 8%, shorting the market to generate a $73 million profit. However, it is essential to note that on June 16, when Bitcoin reached $40,400, these shorts were underwater by $65 million.This analysis shows how even highly professional traders can go deep underwater. There's no way to know if this trade would have been profitable had the crackdown on China not aggravated Bitcoin price or if MicroStrategy managed to raise the $1 billion before the price drop.If anyone still believes in market manipulation, at least there's comfort in knowing that pro traders can face drastic losses as well. However, unlike us mortals, whales have deep pockets and patience to withhold even the most rigorous thunderstorms.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

424,"Cryptocurrency investors awoke to another round of price declines on June 22 after the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to a 6-month low at $28,805. The dip below the crucial $30,000 level might appear to be a prime buying opportunity but data shows that institutional investors are continuing their longest selling streak since February 2018.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows the June 21 dip below $32,000 and recovery above $33,000 was just a precursor to Tuesday’s move which saw BTC hammered at the start of the trading day, reaching a low of $28,805 before bouncing back to $32,000 at the time of writing.Ether (ETH)  also took a hit, dropping by 15% to a low of $1,700 after bulls failed to hold the $1,900 level. Unless a significant source of momentum emerges to help the market stage a turnaround, the current trend continues to be negative as evidenced by bears dominating Bitcoin’s $2.5 billion options expiry on June 25.While the price action on June 21 may have come as a surprise to many, numerous indicators hinted at the decreasing momentum and possibility of the price dropping further.According to data from Glassnode, the number of active addresses on both Bitcoin and Ethereum have declined significantly from their highs in May, with active BTC addresses falling by 24% while active Ethereum addresses fell by 30%.The drop in activity on the networks has led to an even more dramatic decline in the USD value settled on-chain, with the amount settled falling by 63% to $18.3 billion per day on Bitcoin and by 68% to $5 billion per day on Ethereum.Declines in activity and value transacted on the networks can be interpreted as a drop in enthusiasm in general as investors who bought at the highs in April and May must now decide if they want to sell at a loss to avoid further the potential for further downside or hold with the hope that the market will eventually turn around.Another major source of the market downturn which has been building for weeks is China’s crackdown on cryptocurrency mining operations in the country. This has led to a substantial drop in the record hashrate to levels last seen in September 2020.While the closing of a large number of Chinese mining farms and the resulting decline in hashrate is a negative development in the short term, Delphi Digital has taken the stance that “in the mid to long term, this should be viewed as healthy for the Bitcoin network as hash rate concentration risk is significantly reduced.”According to Delphi Digital, the hash rate concentration in Chinese-based mining pools has been declining since China began its crackdown on mining, allowing smaller pools to grow “their share from 30.81% to 37.96% over the last 30 days.”In addition to the clampdown on mining, China has also reiterated that banks should not be supporting crypto-focused over-the-counter businesses, which led to “panic among Chinese miners and investors,"" leading to a significant decline in the supply of BTC held in miner addresses.With China unlikely to change its current course of action regarding cryptocurrencies anytime soon, investor uncertainty and choppy price action are likely to continue in the short term.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

425,"Amid Bitcoin's (BTC) drop to six-month lows below $30,000 on Tuesday, a Norwegian financial regulator warned investors that the cryptocurrency industry is largely unregulated in the country.The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway, or Finanstilsynet, published June 22 a statement on consumer protection of crypto investors, emphasizing that the authority currently does not supervise local crypto companies in terms of anything but money laundering:Finanstilsynet further pointed out major crypto trading-associated risks like extreme price volatility and scam vulnerabilities. The authority noted that the formation of crypto prices is “not transparent in many cases.”The agency went on to say that there is a strong need for a legal framework and investor protection “if cryptocurrency is to become a suitable form of investment for consumers.” Finanstilsynet mentioned that the European Commission introduced a proposal for crypto market regulations last September, expecting to adopt rules on investor protection, market abuse and issuer authorization within five years.Related: Norwegian authorities urge crypto users to declare earnings on upcoming return“Until such regulations are in place, anyone considering trading in cryptocurrency should think carefully and understand the significant risk that such investments entail. Consumers who want to try this should not invest more than they can afford to lose,” Finanstilsynet concluded.Norway is known as the world’s most cashless country with only 4% of the country’s payments conducted with banknotes and coins. In response to a massive decline in cash usage, the Norwegian central bank initiated research of a central bank digital currency in April 2021."
426,"Powers On... is a monthly opinion column from Marc Powers, who spent much of his 40-year legal career working with complex securities-related cases in the United States after a stint with the SEC. He is now an adjunct professor at Florida International University College of Law, where he teaches a course on “Blockchain, Crypto and Regulatory Considerations.”While attending the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami two weeks ago, several things struck me as interesting and significant. While many others have already reported on the conference, my focus will be on a handful of comments or events that I believe are important for the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.First, the conference was full of churchlike believers, or those curious about crypto and Bitcoin (BTC). Miami Mayor Francis Suarez kicked off the festivities in grand fashion, noting that Miami was the first United States city to place the 2008 Bitcoin white paper on its government’s website. As a transplanted New Yorker who now calls Miami home and teaches blockchain law to law students there, this made me proud.When the emcee asked how many in the audience had been to this particular Bitcoin conference in prior years, many hands of the 12,000-strong crowd went up. These attendees were long-term holders, developers, investors and entrepreneurs. And they had a strong Libertarian slant, as evidenced in the warmly received keynote speech by Ron Paul, a former senator from Texas, who said that “authoritarians” were running our government and the Federal Reserve and taking our liberties and rights away. Wow! I did not realize Paul had become so radicalized, or had already been so.MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said that Bitcoin is the life force of the world. Draper Fisher Jurvetson founder Tim Draper commented that Bitcoin represented “freedom and trust.” I love the Winklevosses, who used the metaphor that “Bitcoin is software to gold’s hardware,” and delighted the crowd by proclaiming that the U.S. dollar is the “biggest shitcoin of them all.” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey rationalized that the “internet needs a native currency.”Noteworthy, too, is who was not in attendance: the “suits” and “nonbelievers,” so to speak. The financial intermediaries, capitalists and their minions who will be marginalized or eliminated were the true promise and primary purpose of blockchain realized, according to Satoshi Nakamoto. Those absent included the traditional commercial and merchant banks, the venture capital and private equity firms, the traditional investment banks and hedge funds, and the companies and professionals such as law firms and accounting firms helping them play catch up — or helping them figure out a way to “own” the blockchain and thus the consumers and public, through permissioned blockchains.For me, I found this quite refreshing. It felt like the exciting programs I attended in 2018, during a time when these same absent players were calling Bitcoin a hoax or fraud, and were gleeful at its price collapse that year. While not all those from 2018 understood what the rules of the road might be to create mass adoption, or the best path, there was sincerity, grand camaraderie and a passion for the efforts and speakers — understanding that there is a large unbanked part of the world that could benefit economically and politically from this untethered financial system BTC can create. They were those who realized rampant inflation was insidiously and stealthily devaluing the assets of citizens. As the co-founder and CEO of Paxos, Charles Cascarilla, said at Bitcoin 2021, Bitcoin is not just a good idea but a legitimate idea for an alternative financial system.Also interesting to me is the lack of discussion today about the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies as an investment both at the conference and elsewhere. Back in the day, I remember sitting on a panel advocating for blockchain and crypto, with a fellow panelist, an ex-Goldman dude, dismissing crypto by saying he would only accept equity or notes for any investment in a blockchain startup.Remember when the nonbelievers and others praying for BTC’s demise noted that owning a cryptocurrency was fools’ play, as the coin did not provide you as an investor with shareholder-like dividend rights, rights to any profits of the startup or ecosystem, or governance rights? It is astounding how that concern has almost evaporated from conversations about crypto, now that there is a market capitalization of around $1.2 trillion and the trading of cryptocurrency futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange parent company Intercontinental Exchange. Maybe DeFi gets some of the credit for that, as it allows investors to earn “interest” by loaning and staking their coins, and some credit also goes to the growing popularity of proof-of-stake, rather than proof-of-work.However, the showstopper was not Tony Hawk, nor the woman who appeared to be screaming at Dorsey from the first row about Twitter’s privacy policies. It was the young president of the Republic of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, who hails from the most densely populated country in Central America. He appeared via a video broadcast toward the end of the conference. Since 2001, El Salvador has abandoned its own fiat currency, the colón, and adopted the U.S. dollar as its official currency.At the conference, Bukele announced that the country would adopt Bitcoin as a second native fiat currency, on par with the U.S. dollar. A few days later, the legislature there passed a new law doing just that. In Miami, he explained that this adoption “will generate jobs and will help provide financial inclusion to thousands outside the formal economy.” (It is reported that about 70% of the adult population in El Salvador does not have a bank account or credit card.)The law reportedly requires, not just allows, all merchants to accept BTC for goods and services in commercial transactions, with an exception only for those businesses that lack the technology to do so. It also eliminates any capital gains tax on the exchange of BTC for transactions, to provide more stability to the digital asset. Finally, a development bank will be created to hold $150 million in BTC in order to allow merchants the ability to instantly convert BTC to U.S. dollars. Double wow!Related: Adopting the Bitcoin standard? El Salvador writes itself into history booksToday, we have many countries and municipalities experimenting with use cases for blockchain outside of the financial promise, including for supply chain providence and recording of real estate transactions. Examples include Sweden, the country of Georgia, the United Arab Emirates — and with the help of the International Monetary Fund, others include Bolivia, Peru and Argentina. But no country has ever put assets developed by computer code on par with the U.S. dollar!It will be interesting to see how the rest of the sovereign states react to this. I am already reading about studies from economists claiming that El Salvador’s economy will collapse from this legislation. And the IMF is posturing. Let’s see which country will be next to do the same. I predict there will be many in the next few years, allowing for this dual system to coexist in these countries. It is something I have been predicting would occur since 2018.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

427,"Bitcoin (BTC) plunged 7.38% to hit a five-month low of $29,313 on June 22 as the market faced the prospect of another sell-off, this time led by miners affected by a recent crackdown against cryptocurrency entities in China.The People's Bank of China said on June 21 that it had summoned multiple regional institutions — including the Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Jack Ma's payment platform, Alipay — to “strictly implement” its recent ordinances on curbing Bitcoin- and other cryptocurrency-related activities, including mining.The Sichuan province, a hydropower-rich region in Southwest China, ordered its 26 largest crypto mining farms to stop operating, Chinese media reported on June 18. The province had been contributing 75% of the total global hashing power required to run the Bitcoin blockchain network.The regulatory warnings followed a decline in the Bitcoin market, which in mid-April traded near $65,000, spurred by backings from high-profile advocates including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.A recent report published by Glassnode reveals a ""seismic mining shift"" taking place in China. The data analytics platform noted that many miners are in the process of either shutting down or migrating their hashing power outside of China to comply with the mining ban.""One of the largest migrations of Bitcoin hash-power in history appears to be underway,"" wrote Glassnode, adding that the estimated mean hash rate (the seven-day moving average) has declined from circa 155 exahashes per second to around 125 EH/s in the two weeks since the latest round of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) from China.Glassnode anticipated that the Chinese mining industry would likely liquidate a portion of its Bitcoin holdings when coming to grips with relocating farms abroad or selling hardware. Those sell-offs might reflect ""miners hedging risk"" and ""obtaining capital to facilitate and fund logistics.""Meanwhile, for some miners, it may be a general exit from the industry entirely, the report adds.Recent on-chain trends have shown a spike in miners' BTC distribution and a decline in accumulation.For example, the miner net position change metric, which tracks the transactional flow of Bitcoin mining pools, showed miners distributing BTC at a rate of $4,000 to $5,000 per month over the period in which the hash rate fell 16%.""This has reversed the trend of net accumulation which was active since April,"" the report states.Miner capitulation is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as the market absorbs the selling pressure. During the first quarter of 2021, bids for BTC/USD rose from as low as $28,700 to $61,788 even as miners sold their Bitcoin holdings en masse.Jonathan Ovadia, chief executive of OVEX — a South Africa-based cryptocurrency exchange — credited institutional investors as being behind the latest sell-off absorption, drawing evidence from MicroStrategy's ongoing Bitcoin accumulation spree. He said:Meanwhile, taking a look at over-the-counter (OTC) desks, which miners utilize to match their large size distributions with institutional buyers, also showed demand among large volume buyers.""During both the May Sell-off and over the last two weeks, between 3.0k and 3.5k BTC in net inflows have been observed,"" Glassnode reported. ""However in both instances, almost the full inflow size was absorbed by buyers over just a few weeks.""As a result, OTC Bitcoin balances have been relatively flat since April."
428,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell under $30,000 on Tuesday as the latest BTC price dip took the largest cryptocurrency below a significant “line in the sand.”Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD crashing through $30,000 support, shedding 6% in an hour and hitting its lowest levels since late January.After dropping from $41,000 a week ago, Bitcoin has seen multiple rapid bursts of downward volatility in recent days, culminating in Tuesday’s $30,000 breach. As Cointelegraph reported, the breakdown was widely anticipated by traders, some of whom were already calling for $25,000 and even lower.China and the associated media attention surrounding its mining purge appeared to be the main driver of bearishness despite widespread arguments that the shake-up would actually benefit Bitcoin in the long term. “How is more Bitcoin mining power moving to the and the West a bad thing?” David Marcus, head of Facebook’s F2 project, queried on Monday. At the time of writing, BTC/USD traded at around $29,000 amid heavy volatility, bouncing at $29,600 on Bitstamp.Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, reportedly began experiencing technical problems as the price action unfolded.Binance orderbook data showed buyers lined up at $25,000, with events taking out the $30,000 positions visible in the latest representation from monitoring resource Material Indicators."
429,"Amid ongoing concerns over Bitcoin’s carbon footprint, the United Nations has said that cryptocurrency’s underlying technology has massive potential for fixing global issues such as climate change.The U.N. will keep exploring the uses of blockchain technology as a way to fight the climate crisis and help reach a more sustainable global economy, according to an article published on the official U.N. website on Sunday.U.N. experts are confident that “cryptocurrencies and the technology that powers them can play an important role in sustainable development, and actually improving our stewardship of the environment.” Specifically, the article points out a number of environmental and sustainability benefits associated with blockchain, including its power to enable transparency and resistance to fraud, climate finance and clean energy markets.Citing the U.N. Environment Programme’s partnership with the Technical University of Denmark, the article states that data on harmful greenhouse gas emissions is unreliable and incomplete in many countries. In providing an immutable record of carbon data, blockchain solutions can provide a transparent way for nations to take action to reduce their impact on the climate.Blockchain technology can also be an important part of driving renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power by providing a tool to create clean energy markets. “As these sources are, by their nature, intermittent and decentralized, new forms of energy markets are needed,” the article notes.The U.N. emphasized that cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy, and there are still many technological and political challenges to overcome, including environmental issues as well as volatility:Related: Banking system consumes two times more energy than Bitcoin: ResearchMinang Acharya, one of the authors of UNEP’s brief on blockchain applications, urged that the U.N. should continue experimenting with blockchain to learn more about its environmental-friendly implications. “This is likely to improve our UN-wide knowledge on blockchain, our understanding of the environmental and social implications of mining operations, and improve our chances of coping with any problems the technology may bring in the future,” Acharya said."
430,"BTC.com — a major crypto mining pool that is operated by BIT Mining and owned by the NYSE-listed Chinese lottery service provider 500.com — has announced the successful relocation of its first batch of mining machines to Kazakhstan. BTC.com was founded by Jihan Wu and was operated by Bitmain and Bitdeer until its acquisition by 500.com this February. As of the time of writing, the pool is the world’s fifth-largest, validating 10.4% of blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. The relocation comes after the company was notified by the state grid in western Sichuan province that the power supply serving one of its local data centers would be suspended imminently. In its announcement yesterday, BIT Mining stated:The intervention from the state grid comes amid an ongoing crackdown on crypto mining by the Chinese state due to concerns over the mining industry’s carbon footprint, which runs counter to China’s decarbonization targets.In areas such as Inner Mongolia, once popular with crypto miners, regional authorities have even established a dedicated hotline for the local public to directly report any suspected illicit mining activities. Amid these pressures, at least three mining firms — BTC.TOP, Huobi and HashCow — have recently been driven to cease their activities on the mainland. BIT Mining CEO Xianfeng Yang has gestured towards this backdrop, claiming that the company is “committed to protecting the environment and lowering our carbon footprint. We have been strategically expanding our operations overseas as part of our growth strategy. Following our investments in cryptocurrency mining data centers in Texas and Kazakhstan, we are accelerating our overseas development for alternative high-quality mining resources.”Related: Bitcoin mining in China set for 'stricter supervision' due to carbon concernsWhile China has been an early mover against crypto miners, authorities elsewhere are increasingly signaling their concerns about power-guzzling mining sites — for the most part, less on climate grounds than for their impact on local energy provision. In late April, a former government official argued that crypto mining was a major driver of the energy crisis in Kyrgyzstan. Similar concerns have been voiced in the Caucasus and Iran. In line with China, global regulators and nonprofits, Elon Musk this year made a notorious intervention when he announced Tesla would no longer be accepting BTC as payment for vehicles due to concerns about the high energy consumption of Bitcoin (BTC) mining. "
431,"China’s crackdown on Bitcoin (BTC) mining and cryptocurrency trading recently became a primary driver for the red candlesticks on crypto market charts. But one Bitcoin mining engineer believes China’s ban on crypto is “fantastic news.”Brandon Arvanaghi, a former security engineer at crypto exchange Gemini, compared China’s harsh stance against Bitcoin with the country’s ban on Facebook and Google.Arvanaghi called getting banned in China a rite of passage for free technology and stressed that the crackdown means that Bitcoin is working, not that it’s failing. “It’s making nations shiver in their boots,” he added.He said that nations are now picking sides, with China responding to Bitcoin much as it did to major Western tech firms, which is incredibly bullish for Bitcoin for the long and medium-term. Miners are currently flowing out of China — where a phone call is enough to shut down an entire mining plant — and into the United States.“Bitcoin is the greatest store of value in the history of planet Earth; nothing is even comparable,” Arvanaghi said, adding:Related: Banks fall in line as China’s central bank cracks down on crypto accountsArvanaghi also compared Bitcoin’s journey to a video game. In this trope, market-crashing news like drops in the hash rate or geopolitical tensions are bosses along the way “to the inevitable state of Bitcoin becoming universally identified as the greatest store of value we have ever seen.”In the meantime, miners are going to look for cheap electricity around the world, and Texas will be a potential address, Arvanaghi predicted recently. “We have governors like Greg Abbott in Texas who are promoting mining. It is going to become a real industry in the United States, which is going to be incredible,” he added."
432,"United States investment management firm VanEck has filed for a new Bitcoin (BTC) futures mutual fund with the Securities and Exchange Commission.According to a prospectus filed Monday, the new “Bitcoin Strategy Fund” will invest in Bitcoin futures contracts as well as pooled investment vehicles and exchange-traded products that provide exposure to Bitcoin. The fund will not invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies directly.The fund will have exposure to certain Bitcoin futures through its fully owned subsidiary operating in the Cayman Islands. “The subsidiary has the same investment objective as the fund and will follow the same general investment policies and restrictions, except that unlike the fund, it may invest without limit in Bitcoin futures,” the prospectus notes.The fund’s portfolio will be managed by Gregory Krenzer, deputy portfolio manager for the VanEck Commodity Index Strategy and head of active trading with extensive experience in commodities, natural resource equities and emerging markets. Krenzer has been with the Van Eck Associates Corporation since 1994 and has over 25 years of experience in the international and financial markets.Related: SEC warns of Bitcoin futures risks in mutual fundsThe latest filing comes just a few days after the SEC delayed approval of VanEck’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), VanEck Bitcoin Trust, for the second time this year. The SEC is seeking additional public comments, extending the review period by 45 days.Since Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss first attempted to get SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF back in 2017, the securities regulator has rejected numerous efforts to launch such a product and has yet to approve a BTC ETF. Meanwhile, other countries like Canada have been moving forward with Bitcoin ETFs, with 3iQ and CoinShares’ Bitcoin ETF going live on the Toronto Stock Exchange in April 2020."
433,"Bitcoin (BTC) is “confirming” a bear market because whales are still sending large amounts of BTC to exchanges.That’s according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant, who on Monday warned over the “very uncertain” current state of Bitcoin. Uploading a chart of the so-called “Whale Capitulation Index,” Ki identified the first major spate of whale selling on exchanges since July 2019. At that time, BTC/USD had just come off a run to $13,900 — a level it would not reach again until October 2020.As such, given this historical context, Ki joined the voices arguing that the recent $64,500 all-time high for Bitcoin could well have been a local top.“I hate to say this, but it seems like the $BTC bear market confirmed,” he wrote in comments.The data caught the attention of statistician Willy Woo, who this week noted that hodlers were once more adding to their positions, dredging up the supply at price levels just above $30,000.A request for data on whales’ behavior during 2017 yielded a chart showing three distinct episodes of coins being sent to exchanges en masse. This, as the Twitter user who provided it highlighted, did not stop BTC/USD from hitting its then all-time high of $20,000 by the end of the year. Continuing, Ki himself acknowledged that it may not pay to stay bearish on Bitcoin beyond the short term.“To be clear, I expect my $BTC bearish bias won’t last long (maybe just a few weeks) because the market looks good in terms of supply/demand in the long term (e.g., Stablecoins ratio(USD) and SSR),” he added.As Cointelegraph reported, a host of factors appears to be contributing to downward price pressure on Bitcoin.Related: Classic bearish chart pattern forms for Bitcoin as BTC price tumbles to $32KMost notable of all is arguably the seismic shift among miners after China launched a crackdown that has halted activities in some of what were previously the most intensive mining regions worldwide.Commentators have called the event, which is already seeing hashing power transfer to other countries, as the biggest “attack” that the network has ever witnessed.The network hash rate has declined considerably, but not by more than 40% from its all-time highs, while price action has retained $30,000 support.CryptoQuant eyed a corresponding drop in Bitcoin’s Puell Multiple, a classic indicator that now puts the largest cryptocurrency closer to “buy” territory."
434,"The highly anticipated Nasdaq debut of renewable energy-focused BTC mining firm, Bitfarms (BITF), saw the company’s stock fall by as much as 8.6% amid weakness in the broader crypto markets.BITF opened at $4.04 and quickly climbed a couple of percent to tag a high of $4.11 before dropping as low as $3.90 as cryptocurrency prices tumbled. Bitfarm’s shares last traded hands for $3.96.The share prices of publicly-listed Bitcoin mining firms have taken a beating over recent months.Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is down roughly 51% from its early-April all-time high of $56.50 after its stock last changed hands for $27.83, while Hive Blockchain (HIVE) trading at $2.38 for a loss of 57% from its February high of $5.50, and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) priced at $31.57 after falling nearly 60% from its February peak of $77.90.In addition to the heavy BTC sell-off that followed Bitcoin’s April all-time high, the poor performance of mining stocks has resulted from negative perceptions concerning the sector’s energy consumption, and reactions to China’s escalating crackdown on domestic miners.However, Bitfarms claims to have benefited from the recent hash rate exodus from China amid the clampdown, with the Canada-based firm estimating 99% of its computation is powered by “green” hydroelectricity. In its June 10 production update, Bitfarms company stated:Related: Nvidia GPU prices in China fall amid crypto mining crackdownDespite the heavy drawdowns recently observed in the price of mining stocks, Cointelegraph reported in March that the sector had outperformed the spot price of Bitcoin by 455% during the preceding 12 months."
435,"El Salvador’s grand plans to promote Bitcoin adoption could be turned on their head if President Bukele’s Bitcoin Law is proven to be unconstitutional in the country’s courts.A group of citizens joining forces with political party, Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), has filed a lawsuit claiming President Bukele’s Bitcoin adoption program is unconstitutional.FMLN legislator, Jaime Guevara, led the move along with citizens including plaintiff Óscar Artero, who characterize the country’s Bitcoin Law as “lacking in legality, foundation, and did not consider the significance and harmful effects that such a law will cause to the country,” according to a rough translation from local media outlet El Mundo.Guevara stated the complaint will test the newly appointed magistrates of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice.The FMLN came third in February’s legislative election with nearly 7% of the vote, while Bukele’s New Ideas established a dominant lead with two-thirds of votes. Second-placed Nationalist Republican Alliance secured nearly 8%.Salvadorian lawyer, Enrique Anaya, commented that the Presidential House was not clear on how to implement the Bitcoin Law, which was approved on June 9, and suspects that the lawmakers may have even initiated the lawsuit internally.Guevara stated it is “widely rumored” the Bitcoin Law advances the agenda of President Nayib Bukele and his New Ideas (Nuevas Ideas) Party at the expense of the public interest, stating, describing the lawsuit as “simply representing the people”.A survey of 1,600 individuals conducted by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of El Salvador between June 11 and 15 indicated that more than eight out of ten Salvadorans would not agree to receive payments and salaries in Bitcoin. On June 16, El Salvador’s Minister of Labor and Social Welfare, Rolando Castro, said the country is not yet ready to adopt Bitcoin for salary payments.Related: Steve Hanke warns BTC could ‘completely collapse the economy’ of El SalvadorThe Bitcoin adoption plan has already experienced pushback from the World Bank, which refused to assist the country in its transition, citing “the environmental and transparency shortcomings” associated with the digital asset.As reported by Cointelegraph, even if the Bitcoin Law remains in place, there are still many hurdles to mainstream adoption by an entire nation due to its scaling limitations.At the time of writing, Bitcoin prices had slumped 7% over the past 24 hours to trade at $32,800."
436,"The growth of stablecoin's market cap and circulating supply has been one of the best indicators for attaining a general pulse on how participants in the market are feeling during bullish and bearish times.Monitoring the Tether (USDT) treasury for large issuances was a common tactic used by analysts and traders to position themselves for a possible pump in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins and previously this has been a good source of alpha for those willing to take a risk.A closer look at the data provided by CryptoQuant indicates that a seismic shift in the makeup of the stablecoin market may be taking shape as USDT issuance has begun to stagnate while the circulating supply of competitors like USD Coin (USDC) has resumed its uptrend over the past week.When looking at the exchange inflows and reserves of each individual stablecoin, there has actually been an increase in USDC deposited onto exchanges while the amount of USDT has declined, leading to the plateau seen in total stablecoin reserves held on exchanges.This is significant because Tether printing has historically been the impetus for major market moves, but its continued legal challenges and questions regarding assets held in reserve have made holding the token more of a liability as regulators increasingly crackdown on the wild west nature of the cryptocurrency market.As seen on the chart above, while the circulating supply of stablecoins was on a steady rise through the first five months of 2021 and accelerated somewhat as the market sold-off in May, issuance came to a standstill at the beginning of June as the reality set in that a bearish trend had taken over the market.There was also a spike in the stablecoin inflow transaction count that occurred on May 29, just as the stablecoin supply was peaking, which was followed by a brief increase in the price of BTC to $40,000 before another wave of selling dropped the price back below $34,000 and stomped out any building momentum.Since then, stablecoin inflows to exchanges have fallen to the lowest level since October 2020. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index also registers ""extreme fear"", backing up the argument that there is a lack of demand from retail and institutional level investors.While the month of June had seen a dry spell of stablecoin deposits onto exchanges, the drought may have come to an end on June 21 as a drop in the price of BTC below $33,000 appears to have enticed stablecoin holders to consider buying the dip.#Bitcoin some signs of life, stablecoin floweth in.
Shh don't say anything, you'll scare it away! pic.twitter.com/HrWtizpKJOFurther evidence of activity for USDC has been provided by Whale Alert, a well-known Twitter bot that posted numerous updates about USDC minting and transfers on June 21 as the crypto market experienced another round of selling.76,672,444 #USDC (76,672,444 USD) minted at USDC Treasuryhttps://t.co/v4OLyuuJE2Typically, stablecoin inflows are viewed as bullish, a recent newsletter from CryptoQuant offered a word of caution because similar spikes in stablecoin issuance in the past were followed by a prolonged period of sideways trading or price declines.CryptoQuant said:Related: Institutional selling of crypto reaches longest streak since Feb 2018This data serves as a warning that not all stablecoin issuance is a predictor of Bitcoin price rising because there are a number of factors that could account for mintings, such as institutional investors buying USDCfor a future purchase, or even altcoin and DeFi protocols preparing to integrate USDC pairs.In the long run, this shift has the potential to be beneficial for the crypto sector as audited projects like USDC are deemed more legitimate in the eyes of governments and regulators, but the sheer size of USDT's $62.67 billion market cap and its ubiquity across crypto exchanges means that any attempt to de-Tether will likely bring pain to the market.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

437,"Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped roughly 22% over the past 7 days, retesting the $31,700 area for the second time in June. The most pressing news for the negative performance has been China supposedly cracking down bank accounts of over-the-counter desks, according to some analysts:China cracking down on the bank accounts of #bitcoin OTC desks, this is getting serious!!!However, as reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin's hash rate dropping nearly 50% to an 8-month low could also have played a vital role in the price correction. Not even MicroStrategy's recent $489 million purchase was enough to sustain the $35,000 support.The movement raised suspicions that the June 25 options and futures expiry could also be behind the move. After all, this month will potentially settle $2.5 billion worth of options and another $2 billion in futures contracts.Currently, the CME futures represent nearly half of the futures open interest, although historically, most investors roll over their position during the last week of trading.Market makers and arbitrage desks tend to carry a short futures position while simultaneously holding BTC, thus profiting from the premium to regular spot exchange markets. Meanwhile, large asset managers such as Tudor Investments carry long futures exposure.However, there is no gain in rolling an option contract that is already worthless. With less than five days until expiry, a right to buy Bitcoin (call) at $44,000 is trading at $20.The initial picture favors bulls, as the neutral-to-bullish call (buy) options contracts are 36% more present for June 25 expiry.Related: Ethereum’s $1.5B options expiry on June 25 will be a make-or-break momentNotice how 87% of the right to buy (call) options have been placed above $34,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin stays below that level, only $200 million worth of open interest from those neutral-to-bullish contracts will partake in the June expiry.Meanwhile, 46% of the protective put options have been opened above $34,000. This represents a $510 million open interest, giving those neutral-to-bearish contracts a significant advantage.The $310 million difference favoring bears will be reduced by $190 million if Bitcoin trades above $36,000 on June 25. On the other hand, bears can add another $140 million open interest by pressuring the price below $32,000. The potential $450 million advantage is substantial and should not be ignored.For the bulls, it might make sense to throw in the towel, lick their wounds, and maybe open new positions using a front spread with puts, allowing gains with no upfront cost besides margin.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

438,"Institutional managers continued to take profits on their cryptocurrency holdings, with funds dedicated to Bitcoin (BTC) registering their sixth consecutive weekly outflows, according to CoinShares. Outflows from digital asset investment products totaled $79 million last week, marking the third consecutive weekly decline and the longest stretch of drawdowns since February 2018. Outflows from Bitcon funds totaled $89 million, whereas Ethereum (ETH) products endured a $1.9 million decline.Year-to-date, Bitcoin investment products have generated over $4.1 billion in net inflows. Ether products, meanwhile, have accumulated $992 million since the start of 2021.Multi-asset investment products that hold a basket of cryptocurrencies bucked the downtrend last week by registering $10 million in inflows. These funds have now generated $351 million in inflows this year, data revealed.Related: Ethereum investment products see largest weekly outflows on record — CoinSharesInstitutional buying of cryptocurrencies has wavered in recent weeks as portfolio managers continue to track a massive decline in asset values. Bitcoin is currently languishing below $33,000, having declined 50% from its May peak. The combined market value of all cryptocurrencies plunged below $1.4 trillion on Monday, virtually halving last month’s high.While on-chain metrics seem to show favorable signs of a bottom — namely, that Bitcoin is being scooped up by long-term holders at the expense of newer wallets — market sentiment remains overwhelmingly bearish due to negative headlines. China’s ban on Bitcoin mining, an ominous “death cross” for Bitcoin and Grayscale’s giant BTC unlocking in July are just some of the headlines weighing down investor sentiment."
439,"In a bearish environment, traders latch on to every bit of negative news and make that a an excuse to sell. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped over $1,000 within a few minutes as news hit the stands that the third-largest Chinese bank, the Agricultural Bank of China, will not allow the use of its services for crypto transactions. Although the bank later deleted its anti-crypto statement, the damage was already done. Similarly, traders have latched on to the news that the Chinese crackdown on Bitcoin miners and this has resulted in the hash rate dropping to an 8-month low.While this may be a negative in the short term, several analysts believe this is a positive development for the long term. “The ‘China-dominated’ Bitcoin mining era may be coming to an end,” said Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation. As mining activity shifts to other user-friendly jurisdictions, the network is likely to flourish.Among all the bearish news and price action, MicroStrategy has disclosed the purchase of 13,005 Bitcoin at an average price of $37,617. This takes the firm’s total holding to 105,085 Bitcoin at an average price of just over $26,000 per Bitcoin.Will MicroStrategy’s purchase attract other institutional investors and result in a relief rally? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin completed the dreaded death cross on June 19 and this seems to have attracted further selling from the bears. The sellers have pulled the price down to the critical support at $31,000 today.The bulls had successfully defended the $31,000 support on May 23 and again on June 8. Therefore, the level may again attract buying from the aggressive bulls. The relative strength index (RSI) is attempting to form a bullish divergence, which is another positive sign.If the price rebounds off $31,000, the BTC/USDT pair will attempt to rise to $42,451.67. This could keep the pair range-bound between these two levels for a few more days.On the upside, the rally is likely to face resistance at the 50-day simple moving average ($41,904). If the pair turns down from this resistance, the bears will again try to sink the price below $31,000.If they succeed, the pair could decline to $28,000 and if this support also cracks, the next stop could be $20,000.Ether (ETH) broke below the symmetrical triangle pattern on June 18. This indicated that the consolidation of the past few days has resolved in favor of the bears. Sustained selling has pulled the price down to the 200-day SMA ($1,870).The bulls will try to defend the zone between the 200-day SMA and the May 23 low at $1,728.74. If the price rebounds off this zone, the bulls will again try to push the price back into the triangle. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that buyers are accumulating at lower levels.However, the 50-day SMA ($2,869) has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped below 35, suggesting that bears are in command. If bears sink the price below the support zone, the ETH/USDT pair could drop to $1,536.92 and then to $1,293.18.Binance Coin (BNB) broke below the uptrend line on June 18 and the bears are currently attempting to sink the price below the $291.06 support.If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could challenge the 200-day SMA ($261). This is an important support to watch out for because the bulls had aggressively defended this support on May 21.If the price rebounds off the 200-day SMA, the pair could rise to the downtrend line. A break above this resistance could clear the path for an up-move to $379.58 and then $433.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 200-day SMA, the pair could drop to $200 and then to $126.75.Related: Classic bearish chart pattern forms for Bitcoin as BTC price tumbles to $32KCardano (ADA) has dropped below the critical support at $1.33 today. If bears sustain the price below this level, the altcoin could continue its decline and reach the next major support at $1.The bulls are likely to defend the $1 support aggressively as the 200-day SMA ($0.98) is just below this level. If the price rebounds off this level, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to $1.33 where the bears may mount a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from this level, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies. A break below the 200-day SMA could open the doors for a further fall to $0.80 and then $0.68.This negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level and rises above the 50-day SMA ($1.62).XRP bounced off the 200-day SMA ($0.72) on June 20 but the bulls could not sustain the price above $0.75. Renewed selling has pulled the price back below the 200-day SMA today.If bears sink the price below $0.65, the selling could intensify and the XRP/USDT pair may drop to the next support at $0.43. The downsloping 50-day SMA ($1.09) and the RSI near the oversold zone suggest that sellers are in command.Conversely, if the price rebounds off $0.65, the buyers will make one more attempt to push and sustain the price above $0.75. If they manage to do that, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The pair may then rise to $0.93 and then to $1.07.Dogecoin (DOGE) broke below the neckline of a large head and shoulders pattern on June 18 and has continued lower. The bulls will now try to defend the $0.21 support aggressively.If the price rebounds off $0.21, the bulls will attempt to push the price back above the neckline. If they succeed, it will indicate strong buying at lower levels. The DOGE/USDT pair may then rise to the 50-day SMA ($0.39).Conversely, if bears sink the price below $0.21, the pair could drop to the 200-day SMA ($0.15). The bulls may again try to stall the decline at this level but if they fail, the pair may drop to the next major support at $0.10.Polkadot (DOT) slipped below the support line of the triangle on June 20 but the bulls pushed the price back into the triangle. However, the sellers are in no mood to relent and they have again pulled the price below the support line today.The downsloping 50-day SMA ($28.22) and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears have the upper hand. The DOT/USDT pair could now drop to the critical support at $15, which has not been breached on a closing basis since Jan. 16.Therefore, the bulls will attempt to defend the $15 support aggressively. A strong rebound off this level could push the price to $20 and then to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this resistance will be the first sign of strength.Contrary to this assumption, if bears sink the price below $15, the pair could witness further selling and decline to the next major support at $7.50.Uniswap (UNI) broke below the 200-day SMA ($22.20) on June 18. The failure of the bulls to defend this critical support indicated that supply exceeds demand. The buyers tried to stage a recovery on June 20 but failed to push the price above the 200-day SMA.That resulted in renewed selling today. The downsloping 50-day SMA ($28.63) and the RSI near the oversold zone suggest that bears are in command. If the sellers sink the price below $16.49, the UNI/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $13.04.The bulls are likely to defend the $13.04 support aggressively. If the price rebounds off this level, the pair could consolidate between $13.04 and $21.50 for a few days. On the contrary, a break below $13.04 could pull the price down to $10.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has plunged below the $538.11 support, completing the descending triangle pattern. There is a minor support at $468.13 but if this support cracks, the selling could intensify further.The 50-day SMA ($844) has been sloping down and the RSI is trading near the oversold territory, indicating advantage to the bears. If the sellers sink the price below $468.13, the BCH/USDT pair could slide to $400 and then $370.This bearish view will invalidate if the price turns up and quickly rises above the 200-day SMA ($609). Such a move will suggest that the bulls aggressively bought at lower levels. The pair may then rise to the 50-day SMA.Litecoin (LTC) broke below the support line on June 18, indicating a lack of urgency among the bulls to buy at that level. The failure to push the price back above the support line in the past two days has attracted further selling today.The downsloping 50-day SMA ($222) and the RSI near the oversold territory indicate that bears are in control. The LTC/USDT pair could now retest the May 23 intraday low at $118.03. This level may act as a strong support but if the bears sink the price below it, the pair may drop to $100 and then to $70.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off $118.03, the bulls will try to push the price to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above this level will be the first indication of strength. A trend change may be signaled after the bulls propel and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

440,"In a recent interview with Lex Fridman, Charles Hoskinson — founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum — offered his views on Bitcoin (BTC). The 33-year-old was less than complimentary, calling it “slow” and in desperate need of an upgrade. Hoskinson also took issue with the recent Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, comparing the whole thing to a ridiculous religious movement.“I can't for the life of me understand, what the hell is the point of Bitcoin?” asked Hoskinson.But while Bitcoin has proven itself an adaptable blockchain with a decade of history, many within the crypto industry have significant questions about the “point” of Hoskinson’s own project, Cardano.A week before this interview aired, Vitalik Buterin sat down with Fridman for a lively discussion. The Russian-Canadian programmer was asked about Cardano and whether he thought Hoskinson’s project had a future. Buterin criticized Cardano’s reliance on the peer review system. Instead of focusing on academic proofs, Buterin favors a more heuristic approach. This was a sly dig — a super-geek mic drop.Related: Bitcoin is ‘own worst enemy’ and will lose to Ethereum: Charles HoskinsonFor those unfamiliar with Cardano, the idea of peer review is very much a leitmotif of the budding proof-of-stake blockchain platform. This, we’re told, has investors excited. And it should, in an ideal world. Peer review is the principal metric by which scholarly legitimacy is measured. For progress, the evaluative process is invaluable.With Cardano, it has been suggested that the term ""peer review"" is little more than a clever marketing ploy, an ingenious way of giving the proof-of-stake blockchain platform an air of superiority. Yet Hoskinson is a staunch advocate of peer review and is fiercely defensive of any criticisms that come its way. He appears to be fully invested in academic proofs. But is this a smart investment?When one actually examines the state of today’s peer review system, the answer appears to be ""No."" After all, the peer review system, we're told, is genuinely “toxic.”Last year, David Rosenthal, a highly respected British-American scientist, wrote a blog post titled ""Breaking: Peer Review is Broken!"" As Rosenthal argues, peer review has been in a ruinous state for “more than the last decade,” with cases of fraud occurring on a regular basis.As Science magazine warned back in 2018, there has been a disturbing increase in the number of articles retracted, often due to fraud. Three years on, things don’t appear to be getting any better. If anything, they are getting worse.Across the board, from math to social sciences, the peer review system continues to be plagued by biases and sectarianism.John Baumgardner asked the following: “Are there circumstances in which the scientific method ought to work, but for which the method does not provide ‘an accurate representation of the world’ — that is, a correct description of the way things really are?” Unfortunately, Baurngardner concluded, “The answer is yes.” To paraphrase Freeman Dyson, science is more mystery than truth.What the hell is the point of Cardano?If Bitcoin is nothing but an overzealous religious movement, what is Cardano? Fridman put this question to Hoskinson, who then proceeded to speak for nine straight minutes outlining the ways in which Cardano gives ""digital identity"" to people in developing countries.Others, however, see Hoskinon’s brainchild as something far less noble. According to Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Cardano is a “cult,” and a “weird” one at that. By default, this would make Hoskinson a cult leader.Whatever the pros and cons of the technology that underpins the Cardano blockchain, and whatever Hoskinson’s loyal followers may see that’s worth investing in, the concern is that the cult of science is very real — and that an over-reliance on the peer review process could prove to be highly problematic.The irony of Hoskinson’s argument is that while Satoshi Nakamoto may not have jumped through peer review hoops to promulgate his white paper, the market itself has already passed judgment on Bitcoin. If peer review is “the evaluation of work by one or more people with similar competencies as the producers of the work,” then Bitcoin has been reviewed positively for a decade by some of the most talented developers in the world.Certainly, it has its critics. Certainly, it has its flaws. But exposure to the real world forged Bitcoin’s resilience. And whether Cardano will survive in the heat of real-world usage is still a matter for some debate.

441,"Amid the ongoing crackdown on cryptocurrency mining in China, prices of graphic cards from major GPU providers like Nvidia and Asus are becoming more affordable. According to a Monday report by South China Morning Post (SCMP), prices of some graphic cards have tumbled as much as two-thirds on Chinese e-commerce platforms after Sichuan province terminated mining operations.Asus’ flagship RTX 3060 card was reportedly down to 4,699 Chinese yuan ($730) on Monday from its peak price of 13,499 yuan ($2,100) in May on JD.com-operated online retail site Tmall.Nvidia's Quadro P1000, a less advanced card, dropped to 2,429 yuan ($380) on a JD.com franchise store, down from a peak of about 3,000 yuan ($470) in early May, the SCMP reported, citing price changes tracked by e-commerce data provider Manmanbuy.The price downturn aligns with a major sell-off on the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin (BTC) tumbling to $32,500 amid another wave of FUD in China.Related: Bitcoin hash rate hits 8-month low as Chinese miners power downOn Monday, China’s central bank reiterated the country’s ban on cryptocurrency trading, reportedly urging banks and payment institutions to halt services for accounts associated with crypto trading activity. After banning crypto trading back in 2017, the Chinese government has been toughening its stance on crypto recently, launching a major crackdown on cryptocurrency mining. The latest news follows a series of mining bans in several major crypto mining hubs in China including hydropower-based provinces like Sichuan and Yunnan. Authorities in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Qinghai have also ordered mining operations to shutter."
442,"El Salvador recently added Bitcoin as legal tender. In barely over a decade, an open-source, cypherpunk, radically new money system, with no publicly known creator and open to participation in both using and building from anyone in the world, has gone from zero value and branded as a tool for criminals to now being accepted by a government as a legitimate legal tender. To say this has been a wild ride is an intense understatement. Now, for the first time in history, a fully decentralized digital money is recognized by a state as being just as legitimate as said state’s own currency.That being said, there’s some devil in the details of this otherwise wonderful announcement: The law specifically mentions Bitcoin (BTC) rather than cryptocurrencies as a whole and includes a government partnership with Strike, a payments company based around the Lightning Network, the primary off-chain scaling solution for Bitcoin. Because of the current scaling limitations of the first layer and the state of development of the second, this historic adoption could come with some headaches.I’ve been using cryptocurrency for about eight years now, living unbanked off of them for five. I also run my own Lightning node, and as such can compare and contrast the relative experiences between Bitcoin and what other networks could offer. Let’s dive into why the Salvadoran experiment could move the whole crypto space forward, though possibly not in a Bitcoin-first direction.Related: Adopting the Bitcoin standard? El Salvador writes itself into history booksPotentially hundreds of thousands of businesses are about to be forcibly onboarded. Rather than simply allowing and encouraging the adoption of Bitcoin, the new law in El Salvador specifically compels all merchants to accept it as payment:This compulsion will trigger a mass onboarding of new merchants to accept Bitcoin, whether they want to or not. This will result in hundreds of thousands of businesses, potentially more, seeking access to a network that already processes about that number across its entire ecosystem in a day. Imagine each merchant receiving a Bitcoin payment per day, doubling the number of transactions on a network that is already past capacity and creating a user-experience nightmare. Of course, the intent here is to use the Lightning Network to put as little activity on-chain as possible. However, even this may prove difficult. Here’s why, with a couple of different potential situations.Related: An asset for all classes: What to expect from Bitcoin as a legal tenderLet’s first imagine a case where a majority of businesses onboard to Bitcoin directly, using the network in a decentralized manner. On-chain fees fluctuate wildly but are frequently in the several-dollar range, if not higher. Even if customers are willing to pay those fees for smaller items, the merchant must pay those fees to move those funds eventually, incurring high fees (expected to be significantly higher after the additional pressure on the network). This is not a situation any merchant would likely appreciate.A more likely scenario is that they onboard to the Lightning Network, which in theory can allow them to both receive and send small payments for sub-cent fees. In reality, its structure and complexity would pose significant initial onboarding issues.To begin, using Lightning requires opening at least one channel, which necessitates an on-chain transaction. This, in turn, triggers the congestion and fee issues mentioned above, as well as maintaining the infrastructure online at all times. Additionally, one cannot receive funds without having them in a channel, meaning you need to either have someone lock up their own funds in a channel to you (which may necessitate payment), or you have to open a channel yourself to another node with your own money, then send that money through the channel to another source (such as making purchases, or to a separate wallet/node you control) in order to free up inbound liquidity.In short, a business must either be technically competent and initially possess the number of funds that they expect to receive before they have to rebalance a channel, or they must pay a service provider. The amount of funding and technical know-how necessary to make this happen may seem doable by upper-class standards, but the chances that most merchants in a developing country can afford a Raspberry Pi and several dollars of extra startup capital just to receive Bitcoin are slim.Now, there’s a second case where businesses simply onboard to a centralized, custodial solution that settles in fiat currency directly to their bank account. This certainly solves many of the issues posed by direct exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem, though not all, and additionally, it introduces new ones.First, if a service like Strike actually does open Lightning channels for all users, then each new user onboarded represents one on-chain transaction. Even though this is fewer than in the previous case, this still represents X transactions or the entirety of Bitcoin’s on-chain capacity for Y days straight. And lest we forget, Strike itself needs to scale in addition to the network, and a fledgling company will certainly face growing pains when jumping to onboarding an entire country’s merchants. Does anyone remember the numerous times when exchanges like Coinbase have gone offline when faced with an influx of new customers? Imagine that, only worse.Additionally, let’s not forget the entire reason this was thought of as helpful to begin with: Many Salvadorans are unbanked and have issues getting access to key financial services. A world in which most businesses accept Bitcoin through just those financial services faces the same challenges which prevented them from being included before. How many Salvadorans lack the necessary documentation to open a bank account? How will they be able to instantly convert to fiat currency without a bank account? Those problems will not only still be present under a mass adoption scenario, but they will be amplified by unfamiliar infrastructure and nascent services.The likely scenario will be a mix of both cases, but predominantly the second. This will invariably result in a user experience and onboarding nightmare which, while exposing many more people to cryptocurrency, will cause a lot of them to come away with a negative opinion, and possibly seek alternatives.Let’s take a quick look at what an alternative scenario might look like. I have the most experience with Dash since it’s what I use for my daily money, but any cryptocurrency with successful on-chain scaling — Bitcoin Cash (BCH) or Nano, if the latter solves its recent spam problems — should provide a similar, though not equivalent, experience. Because of Dash’s masternode network of incentivized nodes and emphasis on mass on-chain scaling, all transactions are finalized in under two seconds for a fraction of a cent. Any merchant can create a wallet at no cost, waiting period or stress to the network (unless they use custodial solutions and are at the mercy of the centralized architecture’s scaling concerns). Any user can easily download an app, receive DASH, and send it smoothly for a negligible cost, with the payment secured instantly without a realistic chance of failure. The merchant can then move those funds instantly, any number of times, also for fractions of a cent. Moreover, the DashPay username wallet leveraging decentralized digital identities, already publicly available on testnet, will soon make the experience even better by eliminating confusing and long cryptographic hashes.Contrast this with Lightning, where every customer and merchant has to pay an on-chain transaction fee (and merchants must solve liquidity) in order to operate in a decentralized manner. When using centralized solutions, there must be a certain level of trust between each party to ensure that the perfect conditions to enable a relatively smooth experience are met. A major hub node going down, a spike in on-chain congestion, an influx of new users, or difficulties in a service provider maintaining profitability can all result in an inability to route payments, higher fees, long wait times, critical features turned off or service refused to customers altogether. And remember, all costs must ultimately be passed on to the consumer, meaning that the numerous variables, infrastructure and capital investment involved in running Lightning infrastructure at scale will be passed on to the end-user.How will this exciting new chapter in cryptocurrency’s history pan out? It’s impossible to know for sure, but if it extensively leverages the Bitcoin Lightning Network, we may be in for a bumpy road in the short term. Even if it fails, however, it will likely be a success in that it will pave the way for all types of cryptocurrency to be used in commerce and considered as official as money, which will inevitably continue the global financial revolution.While the Salvadoran experiment will certainly accelerate the space forward, it may be too much usage for Bitcoin to comfortably handle at this point. Thankfully, hundreds of other cryptocurrencies are waiting in the wings to step in. Bitcoin bottleneck or not, the crypto space is going to be just fine.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

443,"MicroStrategy has bought even more Bitcoin (BTC) despite the current price struggles for the largest crypto by market capitalization.According to an announcement on Monday, the business intelligence firm purchase 13,005 BTC at an average price of $37,617 for a combined total of about $489 million.Monday's report takes MicroStrategy's Bitcoin balance sheet north of the 100,000 mark with the firm now holding 105,085 BTC.At the current BTC spot price, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings are worth $2.74 billion which amounts to an average of a little over $26,000 per Bitcoin.As part of the announcement, the company revealed that its MacroStrategy LLC subsidiary holds 92,079 BTC of the total Bitcoin balance.Earlier in June, the firm had announced a $400 million debt raise to expand its Bitcoin treasury holdings. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the junk bond offering was oversubscribed four-fold causing the company to increase the debt offering to $500 million.Without even accounting for its latest purchase, MicroStrategy holds the most Bitcoin on its balance sheet among all publicly-listed companies with BTC treasuries.MicroStrategy holds more than twice the Bitcoin held by Elon Musk's Tesla.Monday's announcement comes amid a red day for Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. BTC price briefly tumbled to the $32,000 price mark with Ether (ETH) slipping below $2,000 for the first time since late May.As of the time of writing, the crypto market capitalization is down more than 5% in the last 24-hour trading period and is currently at $1.37 trillion.Monday's price downturn coincided with news coming out of China reaffirming a previous ban on public and private financial institutions from servicing crypto-related businesses.The news follows even more concerted crypto crackdowns from Beijing that has also impacted Bitcoin miners."
444,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls should look for a cover, at least as far as chart technicals are concerned.The flagship cryptocurrency continued its price declines into the new weekly session, hitting $32,105 ahead of the London opening bell following an approximately 10% intraday drop. In doing so, it raised the prospect of retesting its quarter-to-date low of $30,000 for either a bearish breakdown or a bullish pullback.But as traders grapple with the ongoing medium-term bias conflict in the Bitcoin market, one classic technical pattern has surfaced to boost a bearish outlook.Spotted by Keith Wareing, an independent market analyst, the so-called “Inverse Cup and Handle” structure points to an extended downside price correction ahead in the Bitcoin market. In detail, the pattern develops when an asset forms a large crescent shape as it rallies higher and corrects lower, followed by a less extreme, upward rebound.Traders look at the Inverse Cup and Handle pattern as their cue to open short positions to target deeper levels. The most extreme bearish target, in such a case, is determined by measuring the distance between the cup’s top and the pattern’s breakout level.Meanwhile, traders typically spot breakout levels when the price breaks out from the handle pattern to the downside while accompanied by higher volumes.Based on the chart provided by Wareing, Bitcoin’s recent price action — ranging from its pump to nearly $65,000 followed by a dump to $30,000 and a retracement to $40,000 — almost checks all the boxes that confirm the presence of an Inverse Cup and Handle structure.Except, the Bitcoin price still awaits a bearish breakout.Back in play pic.twitter.com/aqLVazTK8JThe depressive Bitcoin setup appeared as traders assessed the United States Federal Reserve’s hawkish reversal on interest rates and inflation. Last week, the U.S. central bank signaled that it could raise benchmark lending rates by the end of 2023 instead of 2024 to tame the rising inflation.James Bullard, one of the Fed officials, said separately on Friday that the central bank could raise rates by as early as 2022. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also said in a press conference on Wednesday that his office would move to discuss reducing the $120 billion worth of monthly asset purchases it had started in March 2020.Bitcoin and other pandemic winners, including gold and Wall Street stock indexes, fell in tandem owing to the Fed’s hawkish tones. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a pool of top foreign currencies, rose to its two-month high, suggesting a renewed appetite for cash among investors.The latest Bitcoin price plunge also took cues from reports of China’s deepening crackdown on crypto mining farms in the region. The state-backed newspaper Global Times reported that authorities in Sichuan ordered miners to wind down their operations.Sichuan is home to China’s second-largest crypto mining community. The latest ban means that 90% of China’s mining capacity, which makes 75% of the global computing supply, has probably gone offline, noted Global Times.Bitcoin’s hash rate dropped to its November 2020 low following the China crackdown story. Jeffrey Ross, founder and CEO of Vailshire Capital Management, said that he expects Bitcoin to stay weak for the next one to three weeks, fearing liquidation at the end of Chinese miners.Nevertheless, he added that the cryptocurrency’s macro outlook remains bullish as long as it holds key technical targets above 12- and 48-month moving averages.Bitcoin’s 48-month moving average is currently around the $13,000 level."
445,"United Kingdom-based financial institution TSB Banking Group Plc. will soon ban its over 5.4 million customers from buying Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.According to a report by The Telegraph on Saturday, the bank’s imminent crypto ban is due to alleged cases of fraud associated with cryptocurrency transactions.Bank TSB has reportedly received a plethora of complaints from customers about crypto-related fraud cases. Indeed, the U.K. bank says about 12.5% of payments to crypto exchange platforms involve transactions as against one in 5,500 for non-virtual currency-related transfers.Crypto exchange giant Binance has reportedly been linked to the rising number of crypto fraud complaints lodged by the bank’s customers. Two-thirds of suspected cases were linked to Binance, with 849 instances occurring between mid-March and mid-April.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, U.K. bank NatWest issued a crypto scam alert back in May after reportedly receiving a record number of complaints in Q1. Earlier in April, the bank had served an anti-crypto notice to clients and customers to stay away from cryptocurrencies.Apart from Binance, TSB Bank identified United States exchange service Kraken as another platform linked to a significant number of suspected fraud cases. The U.K. bank also criticized crypto exchanges for not responding to fraud-related customer complaints.Commenting on plans to introduce a crypto ban, a spokesperson for TSB Bank remarked that it was the bank’s obligation to protect customers from platforms with “excessively high fraud rates.”TSB Bank joins a growing list of U.K. financial institutions that have barred customers from crypto. Apart from NatWest, other British banks such as Barclays and Starling have moved to ban customers from depositing cash in cryptocurrency trading platforms.Related: UK Starling bank to resume crypto exchange deposits in late JuneEarlier in June, Starling announced that it would resume allowing customers to deposit cash in crypto exchanges from Wednesday.At the start of the year, HSBC began preventing customers from withdrawing profits from crypto exchanges to their bank accounts.While there is no crypto ban in the U.K., regulators remain critical of cryptocurrencies. In May, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned that crypto investors ran the risk of losing all their money.Bailey’s comments echoed a similar warning issued by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority back in January."
446,"The Bank of Russia continues its tough stance on cryptocurrency trading despite growing concerns over the country missing out on the digital asset industry. The governor of Russia’s central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, reiterated the bank’s negative stance on crypto in a Monday interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, arguing that crypto is one of the most dangerous investments that currently exist.Nabiullina mentioned crypto within the context of other high-risk investment spaces like foreign exchange markets. “It’s far easier to lose on the foreign exchange market than to win,” she said, stating that “speculative crypto assets” are even riskier.The bank governor said that prices in the cryptocurrency market are extremely volatile, stating that “losses can be tremendous.” She further stressed that the Bank of Russia does not recommend crypto investments to the public:Nabiullina has previously stated that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are “fake money” and should not be used for settlements in Russia. Back in 2017, she referred to the growing global popularity of crypto as a “gold rush.”Related: Bank of Russia to start digital ruble trials in 2022Despite being skeptical about crypto, Nabiullina is optimistic about the digital ruble, the Bank of Russia’s central bank digital currency project. She said last year that a digital ruble would help businesses by cutting out financial intermediaries.There has been growing criticism of the Bank of Russia’s stance on crypto, with one State Duma member accusing the central bank of being short-sighted on the industry. Russian industrial tycoon Oleg Deripaska blasted the central bank last week for its hesitance in recognizing cryptocurrencies. "
447,"Bitcoin (BTC) is lower going into a new week’s trading — Monday has seen a test of levels below $33,000, and bulls are struggling.What could be next? With bullish short-term voices few and far between, it seems that cryptocurrency just isn’t of interest to investors right now.Against a backdrop of macro market uncertainty, low volumes and claims of a bull market top, Bitcoin has a lot to do to convince the market that the good times still lie ahead.Cointelegraph offers five things to consider when charting what might happen to BTC/USD in the coming days.The main focus for investors throughout the economy this week is the United States Federal Reserve.After last week’s comments from Chair Jerome Powell, the U.S. dollar made strong gains, while stocks then staged a sell-off as market participants repositioned. The Dow Jones, for example, fell 3.5% in a day — its worst since last October.The volatility came because Powell hinted that the Fed might soon begin tapering the extent to which it intervenes in the market. This became standard practice as part of its response to the coronavirus and the economic shutdowns that followed.Related: 4 reasons why Paul Tudor Jones’ 5% Bitcoin exposure advice is difficult for major fundsA reduction in purchases, which CNBC noted currently comes to around $120 billion per month, therefore presents a noticeable switch-up.Powell will speak again on Tuesday, this time before the Senate, and it is thought that he will give more information on the news that he broadly outlined last week.“I’m most interested certainly in what Powell has to say,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Global Advisors, said on Friday.Should surprises appear, the volatility that characterized the past few days could continue. Good news for the dollar, as Cointelegraph often notes, tends to be bad for Bitcoin price action.“I didn’t get good vibes from BTC chart when I woke up,” popular trader Crypto Ed summarized as the week began.He added that the dollar could continue to “pressure” Bitcoin until the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) hits around 94 from its current levels of 92.2.It’s not a good look for Bitcoin spot price action as the week gets underway — but who’s to blame?In addition to the Fed, another economy is wielding its influence on crypto markets again, this time more directly: China.In a statement, the Agricultural Bank of China, the country’s third-largest lender, explicitly stated that its services must not be used for cryptocurrency-related transactions.“Agricultural Bank of China issued a notice that they will not participate in virtual currency transactions and related activities,” China-oriented news resource 8btc reported, translating the original document for social media users.The result of its publication was instantly recognizable — Bitcoin plummeted by over $1,000 in minutes before rebounding to $33,000.Such behavior is far from surprising, but patience is now wearing thin over knee-jerk reactions to China. The latest episode proved to be a case in point — the bank deleted the statement shortly after publishing it, but the damage was done.Quick explainer for those confused re AGbank

The agricultural bank of china released an announcement saying any customers dealing with crypto will have accounts closed

15 mins later it appears they deleted the notice

2021 getting rugged by the third largest bank in the world pic.twitter.com/qXax70lqgAOverall, nothing has fundamentally changed in the Chinese government’s position on Bitcoin since its controversial trading ban came into force in September 2017.“Half the Bitcoin network has now been shut down by China. Bitcoin hash rate at levels of mid-2020,” Charles Edwards, CEO of asset manager Capriole, noted in a series of tweets on the mining crackdown that formed the previous source of Chinese price pressure.Others argued that Bitcoin has gained new opportunities thanks to the punitive measures from both banks and government — mining will shift elsewhere, and the network will flourish as a result of making use of friendlier, more reliable jurisdictions.“The ‘China-dominated’ Bitcoin mining era may be coming to an end.” Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation, commented on a farewell message from one miner in the province of Sichuan.As $30,000 support lurches ever closer, concern and confusion characterize reactions over BTC/USD performance on Monday.This is because indicators of a bullish turnaround are there, but price has so far done the opposite.One of them is funding rates, which firmly favor bulls. At the time of writing, rates are negative across exchanges — a classic sign that a move up is on the way.Moves among seasoned hodlers confirm the trend, with coins being ferreted away even at levels before Monday’s dip.“Oh my, Rick Astley is back,” statistician Willy Woo declared alongside a chart showing Bitcoin’s decreasing liquid supply. “Rick Astley” refers to a popular metaphor for strong hands.Analyst William Clemente III added that this “re-accumulation” echoed what happened in 2013 when Bitcoin had two bullish phases separated by a major retracement.“HODLers stacking BTC heavily here,” he confirmed, noting net position change data.China has had a significant impact on Bitcoin network fundamentals.As Edwards noted above, thanks to a broad miner shutdown, thhash rate has fallen significantly from its peak just months ago.This is troubling in the short term, particularly for those who adhere to the classic mantra of “price follows hash rate,” but is necessarily short lived.Related: Forecasting Bitcoin price using quantitative models, Part 4Thanks to Bitcoin’s inherent setup, there is always an attractive opportunity to mine somewhere under different circumstances. A miner rout incentivizes participation on the network thanks to the hash rate, and subsequently difficulty, dropping.The cost of participation thus reduces, and mining becomes a viable proposition for more and more potential entities.Meanwhile, Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, is at pains to stress that the impact of China on the hash rate has been at most around 39% from the top. Figures vary widely because the hash rate is an estimate and is ultimately impossible to measure definitively.PSA to front-run the next round of confused china hashrate FUD: hashrate has NOT halved, you are looking at VERY inaccurate data. 7-day peak 130 EH, current 98 EH maybe -25% down. and ATH peak 160 EH vs 98 = -39%. please. get. your. basic. facts. right. when reporting. thanks pic.twitter.com/Add83UvIj3Not everyone thinks that the outlook for Bitcoin is all bad news.Some comparisons to previous bull market years place 2021 solidly within the framework of standard price performance.As popular Twitter analyst Root highlighted on the weekend, on-chain indicators are flashing “oversold” rather than bearish despite current external pressures.So bearish today even though we are still hovering around the same range (~35k) totally in line with previous bull markets!
#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/4Ivn3oVUhJOthers, such a stock-to-flow model creator PlanB, are even bullish on practically every timeframe beyond the daily chart.As Cointelegraph reported, his “worst case scenario” is now $135,000 for BTC/USD by the end of this year.Stock-to-flow has accommodated all of 2021’s price surprises and remains valid."
448,"Bitcoin (BTC) shed $1,000 in minutes on Monday as fresh news from China succeeded in routing bulls yet again. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting local lows beneath $32,500 on Monday.The cause, which disturbed a day of recovery from another dip, appeared to once again come from China via a major bank statement that confirmed it would not allow the use of its services for transactions related to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.Involved was China’s third-largest bank, the Agricultural Bank of China.“The statement emphasized that once relevant behaviors are discovered, account transactions will be immediately suspended, customer relationships will be terminated, and relevant departments will be reported,” journalist Colin Wu reported on Twitter.Related: Bitcoin price can hit $450K in 2021, $135K is 'worst-case scenario' — PlanBThe resulting volatility, while unnerving, matches behavior from previous announcements by China. The country has become the source of headaches for Bitcoin bulls in recent weeks as miners face a crackdown and officials reiterate the existing restrictions on cryptocurrency in place since 2017.Ah more China FUD.
Glad we are consistent.As Cointelegraph reported, however, many argue that the price pressure is a typical overreaction and that, ultimately, Bitcoin will benefit from a move away from Chinese reliance.Interestingly, reports that the announcement by the Agricultural Bank of China has since been deleted are now beginning to surface. Ok guys. Seems like the bank deleted the notice only a few minutes after it released. https://t.co/6YrXyVthOm pic.twitter.com/PCbVIQYUru“The Bitcoin network has just experienced the biggest attack in its history,” Charles Edwards, CEO of asset manager Capriole, said on Sunday."
449,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) hash rate has fallen to its lowest levels since early November as mining operations in China start unplugging.Bitcoin’s network hash rate, a measure of its computational horsepower, has slumped 46% since its peak level in mid-May. According to Bitinfocharts, Bitcoin’s hash rate is currently 91.2 exahashes per second (EH/s), close to half of its 171.4 EH/s high posted less than six weeks ago.Bitinfocharts has also reported a drop in mining profitability from a peak of $0.449 per day per terahash per second to current levels of $0.226 over the same period.Bitcoin’s hash rate has not been this low for eight months, last creeping below 90 EH/s on Nov. 3, 2020. A higher hash rate means greater competition among miners to validate new blocks, which also increases the scale of resources required to perform a 51% attack, thus making the network more secure.The slump in hash rate and mining profitability is due to the ongoing crackdown from Chinese authorities on Bitcoin mining facilities across the country. Over the weekend, images of major mining pools in China’s Sichuan province being shut down were shared across social media.We gonna witness a history in bitcoin mining tonight, all mining farms (about 8m kw electricity load) will shutdown at 12pm Beijing time tonight, Harare rate already dropped significantly after sichuan gov announce shut down bitcoins mining farms in Sichuan. pic.twitter.com/xRfqMCgWY1On Friday, authorities in Ya’an City — a prefecture-level city in the western part of Sichuan — ordered local Bitcoin mining operations to shut down. In late 2019, CoinShares estimated that Sichuan hosted more than half of the global hash rate, attracting miners with its cheap and seasonally abundant hydropower.On June 12, Yunnan provincial authorities also issued a notice ordering an investigation into the alleged illegal use of electrical power by individuals and companies involved in Bitcoin mining.According to a CNBC report published June 15, Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter noted Bitcoin’s hash rate was dropping, speculating, “It appears likely that installations are being turned off throughout the country.” In early May, Cointelegraph reported that there were already signs that Bitcoin’s hash rate was starting to leave China.Carter predicted at least half of Bitcoin’s entire hash rate will leave China over time.North America, particularly the state of Texas, has become one of the top destinations for what has been dubbed the “great mining migration” due to favorable legislation and an abundance of low-cost renewable energy."
450,"IOHK CEO and Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson has argued that Bitcoin (BTC) sits at a significant competitive disadvantage due to its slow speeds and will be usurped by proof-of-stake networks. In a five-hour podcast with computer scientist and AI researcher Lex Fridman the Cardano founder argued that proof-of-stake networks offering superior speed and functionality over the original cryptocurrency, stating:“You have to upgrade the damn thing!” Hoskinson exclaimed, regarding Bitcoin’s underlying proof-of-work consensus mechanism, and emphasizing that Bitcoin’s programmatic utility lags behind its competitors.Hoskinson also criticized the Bitcoin community for being reluctant to innovate beyond the cryptocurrency’s base layer, also describing Bitcoin’s second-layer scaling solutions as “highly fragile.”However, Cardano’s founder argued that Ethereum has grown to rival Bitcoin’s network but has a nimble development culture that embraces evolution.“What’s really cool is that Ethereum does not suffer that problem [...] It's getting to the point where it has the same network effect as Bitcoin, but the community has a completely different culture. They love evolving and upgrading,” he said, adding:Hoskinson, however, did acknowledge the battle for crypto dominance is a “much more complex game” than competition between Bitcoin and Ethereum, asserting that many other blockchains are now vying for major blockchain market share, unsurprisingly naming Cardano among others."
451,"In an interview with CNBC on June 14, legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones sounded the alarm over advancing inflation. After last week's consumer price index (CPI) report showed that United States inflation had hit a 13-year high, the founder of Tudor Investment advocated for a 5% Bitcoin (BTC) portfolio allocation.When combined, the world's 50 largest asset managers oversee $78.9 trillion in funds. A mere 1% investment in cryptocurrencies would amount to $789 billion, which more than Bitcoin's entire $723 billion market capitalization.However, there's a fundamental misunderstanding on how this industry works, and this is what impedes a 1% allocation, let alone a 5% one.Let's investigate a few major hurdles that the traditional financial sector will have to vault before really becoming Bitcoin apes.Investing in Bitcoin remains a significant hurdle for large mutual fund managers, especially considering their perceived risk. On June 11, The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned investors about the risks of Bitcoin futures trading — citing market volatility, a lack of regulation and fraud.Even though several stocks and commodities have similar or even higher 90-day volatility, somehow, the agency's focus remains on Bitcoin.DoorDash (DASH), a $49 billion U.S. listed company, holds a 96% volatility, versus Bitcoin's 90%. Meanwhile, Palantir Technologies (PLTR), a $44 billion U.S. tech stock, has an 87% volatility.Most of the mutual fund industry, mainly the multi-billion dollar asset managers, cannot buy physical Bitcoin. There is nothing specific about this asset class, but most pension funds and 401k vehicles do not allow direct investments in physical gold, art, or farmland.However, it is possible to circumvent these limitations using exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETN), and tradeable investment trusts. Cointelegraph previously explained the differences and risks assigned to ETFs and trusts, but that only scratches the surface as each fund has its own regulations and limits.While the fund manager has complete control over the investment decisions, they must follow each specific vehicle regulation and observe the risk controls imposed by the fund's administrator. Adding new instruments such as CME Bitcoin futures, for example, might require SEC approval. Renaissance Capital's Medallion funds faced this issue in April 2020.Those opting for CME Bitcoin futures, such as Tudor Investment, have to constantly roll over the position ahead of monthly expiries. This issue represents both liquidity risk and error tracking from the underlying instrument. Futures were not designed for long-term carry, and their prices vastly differ from regular spot exchanges.Banks are a relevant player in this field as JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, UBS, Goldman Sachs, and Citi figure among the world's largest mutual funds managers.The relationship with the remaining asset managers is tight because banks are relevant investors and distributors of these independent mutual funds. This entanglement goes even further because the same financial conglomerates dominate equities and debt offerings, meaning they ultimately decide on a mutual funds' allocation in such deals.While Bitcoin is yet to pose a direct threat to these industry mammoths, the lack of understanding and risk aversion, including the regulation uncertainties, cause most of the global $100 trillion professional fund managers to avoid the stress of venturing into a new asset class.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

452,"The U.S. Federal Reserve’s plans to advance its timeline for rate hikes to 2023 has led to profit-booking in the U.S. stock market, gold, and Bitcoin (BTC). The markets received a second jolt on June 18 after James Bullard, the president of the United States Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, warned th the first rate hike could come as soon as 2022.Now crypto analysts are divided on the next move from Bitcoin. Josh Rager believes Bitcoin may have hit its cycle top at $64,500 and Robert Kiyosaki, author of ""Rich Dad Poor Dad,"" believes Bitcoin can plummet to $24,000.However, PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price forecasting model, has retained his bullish view on Bitcoin. His best-case scenario for Bitcoin is a massive rally to $450,000 while his “worst-case scenario” also paints a bullish target at $135,000 by the end of 2021.Related: Bitcoin price dips below $34K as the day of Grayscale's giant BTC unlocking draws nearCiting recent on-chain data, other analysts have pointed out that long-term holders have been buying Bitcoin in the past few days.Can buying by the long-term investors offset selling from the speculators? What do the technicals project, a short-term recovery or a further fall? Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin has been range-bound between $31,000 and $42,451.67 for the past few days. The price turned down from $41,330 on June 15 and the bears pulled the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($37,439) on June 18.The sellers will now try to sink the price to the support of the range at $31,000. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the relative strength index (RSI) below 41 suggests that bears have the upper hand.However, the BTC/USDT pair rebounded off $31,000 on two previous occasions on May 23 and June 8, hence the bulls will again try to defend this level. If they succeed, the pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.Conversely, if bears sink the price below $31,000, the pair could drop to $28,000 and then to $20,000. Such a move will be a huge negative and it could delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.The bears have pulled the price below the $34,600 support on the 4-hour chart. If they manage to sustain the price below this level, the pair is likely to drop to the $31,000 support. The downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI near the oversold zone indicate advantage to the bears.On the other hand, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $36,457, it will suggest that traders accumulated at lower levels. The pair may then rise to the 50-simple moving average and later to the $41,330 to $42,451.67 resistance zone. A breakout of this zone will suggest that the correction is over.Cardano (ADA) has been trading between $1.33 and $1.94 for the past few days. The rebound off the support on June 12 fizzled out at the 20-day EMA ($1.52) on June 15, indicating the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies.The bears will now try to sink the price below the $1.33 to $1.24 support zone. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could slump to the critical support at $1. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 42 suggest that bears are in control.On the contrary, if the bulls again defend the support zone, it will suggest demand at lower levels. That could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days. A breakout and close above $1.94 will indicate that bulls are back in command.The 4-hour chart shows the bears pulled the price below the $1.33 support today but the failure to sustain the lower levels suggests accumulation on dips. The buyers will now try to propel the price above the downtrend line.If they succeed, it will invalidate the bearish pattern. Such a move could catch the aggressive bears off guard and result in a short squeeze that may propel the price to $1.74 and then $1.88.Alternatively, if the price turns down and sustains below $1.33, the pair will complete the descending triangle pattern. This bearish setup has a target objective at $0.78.The bulls pushed THETA above the resistance line of the descending channel on June 17 but they could not cross the hurdle at $10.47. This shows that bears have not thrown in the towel yet and are attempting to fake the breakouts.The price has dipped below the 20-day EMA ($8.65) today, suggesting that the short-term trend has turned in favor of the bears. However, the bulls are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the decline at $7.33.If the price rebounds off this support and rises above the moving averages, it will indicate strong demand at lower levels. The buyers will then make one more attempt to clear the hurdle at $10.47.If they succeed, the THETA/USDT pair could start a rally to $13.20. This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $7.37. Such a move could result in a decline to $6 and then to $4.57.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a head and shoulders pattern. This setup has a target objective at $7.02.However, the bulls are trying to push the price back above the neckline. If they do that, the short-term bears who may have initiated short positions on the break of the neckline may get trapped.This could result in short covering and the pair may rally to $9.19. A break above this resistance may open the doors for a rally to $10.10 and then $10.47.Monero (XMR) turned down from the downtrend line on June 19 and the bears will now try to sink the price to the support at $225. This is an important support to watch out for because the bulls have repeatedly defended this level in the past few days.If the price rebounds off $225, buyers will make one more attempt to drive the price above the downtrend line. If they do that, the XMR/USDT pair may challenge the 50-day SMA ($312) and then rise to $347.Contrary to this assumption, if bears sink the price below the $225 support, the pair will complete a descending triangle pattern. This bearish setup could attract further selling, resulting in a drop to $175 and then $124.69.The 4-hour chart shows that bulls made several attempts to push and sustain the price above the $283 resistance but failed. This shows that the bears are defending this level aggressively.The sellers pulled the price below the trendline of the ascending triangle today, but they could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests strong buying on dips. The bulls will now try to push the price above the moving averages and challenge the $283 resistance.If buyers can thrust the price above this level, the ascending triangle pattern will complete and the pair could rally to $316.23 and then to the pattern target at $341.This positive view will invalidate if bears sink and sustain the price below the trendline. Such a move could open the doors for a drop to $225.Amp broke above the stiff overhead resistance at $0.076 on June 14 and hit an all-time high at $0.12 on June 16. However, profit-booking on June 17 has started a correction that has dropped to the breakout level at $0.076.If bulls flip the $0.076 level to support, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and traders are accumulating on dips. The buyers will then try to push the price back toward the all-time high at $0.12.A breakout and close above this resistance will suggest the resumption of the uptrend. The AMP/USDT pair could then rally to $0.185.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $0.076, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.07), which may again act as a strong support. However, if this support cracks, the pair could decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.05)The correction from the all-time high was arrested at the $0.076 support as the bulls defended the level aggressively. However, the buyers are struggling to push the price above the $0.095 resistance, indicating that bears are selling at higher levels.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 50-SMA and form a higher low in the short term. If they succeed, the pair may rise to $0.095. A breakout and close above this resistance could open the doors for a rally to the all-time high. This positive view will invalidate if the pair breaks and closes below $0.076.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

453,"Bitcoin (BTC) could trade at an eye-watering $450,000 by the end of 2021, while $135,000 would be the “worst-case scenario”That’s according to analyst PlanB, who on Sunday released his latest sentiment-busting bullish BTC price prognosis.Well known as the creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price forecasting models, PlanB has repeatedly bucked the overall market mood in recent weeks and months.Even as BTC/USD sees multiple retests of lows from months past, the analyst — and his models — remain firmly fixed on a far brighter mid-term goal for the largest cryptocurrency.Now, even the “worst-case scenario” for Bitcoin would still see it trade at $47,000 in August. A slight reversal in September places the minimum target at $43,000 for that month only to be followed by $63,000 in October — near current all-time highs.Things then heat up, with $98,000 on the cards in November and a giant $135,000 by the end of the year.As such, Bitcoin is still four months from rematching its all-time high — a prediction that nonetheless beats some bearish models currently circulating from traders. These include Josh Rager, who this week claimed that $64,500 may well have been this price cycle’s top — something PlanB has specifically renounced on multiple occasions.“Wait until you seen my base case and best case scenarios! OK, a hint: best case Dec $450K,” he added in comments about what Bitcoin could be capable of in 2021.As Cointelegraph reported, meanwhile, the weekend is seeing problematic moves by Bitcoin.Sunday’s low stood at $33,337 on Bitstamp at the time of writing, with BTC/USD shedding 5% on the day and reversing most of the previous week’s gains.Calls for a further leg down are growing from various sources, with Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, being the latest high-profile voice going short.“Biggest bubble in world history getting bigger,” he warned about the overall macro market climate on Saturday.Such an event would echo March 2020, with commentators continuing to note the constant all-time highs on equities markets regardless of noise from central banks."
454,"Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to local lows of $33,750 on Sunday as fears over weak support levels proved to be well-founded. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD swiftly dropping below $34,000 on Sunday after choppy behavior at the start of the weekend.A comedown from resistance at near $40,000 continued to unfold, with low volumes highlighting little interest in protecting price action much above $30,000.Orderbook data from Binance confirmed this on the day, with sellers eradicating a major buy wall above $36,500 to leave the next significant support level at just $31,000.Among traders, talk mostly revolved around the so-called “death cross” on the BTC/USD daily and hourly charts, which occurred on Friday. This refers to the 50-day moving average crossing over the 200-day moving average, and it is traditionally considered to be a bad omen for price stability.Historically, not all death crosses have resulted in losses — as Cointelegraph reported, some are followed by bullish phases.“A death cross is overrated,” popular trader Crypto Ed summarized earlier in the week.In a separate commentary, Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, likewise took Twitter users to task over the negative skew given to death cross events.At the time of writing, however, Bitcoin nonetheless traded down 5% on the day, while three-day losses totaled over 14%.Liquidations were mounting on exchanges, with almost $150 million of positions gone in just a single hour after a flash dip of around $800.Another theory about price direction involved an impending “unlocking” phase at institutional giant Grayscale.As Cointelegraph previously noted, the coming weeks will see a large chunk of investor funds released after a six-month lock-up period, with the potential for selling pressure to therefore increase as accredited investors seek to offset some of their losses (realized after selling their GBTC shares) by selling BTC on the spot market.“Between mid-April 2021 to today there have been 139.5K BTC (GBTC) in unlockings,” explained Decentrader analyst Tonald Dusk.Thereafter, by contrast, there should be a reduction in potential sell-side activity after the summer — at least from GBTC — if these unlockings have indeed put downward pressure on price since the mid-April all-time highs.A look at network fundamentals, meanwhile, gave additional cause for concern. The hash rate, already in flux thanks to shifts in miner distribution, fell below 100 exahashes per second (EH/s), having previously hit a peak of 168 EH/s.Related: Bitcoin may lose $30K price level if stocks tank, analysts warnOther estimates, while not exact, also depicted the hash rate downtrend.Difficulty, fresh from two consecutive downward adjustments, was on track for a third leg down of around 9.7% at the next in around nine days’ time.The last time that Bitcoin saw three downward difficulty adjustments in a row was during the capitulation phase of the previous bear market in late 2018."
455,"As nonfungible token (NFT) art continues to develop as an industry, a new trend is quickly emerging: physical NFT galleries featuring digital, nonfungible pieces of unique artwork. Most recently, the largest Bitcoin (BTC) event in history — the Bitcoin 2021 conference — featured a peer-to-peer pop-up NFT art gallery with artwork from over 30 different crypto artists. Teodora Atanasova, VIP relations manager and founding team member of Nexo — the company that backed the Bitcoin Art Gallery — told Cointelegraph that over 100 pieces of art were sold during the two-day conference: ""This demonstrates the impact physical NFT galleries can have on both the traditional art world and the crypto industry."" She added: ""We need to bring crypto to people's eyes and touch.""Popular crypto-friendly cities like Miami are not the only places where NFT art galleries are appearing. Earlier this month, an NFT art gallery pop-up took place in Dallas, TX for the first time. The event was hosted by Artist Uprising, a Dallas-based talent agency for creatives, and featured several individual art pieces by breakout NFT artists who have collectively grossed over $1 million in online digital art sales in the last month alone.Merrick Porchéddu, CEO of Artist Uprising, told Cointelegraph that the event attracted over 200 attendees, with NFT sales still ongoing in open auctions:Yet while physical NFT art galleries are a notable step for the crypto industry, some art aficionados, or traditionalists, may question the importance of, or even the necessity of, NFT art galleries in the real world.For instance, an article in The Art Newspaper quotes Saskia Draxler, co-owner of German art gallery Galerie Nagel Draxler, who noted that the digital artist Beeple — who auctioned off a piece of NFT art at auction house Christie’s for over $69 million — will most likely not impact art history. She added that ""NFTs will not replace physical art any more than NFTs from a Nike sneaker will replace real sneakers.""Related: NFT 'art revolution': Beeple on his 5,040-day labor of loveWhile this is just one opinion, some believe that the confusion around NFTs and the need for physical galleries may stem from a lack of understanding. Carrie Eldridge, founder and CEO of ATO Platform — an asset management service providing royalties to artists, galleries and nonprofits — told Cointelegraph that there are many pragmatists and conservatives who are not ready to embrace NFTs as a legitimate medium. ""They also don’t believe that NFTs provide a solution to challenges that have plagued artists for generations, like value tracking, royalty collection, collector analytics, value appreciation for collectors and insurance companies and many more complex issues,"" she said.Although this may be the case, Eldridge noted that it’s important to consider perspectives from both traditional collectors and the crypto community when it comes to NFT art: ""At ATO we are enthusiastic about the innovation and at the same time, are vigilant and protective of the art industry and those who have toiled for decades to make it what it is today.""While Eldridge brings up a valid argument, it’s important to point out the reason that physical NFT galleries have appeared in the first place. While some may think that these venues opened simply as a result of lifted COVID-19 restrictions, industry experts beg to differ.For example, Marc Billings, founder of Blackdove — the company that launched Miami’s first NFT art gallery earlier in June — told Cointelegraph that NFT art galleries are no different than traditional galleries in form and function. However, he noted that traditional art galleries have failed to meet the needs of the NFT artist, both in terms of technology and collector interest, thereby opening the door to dedicated NFT galleries. Billings said:In addition to digital NFT artwork being displayed in real-world spaces, NFT artists have also started to create physical pieces that are associated with their digital creations. Not only do physical NFT art galleries allow these pieces to be displayed, but they also help attract interest from the mainstream.For instance, NFT artist Taylor Good — also known as ""Warhodl"" — told Cointelegraph that by creating physical soup cans tied to digital NFTs, his pop-up at Bitcoin 2021 attracted collectors who were new to the NFT space.Echoing Good, crypto artist Sergey Gordienko — also known as ""Do What You Love Artist"" — told Cointelegraph that he is offering physical pieces of NFT art to traditional collectors along with their digital versions. ""I think this brings additional value to the physical art piece,"" he said.While it’s important to recognize the necessity of physical NFT galleries, Billings also pointed out that blockchain technology plays an important role in the overall ecosystem: ""Blockchain allows the hard work of the various members of the community to be recognized and compensated accordingly.""Indeed, blockchain is one of the most important features behind NFTs in general, as it has created an entirely new financial model for these assets. This has enabled creatives to achieve a larger portion of profits, as value is exchanged across a blockchain network. In addition, proof of ownership is achieved for collectors because all transactions are conducted and recorded on the blockchain.Good explained that NFT art has allowed him to receive profits in real time, instead of waiting for galleries to accept, price and then sell the item:Moreover, the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave is currently working on developing a platform to use NFTs as collateral. Jordan Lazaro Gustave, chief operating officer of Aave, told Cointelegraph that the company views NFTs as a store of value, typically in the form of artwork. He noted that Aave plans to use NFT art as collateral, similar to the way a bank would offer a credit line to someone wanting to purchase a piece of fine art.Related: Digital turns physical: Top NFT galleries to visit in-person in 2021While Lazaro Gustave couldn’t reveal the full details of the platform in development, he noted that traditionally in the DeFi space, fungible assets like stablecoins are used as collateral. However, he pointed out that NFTs are nonfungible, and that Aave has developed a way to use NFTs as collateral at scale.While the benefits provided by physical NFT galleries are evident, it’s unclear whether these dedicated spaces will continue to emerge across the world — or will die down as the NFT art hype fades.Porchéddu explained that while he initially thought NFT art was a bubble that was going to pop soon, he now believes it is a trend that will morph and stay, adding: ""People are getting incredibly innovative and approaching this in a unique way where they're providing solutions to problems.""Billings further remarked that there is no traditional gallery that can keep up with the technological innovation coming from the NFT art space. Echoing Billings, Eldridge commented that NFT art is not a revolution but an evolution of an old standing art form: digital art. He said:"
456,"Ether (ETH) price outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) by 173% from March 28 to May 15. The incredible bull caused the token to reach a $4,380 all-time high. However, as cryptocurrency markets initiated a sharp drop on May 12, the trend started to reverse, and since then, Ether has underperformed by 25%.Some might say it is a technical adjustment after a strong rally. While this partially explains the move, it excludes some critical factors, including the fast advance of smart-contract network competitors and Bitcoin being adopted as an official currency for the first time.Notice how the ETH/BTC ratio rallied again on June 8, reaching 0.77 despite Ether's price remaining 36% below its all-time high and ranging near $2,800. To understand what could have been driving the ratio, analysts need to analyze Ether and Bitcoin price drivers separately.Ether's bull run potentially got an extra leg due to intense praise from institutional investors. Traders could have picked up a sense of urgency, known as FOMO, and promptly shifted their Bitcoin exposure towards the leading altcoin.On May 13, New Yorker magazine published an interview with Mike Novogratz, the founder, and CEO of Galaxy Digital. In the conversation, Novogratz said:Novogratz was then questioned on how much higher Ether could reach, to which he answered:While an Ethereum holder might have interpreted it as a prediction, others could have understood it as a wild guess, likely depending on general crypto market conditions.However, roughly a week later, a report from Goldman Sachs revealed the global investment bank believed that Ether had a ""high chance of overtaking Bitcoin as a dominant store of value."" Interestingly, one of the main quotes in the report was directly from Novogratz's interview with the New Yorker.While Ethereum has kept its 80% dominance on net value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has reached a 40% market share on DEX exchanges.The successful growth of the DeFi industry and non fungible token (NFT) markets caused intense congestion on the Ethereum network, raising median fees to $37 in mid-May. That bottleneck triggered an activity exodus to competing networks, and PancakeSwap was best positioned to capture that flow.Related: Here's why one analyst says Bitcoin will outperform Ethereum in the short termTo make things worse, important DeFi projects expanded to Binance Smart Chain, including yield aggregator Harvest Finance and decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch. Investors quickly realized that the trend could continue as the competing smart-contract network provided an easy solution for dApps looking for cheaper alternatives.Bitcoin might have had a subpar performance over the past 30 days because it has failed to break the $42,000 resistance multiple times. However, a major milestone was achieved when El Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender on June 12.After the Central American country made the decision law, a handful of other Central and South American countries began discussing the advantages of taking a similar path.Ethereum is undertaking a redesign that will change the issuing rate and how entities get paid to secure the network by moving away from the Proof of Work model. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is making sure that every upgrade is backward-compatible and maintaining its strict monetary policy.That is the main reason why Ether will not outperform Bitcoin over the next 12 months, or at least until there's a better understanding of how Ethereum network dominance of smart contracts will be.Professional investors avoid uncertainties at all costs, and cryptocurrency markets already present plenty of that. There's just no reason for institutional investors to ignore the risks while competing networks eat Ethereum's lunch.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

457,"At the moment, there seems to be a general assumption that when the U.S. dollar value increases against other global major currencies, as measured by the DXY index, the impact on Bitcoin (BTC) is negative.For the past few weeks, analysts and influencers have been issuing alerts about this inverse correlation, which held true until March 2021.So I guess we're not all obsessed with $DXY anymore? Because it's looking super bullish & had provided an almost perfect inverse correlation for over a year. Either way we're about to find out if $BTC has matured to the point of being uncorrelated. ️ #Banks #Brrrr #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/gequzmr6p2What could be the trigger of #Bitcoin top? A #DXY bottom! And we may just have that around the corner! https://t.co/1Cy03QuMgb pic.twitter.com/zKUh9CWc72However, no matter if you track a 20-day or 60-day correlation, the situation reversed over the past three months.The correlation indicator (red) has been ranging above 50% since mid-March, indicating that both DXY and Bitcoin have generally followed a similar trend.As Cointelegraph reported, May's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation hitting a 13-year high, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that inflation could run higher than planned in the short term. Still, he clarified that ""longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal.""The market gave the Fed a 'vote of confidence,' causing the U.S. dollar to appreciate versus major global currencies. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dropped 8% to a $35,300 low on June 18, further reinforcing the inverse correlation thesis.Related: Forget Elon, here's why Bitcoin traders should be watching the U.S. Dollar Index insteadEven though pundits and influencers love to dissect those events and extrapolate 1-day movements, one should analyze a more extended timeframe to understand the potential impacts of the DXY index on the Bitcoin price.Notice how both markers weakened during May, after a relatively flat period in late April. It seems premature, at least, to call the recent decoupling an inverse correlation. Multiple forces could be behind Bitcoin's failure to sustain a $40,000 support on June 16 and the subsequent price correction.For starters, Liu He, Vice Premier of China and a member of the all-powerful eight-person politburo, led a meeting on preventing and controlling financial risks on May 24. Among the decisions was a crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading activities.Bitcoin's hash rate dropped to the lowest level since November 2020 as miners are starting to move away from China. Huobi temporarily suspended futures trading to Chinese users, while Futures platform Bybit revealed it would have closed accounts registered with Chinese phone numbers.Furthermore, on May 26, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said the regulators are looking forward to working with fellow regulators and Congress to fill gaps in investor protection in crypto markets.Therefore, the potential U.S. regulation and the current China crackdown on mining and trading activities seem vital to Bitcoin's recent underperformance. Once those issues are no longer threats, the gap that has been created from DXY's positive move could fade away.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

458,"The ghost of stock market crash is back again to haunt Bitcoin (BTC).It happened last in March 2020. Back then, the prospect of the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic led to lockdowns across developed and emerging economies. In turn, global stocks crashed in tandem, and Bitcoin lost half of its value in just two days.Meanwhile, the U.S .dollar index, or DXY, which represents the greenback's strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, has now climbed by 8.78% to 102.992, its highest level since January 2017.The huge inverse correlation showed that investors dumped their stocks and Bitcoin holdings and sought safety in what they thought was a better haven: the greenback. More than a year later, Bitcoin and stock markets again wrestle with a similar bearish sentiment, this time led by a renewed demand for the U.S. dollar following the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone.Namely, the U.S. central bank announced Wednesday it will start hiking its benchmark interest rates by the end of 2023, a year earlier than planned.Lower interest rates helped to pull Bitcoin and the U.S. stock market out of their bearish slumber. The benchmark cryptocurrency jumped from $3,858 in March 2020 to almost $65,000 in April 2021 as the Fed pushed lending rates to the 0%-0.25% range.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index rose more than 95% to 4,257.16 from its mid-March 2020 peak. Dow Jones and Nasdaq rallied similarly, as shown in the chart below.And this is what happened after the Federal Reserve's rate-hike announcement on Wednesday...Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index jumped to its two-month high, hinting at a renewed appetite for the greenback in global markets.Popular on-chain analyst Willy Woo said on Friday that a stock market crash coupled with a rising dollar could increase Bitcoin's bearish outlook. ""Some downside risk if stonks tank, a lot of rallying in the DXY (USD strength) which is typical of money moving to safety,"" he explained. Michael Burry, the head of Scion Asset Management, also sounded the alarm on an imminent Bitcoin and stock market crash, adding that when crypto markets fall from trillions, or when meme stocks fall from billions, the Main Street losses will approach the size of countries.""The problem with crypto, as in most things, is the leverage,"" he tweeted. ""If you don't know how much leverage is in crypto, you don't know anything about crypto.""Burry deleted his tweets later.Away from the price action, Bitcoin's adoption continues to grow, an upside catalyst that was missing during the March 2020 crash.On Friday, CNBC reported that Goldman Sachs has started trading Bitcoin Futures with Galaxy Digital, a crypto merchant bank headed by former hedge fund tycoon Mike Novogratz. The financial news service claimed that Goldman's call to hire Galaxy as its liquidity provider came in response to increasing pressure from its wealthy clients.Related: Hawkish Fed comments push Bitcoin price and stocks lower againDamien Vanderwilt, co-president of Galaxy Digital, added that the mainstream adoption would help Bitcoin lower its infamous price volatility, paving the way for institutional players to join the crypto bandwagon. Excerpts from his interview with CNBC:Earlier, other major financial and banking services, including Morgan Stanley, PayPal, and Bank of New York Mellon, also launched crypto-enabled services for their clients.Referring to the question ""are we in a bear market?"" Woo said that Bitcoin adoption continues to look healthy despite the recent price drop. The analyst cited on-chain indicators to show an increasing user growth and capital injection in the Bitcoin market.Of primary interest is capital rotation from stablecoins back into the crypto markets (I'll say that's mainly BTC since alt coins are reducing in dominance).

459,"Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider financial markets faced a new wave of selling on June 18 following comments from James Bullard, the president of the United States Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, indicating that he expects the first interest rate increase to happen in late 2022. Bullard's comments were even more hawkish than Wednesday’s comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who indicated that the rate hikes would come in 2023. Powell's comments triggered a sell-off across financial markets as the U.S. dollar gained strength.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that as the dollar was strengthening, Bitcoin bulls were overwhelmed by sellers, triggering a decline to a daily low at $35,129.The uniform sell-off across a variety of assets including stocks, gold and cryptocurrencies has further eaten away at the narrative that Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset, as data shows that BTC's correlation with both gold and stocks has continued to increase throughout 2021.Friday's close in traditional markets marked one of the worst weeks for the Dow since October after the index saw five straight sessions of losses for a total decline of 3% this week.The S&P 500 and NASDAQ were also hard hit on Friday, closing the day down 1.31% and 0.92% respectively, while the 10-year treasury note fell by 4.04% in response to the strengthening dollar.As for the cause behind the recent hawkish stance from the Fed, Bullard pointed to a higher than expected level of inflation as the economy reopens following the Covid-19 lockdowns.Bullard said:Bullard suggested that in the future, inflation is  ""running at 3% this year and 2.5% in 2022 before drifting back down to the Fed’s 2% target.”Altcoins saw their prices decline alongside Bitcoin on Friday as traders once again fled to the safety of stablecoins as market volatility picked up.Ether (ETH) saw its price slide more than 13% to reach a low at $2,137 and Amp (AMP) fell 33% from its all-time high of $0.1211 that was established on June 16.Related: Bulls hesitate to buy the dip after Bitcoin price falls close to $35KOf the top 200 coins, the two best performances of the day were ZKSwap (ZKS) with a 14% gain Gnosis (GNO) which rallied by 7.4%.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.486 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 44.8%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

A spike in BTC inflows to exchanges occurred on June 15 when BTC price hit $41,300 and then proceeded to decline by 15% over the next three days.One observant analyst has pointed out that whale activity on the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, in particular, has a noticeable correlation with some of the larger sell-offs experienced by the cryptocurrency market in 2021.#Gemini is a whale pod for #BTC.

According to crypto Twitter analyst William Clemente III, recent on-chain data indicates that BTC is oversold and “now sits on historically important inflection points for major on-chain indicators.” Clemente suggested that long-term holders “continue to scoop up discounted BTC,” which has helped offset selling by short-term holders and he pointed to the fact that “accumulation is growing stronger.”Overall, the short-term future for BTC remains risky as previous instances of a death-cross have been followed by a retracement that is similar “to the retrace that preceded the crossover,” according to cryptocurrency analyst and trader Rekt Capital.On the other hand, the longer-term data hints at a more optimistic future because whale wallets and long-term holders continue to increase their Bitcoin balances.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

461,"Cryptocurrency has gone through a number of bull and bear cycles since the industry’s inception in 2009. While 2017 saw the crypto industry boom around initial coin offerings and a rising Bitcoin (BTC) price, 2020 and 2021 have seen the crypto space expand around decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). This time however, retail and institutional interest in crypto have ushered in greater adoption than ever before, according to one crypto company CEO. “Cryptocurrencies have been growing steadily in popularity over the years, but 2017 left a bitter taste in a lot of people's mouths when the market took a swift downturn,” StormX CEO Simon Yu said in comments sent to Cointelegraph. “But fast forward to 2021 and it’s clear to see times have changed.”Yu crafted his quotes in response to recent findings from the Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, of the United Kingdom, which revealed 2.3 million U.K.-based adults own cryptocurrency, based on a survey.In 2017, Bitcoin’s price rallied to heights just shy of $20,000 per coin.

This shows the short-term sentiment has turned bearish and traders are closing their positions to hoard cash.This has also put brakes on Bitcoin’s (BTC) recovery. However, Pantera Capital chief executive Dan Morehead said in the monthly newsletter published on June 14 that Bitcoin has been “this “cheap” relative to its trend 20.3% of the past 11 years.”Related: Joining the ranks: Bitcoin’s correlation with gold and stocks is growingSantiment data shows that Bitcoin whales, holding between 100 and 10,000 Bitcoin, have been on a buying spree, lapping up about 90,000 Bitcoin in the past 25 days. They now hold about 48.7% of Bitcoin’s supply.Can the buying from the whales arrest the decline in Bitcoin and will the buying in altcoins resume? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin turned down from $41,330 on June 15 and the selling has dragged the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($38,060) today. This suggests the short-term recovery may have ended and the bears will now try to sink the price to $34,600.36 and then $31,000.The relative strength index (RSI) has turned down from the overhead resistance at 55 and dropped into the negative territory, indicating the bears have the upper hand.However, if the BTC/USDT pair rebounds off the $31,000 support, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. That may keep the pair range-bound between $31,000 and $42,451.67 for the next few days.The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $42,451.67 to indicate that the downtrend may have ended. On the other hand, a break below $31,000 will suggest the resumption of the next leg of the downtrend.Ether (ETH) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($2,528) on June 15 and the bears have pulled the price below the support line of the symmetrical triangle today. This suggests that supply exceeds demand.If the ETH/USDT pair breaks below $2,180, the next stop could be $2,079.94 and then $1,728.74. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside.This negative view will invalidate if the price rises from the current level or the support and breaks above the resistance line of the triangle. Such a move will suggest that bulls are back in command and a new uptrend is likely.Binance Coin (BNB) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($367) for the past few days. This suggests the sentiment remains negative and traders could be using the rallies to close their long positions.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI at 42 indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside. If bears sustain the price below the trendline, the selling may intensify and the BNB/USDT pair could drop to $257.40 and then $211.70.On the other hand, if bears fail to sustain the price below the trendline, the bulls will again try to push the pair above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could rally to the overhead resistance at $433.A breakout and close above this resistance will suggest the correction is over and the pair may start its journey to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $508.38.Cardano (ADA) turned down from the 50-day SMA ($1.62) on June 15, indicating that the bears are trying to dominate proceedings. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest advantage to the bears.The sellers will now try to pull the price to the $1.33 support. A break and close below this level will clear the path for a further fall to the next critical support at $1.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off $1.33, it will suggest that buyers are accumulating near this level. That could keep the ADA/USDT pair range-bound between $1.33 and $1.94 for the next few days.The bulls will gain the upper hand after the price breaks and closes above $1.94. Such a move could push the pair to the all-time high at $2.47.Dogecoin (DOGE) has failed to rebound off the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern in the past two days, which suggests a lack of demand at current levels. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.33) and the RSI below 41 suggest that bears have the upper hand.If the price sustains below the neckline, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to $0.21. The bulls may defend this support aggressively but if this level cracks, the selling may intensify and the pair could decline to $0.10.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off $0.21, the bulls will try to propel the price above the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair could rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.40) and then to $0.45.XRP continues to trade below the 20-day EMA ($0.91), suggesting a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears will now try to pull the price below the critical support at $0.75 while the bulls will try to defend the support.If the price rebounds off $0.75, the XRP/USDT pair could move up to the 20-day EMA. A breakout of this resistance could keep the pair range-bound between $0.75 and $1.07 for the next few days.However, the downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 39 indicate advantage to the bears. If the pair slips below $0.75, the next stop is likely to be $0.65. If this support cracks, the selling may intensify and the pair could drop to $0.56 and then to $0.43.Polkadot (DOT) turned down from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on June 15 and broke below the 20-day EMA ($23.57) on June 16. The altcoin has now dropped to the support line of the triangle.If the price rebounds off the support line, the DOT/USDT pair may continue to consolidate inside the triangle for a few more days. However, the downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest advantage to the bears.If bears sink and sustain the price below the triangle, it will suggest the resumption of the downtrend. The first support on the downside is $15. A break below this level could open the doors for a further fall to $8.The bulls will be back in the game after they push and sustain the price above the triangle. Such a move will signal that the correction may be over.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($24.16) on June 15, indicating selling on rallies. The bulls defended the $21.50 support on June 17 but the failure of the buyers to build upon the recovery shows a lack of demand at higher levels.If bears sink the price below $20, the selling may intensify and the UNI/USDT pair could drop to $16.49 and then to $13.04. Such a move will suggest that traders sold their positions in the recent recovery to $30.On the contrary, if the pair rebounds off the $20 support, it will suggest that bulls are accumulating on dips. The buyers will then attempt to drive the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair may rise to $30.The bulls attempted to defend the support line on June 17 but they could not push Litecoin’s (LTC) price above the 20-day EMA ($176). This suggests that bears are defending the 20-day EMA aggressively.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone indicate advantage to the bears. If sellers sustain the price below the support line, the LTC/USDT pair could start its journey toward the May 23 low at $118.03. If this support also gives way, the selling may intensify and the pair may plummet to $70.This negative view will invalidate if the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will be the first sign of strength. The pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($230). A break above this level will suggest that the downtrend may be over.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($648) on June 15, indicating that bears are selling on every minor rally. The price action of the past few days has formed a descending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close below $538.11.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 39 suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside. If bears sink and sustain the price below $538.11, the BCH/USDT pair could resume its down move. The pair could then drop to $400 and later to $370.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level or $538.11 and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest strong buying by the bulls. The pair could then rally to $800 and then to the 50-day SMA ($872).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

463,"Goldman Sachs has debuted a Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading product for its client in collaboration with crypto investment giant Galaxy Digital.According to CNBC, the move marks the first time the Wall Street bank has partnered with a digital asset-based liquidity provider. Galaxy Digital co-president Damien Vanderwilt said the company offered a gateway to the crypto space allowing a tightly regulated entity like Goldman to offer crypto-related investment products.Goldman will reportedly be offering CME Group Bitcoin futures for its clients, marking another expansion of its recently established crypto trading desk. The move follows swiftly on the heels of an earlier announcement by the bank about debuting Ether (ETH) futures and options.For Vanderwilt, Goldman offering BTC futures trading will help to onboard more institutional investors into the crypto investment space which the Galaxy executive argued will help to reduce price volatility.Vanderwilt also remarked that the move would serve as an example to other Wall Street banks that crypto exposure is possible.Indeed, as previously reported by Cointelegraph, the demand for crypto exposure appears to be growing on Wall Street with some banks recently announcing plans to establish trading desks for the novel asset class.Related: Goldman Sachs analysts divided over whether Bitcoin is an 'investable asset class'Max Minton, Goldman Sachs head of digital assets for the Asia-Pacific region stated that offering Bitcoin futures trading was part of the banks’ goal of providing access to its clients’ preferred assets, adding:Despite the impending announcement from the bank, several Goldman figures are still reportedly not sold on Bitcoin as an “investable asset class.” Earlier in June, the bank’s commodities chief argued that BTC was more similar to a “risk-on” asset like copper rather than an inflation hedge like gold."
464,"Bitcoin (BTC) broke below $37,000 during trading on June 18 in the latest short-term bearish sign for hodlers.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as it hit new local lows of $36,540 on Bitstamp. After repeatedly testing the $37,000, the pair finally broke through to see short-term volatility return and swings of several hundred dollars up and down.The move could be significant as it removes the majority of a large buy wall which was previously in place above $36,500. ""Expecting a bounce (not sure if it will be THE bounce) around 36k,"" popular trader Crypto Ed summarized in his latest Twitter update following the lows.As Cointelegraph reported, BTC traders are at something of a crossroads under current conditions amid a lack of overall market direction. Indicators also present a mixed picture.Mainstream adoption announcements from the likes of Goldman Sachs and Spanish banking giant BBVA likewise failed to lift the mood, with Goldman analysts characterizing the situation with mixed statements on Bitcoin's true merit.Altcoins meanwhile felt the pinch from Bitcoin's troubles, with many of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap seeing 6% daily losses or more.Related: Traders search for bearish signals after Bitcoin futures enter backwardationEther (ETH) was below $2,250 at the time of writing, down 6.6% on the day, while Flexa's AMP, previously the standout high flyer, was the day's worst performer with 23% losses.""Some of these altcoins look ready to lose another 50%,"" Twitter accountTyler Durden said in a grim market prognosis."
465,"Bitcoin (BTC) is an uncorrelated asset, or so the narrative used to go. For much of Bitcoin’s lifetime, it existed as something of value to a very small group of people. Now, awareness and demand are accelerating rapidly. So, what does this mean for the status of BTC as a supposedly uncorrelated asset? That Bitcoin was an uncorrelated asset isn’t just conjecture — the numbers back it up. According to data compiled by VanEck in early 2021, there was almost no discernible pattern between the movements of Bitcoin and other markets, including S&P 500, bonds, gold, real estate and others, for the period 2013 to 2019.But as the chart below shows, there has been an evident shift in correlation patterns across various asset classes since 2020, most notably, the stock markets and gold.Furthermore, according to data compiled by Singaporean bank DBS, Bitcoin’s correlation to the stock markets continues to increase throughout 2021.It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s increasing correlation with both stocks and gold isn’t an anomaly. These markets are generally considered to have an inverse relationship thanks to gold’s status as a hedging instrument during periods of stock market volatility. However, no doubt in part thanks to the market turmoil caused by macroeconomic factors, both stocks and gold have been in generally bullish markets for most of 2020 and 2021.This pattern explains how BTC can show a correlation to both assets. However, the narrative that Bitcoin could be most closely correlated to gold appears to be on increasingly shaky ground. To begin with, this theory was only ever based on the notion that investors may treat BTC as a store of value in the event of a wider market downturn, affording it the same “safe haven” status as gold. However, for much of Bitcoin’s lifetime, it had existed during times of economic prosperity, at least in the more advanced economies, so the theory had never been tested.TD Ameritrade analyst Oliver Renick has argued that BTC is far more correlated to macroeconomic events than gold. The Goldman Sachs head of commodities research recently went on record to state that Bitcoin is more like “digital copper” than digital gold. His position is that Bitcoin behaves more like copper as a “risk-on” asset, whereas gold serves as a “risk-off” hedge.Brandon Dallmann, chief marketing officer of exchange ecosystem operator Unizen, thinks Bitcoin is not a gold-like asset, telling Cointelegraph: “Bitcoin’s current volatility indeed prevents it from being a stable store of value. Also, gold’s price tends to rise when other assets depreciate, and Bitcoin doesn’t show such a stable up-down trend.”However, it may not necessarily be a positive development for volatility-seekers if Bitcoin does take on gold-like properties since its trading potential will surely decrease.Recently, market demand appeared to indicate a more negative correlation between Bitcoin and gold. The May sell-off in the crypto markets could have prompted fleeing investors to go on a yellow metal buying spree.Bitcoin’s correlation with the stock markets appears to be taking a different turn. Events over the last 18 months or so have given further credence to the argument that Bitcoin is correlated to the stock markets and that the bond could be becoming stronger. In March 2020, when the stock markets started to fall amid widespread uncertainty regarding COVID-19, a cryptocurrency Black Thursday rapidly followed.More recently, Bitcoin’s volatile price action could be associated with investor uncertainty regarding tech stocks. Barry Silbert has also tweeted his belief that the crypto markets are correlated to stocks.There are several factors explaining why Bitcoin appears to be increasingly tied to the stock markets. Firstly, the meme stocks movement that started with GameStop in February, and more recently reemerged around AMC shares, has caused waves in the world of stock trading. The emergence of a new generation of digital-savvy investors who bridge the gap between crypto and stocks could explain why there’s an increasing correlation between the two assets.However, another critical factor must be the inflow of institutional funds to crypto. While the “uncorrelated” argument held water while crypto was dominated by retail investors, it’s increasingly no longer the case. Logically, if it gets to a point where both markets consist of the same participants, the correlation becomes inevitable.Related: GameStop inadvertently paves the way for decentralized financeThis pattern of correlation also makes sense when drilling down into the correlation data to the level of indexes or even individual company stocks. While Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes is relatively low at 0.2, Bitcoin-invested firms show a far higher correlation, with Tesla around 0.55, MicroStrategy above 0.7, and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust above 0.8.Extrapolating what this could mean if the institutional trend continues, it seems plausible that Bitcoin’s correlation to the stock market will continue to increase as long as firms want to hold BTC on their balance sheets. However, Igneus Terrenus, head of communication at Bybit Exchange, believes that it will take a long time before that happens, telling Cointelegraph:Correlation isn’t causation, and Bitcoin’s relationship with the stock market isn’t one-way. While events in the stock markets could cause BTC market movements, could the opposite also be true? It seems likely, particularly as institutional interest in BTC continues. The flagship cryptocurrency would become more exposed to macroeconomic factors than it was during its cypherpunk days.Still, Bitcoin has its own market forces at play, and these could ultimately influence the global stock markets if the value of corporate balance sheets fluctuates. For instance, Bitcoin’s halving events have a compelling link with its price cycles. Daniele Bernardi, CEO of fintech management company Diaman Partners, believes that BTC’s own price cycles will override the influence of institutional investors, telling Cointelegraph:It’s also worth remembering that externalities, such as electricity prices, availability and cost of mining equipment, and regulatory developments all impact Bitcoin’s price.So, it seems unlikely that many firms would adopt the same enthusiastic attitude to BTC investing as MicroStrategy and would likely take a more prudent and diversified path should they invest in crypto. However, the idea of a power cut in Xinjiang, which could wipe trillions off the S&P 500, could be a little daunting.Another intriguing consideration is what would happen to the rest of the cryptocurrency markets should Bitcoin become more closely tied to the stock markets. So far, the crypto markets generally follow Bitcoin’s lead, although there may be odd exceptions.However, institutional interest in cryptocurrencies doesn’t necessarily extend very far down the crypto ranking tables. Therefore, would it be possible to see a future where price movements in altcoin markets are less correlated with Bitcoin, thanks to an investor base split between individuals and institutions?Related: Bullish all the way? MicroStrategy doubles down on its Bitcoin betThe shift in investor profile, even if it’s only just starting, is the most straightforward explanation for why BTC isn’t necessarily always performing in the same way as it has during previous halving cycles.Of course, there could be other factors at play. Regardless of what the future holds, it now seems inarguable that BTC is inextricably linked to the global markets in a way that’s unprecedented during its lifetime."
466,"China's crackdown on Bitcoin (BTC) mining may have unintended benefits for BTC price action, one analyst suggests.In a tweet on June 18, Charles Edwards, CEO of investment firm Capriole, argued that the Chinese miner exodus was already lowering Bitcoin's potential price floor.As a shake-up sees Bitcoin hashing power redistributed away from China, Bitcoin's electrical cost — the combined cost of keeping the network running — is dropping.As Edwards notes, this ""Bitcoin production cost"" is very rarely crossed by spot price. In becoming lower itself, the indicator thus opens up the possibility of another price dip, one which nonetheless has been followed by bull runs in the past.""Don't believe it: China mining fud is not healthy for Bitcoin,"" he commented on an accompanying chart of Bitcoin production cost.Looking at historical performance, similarities to 2017 are immediately apparent. During that year, Bitcoin saw a run to two local peaks with a significant retracement in between. That event also witnessed spot price dipping below the upper production cost boundary.As Cointelegraph reported, seasoned Bitcoiners have complained about the spin given to changes in China's mining scene, which has often been flatly negative.They point out that Bitcoin is not dependent on Chinese miners, and that a redistribution of hashing activity will naturally follow as the network seeks ever more efficient ways of expanding.Related: Miami mayor offers city's clean nuclear power to Chinese Bitcoin miners""The Chinese crackdown on mining is a tragedy for China, a nuisance for Bitcoin, and a windfall for North American Bitcoin miners,"" Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, summarized on Thursday.He was responding to news that mining company Bitfarms will shortly debut on Nasdaq, in so doing becoming the largest publicly-traded miner in North America.

468,"Bitcoin (BTC) suffered as investors moved a record amount of cash in Federal Reserve's overnight facility after the central bank started paying interest on the money.The U.S. central bank received $756 billion via its reverse repurchase program from nearly 70 market participants on Thursday. The stash is about $172B higher than the one deposited last week and roughly $235B more than on Wednesday, wherein only 53 investors tapped the facility.A reverse repo facility takes in cash majorly from money-market funds and government-sponsored banks. Until Wednesday, the service offered eligible users a return interest of zero percent.But after the Federal Reserve signaled faster and sooner interest rate increases — in 2023 instead of previously anticipated 2024, the facility moved its revere repo rate up to 0.05% and interests on excess reserves rates, which banks deposit 0.15% from 0.10%.Primarily due to quantitative easing for the U.S. economy, excessive dollar liquidity has been pouring into money market funds that later invest this in short-term government securities. Higher demand for those securities has often sent their yields into negative territories.Negative-yielding securities in response to Fed's quantitative easing turned out to be one of the major bullish catalysts for Bitcoin and other digital assets since March 2020. Against traditional debts, the cryptocurrency sector promised better returns and, in some cases, consistent yields from the emerging decentralized finance industry.But with Fed throwing a curveball at the markets with its hawkish tones, mainstream investors have been turning to facilities that seem less risky than Bitcoin or gold and promise a decent yield. As a result, the Fed's repo market records its most enormous inbound cash flow.""We appear to be seeing a growing inversely proportional correlation between the price of Bitcoin and the Reverse Repo market from the Fed,"" said Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at crypto wallet service Mercuryo.

Nevertheless, the macroeconomic analyst stressed that the Fed-led tapering woes wouldn't hurt alternative hedging assets like Bitcoin and gold in the long run.Related: Diversification into Bitcoin a ‘prudent move,’ says Bloomberg strategistHe noted that the U.S. government tends to push through more stimulus packages that expand the Fed balance sheets. That means the central bank keeps buying the sovereign debt, thereby pushing bond yields lower. Pal said:The analyst added that the dollar's recovery trend would stabilize in the second half of 2021. Eventually, the capital would start flowing back into gold and crypto markets."
469,"With Bitcoin (BTC) mining concentration expanding in North America, Miami mayor Francis Suarez is looking to position his city as a hub for crypto mining activity.Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, Mayor Suarez said he is inviting foreign mining companies to consider establishing data centers in the city.According to Suarez, Miami’s ample nuclear electricity supply should attract Bitcoin miners looking to adopt clean energy sources for their operations, especially amid the current spotlight on the supposed carbon footprint of crypto mining.Mayor Suarez has previously weighed in on the issue claiming back in March that 90% of Bitcoin mining was from “dirty energy.”At the time, the Miami mayor argued that a shift in mining concentration to the United States may help to ease environmental concerns.As part of efforts to attract overseas Bitcoin miners, Mayor Suarez stated that city officials were looking to reduce the cost of energy in conjunction with the power companies. Other incentives like favorable taxes and minimal regulations are also on the table, according to the Miami mayor.By using cheap, clean energy and crypto-friendly regulations, Miami may compete with other emerging mining destinations in Texas and Wyoming.The plan may also further expand Miami’s crypto adoption drive with the city looking to become the Bitcoin and crypto capital of the world.Mayor Suarez is himself a crypto proponent and has said previously that he owns both Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).

Woo describes NVT signal as a ""more responsive"" version suitable for use by traders.""I've updated NVT Signal to correct for upward drift in the metric (due to volumes moving off the blockchain and only L2),"" he told Twitter followers on Thursday."
474,"Dogecoin (DOGE) hogged the spotlight on a tightly crowded stage throughout most of 2021, as Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider cryptocurrency market climbed to new all-time highs.Fueled by the social media flirtation of an eccentric billionaire, and the coordinated efforts of strategic Reddit traders, Dogecoin’s value increased 15,000% since the turn of the year when it peaked in early May.As Dogecoin’s price boomed so too did its exposure to a mass of internet users who had previously never heard of an eight-year old cryptocurrency that even industry insiders considered to be long dead. Created purely as a joke, Dogecoin was barely a mention in the ongoing story of the cryptocurrency space, which the mainstream media has long considered synonymous with the word “Bitcoin” itself.For that reason, it may have come as a surprise in early May when the volume of Dogecoin searches recorded on Google Trends rose to match that of Bitcoin. Searches for both terms were equal in the first week of May, as Dogecoin rose to an all-time high of $0.73. For context, in January, Bitcoin searches outnumbered Dogecoin by over 8,000%.The Doge’s presence was predictably boosted on Twitter too, where the self-proclaimed Dogefather Elon Musk’s tweets regularly caused Dogecoin mentions to outnumber those of Bitcoin.Data from Bitinfocharts shows the highest spike in Dogecoin Twitter mentions came in late January, when Reddit traders elected Dogecoin to be the cryptocurrency equivalent of GameStop.Doge’s price climbed over 300% on the day in question, and a massive 944,000 tweets containing the word Dogecoin were recorded, compared to just 196,000 that mentioned Bitcoin. Musk lent what many regarded as implied support for the Dogecoin pump at the time, when he posted a meme with the word ‘Dogue’ as a modification of the name of the fashion magazine, Vogue.And so went Dogecoin’s ascension. Amid the furore, new millionaires were created out of thin air, and others lost life savings because they followed what they thought to be the lead of Tesla’s tweet-happy CEO.Related: When will Elon Musk’s influence on Bitcoin end?But what goes up must come down, and as Dogecoin’s valuation fell by over 60%, so too did its cheaply won presence on the media stage. After peaking in early May, Dogecoin searches on Google fell by 90%, as the uninitiated horde of casual internet users moved on to something else.Likewise, after outnumbering Bitcoin mentions on Twitter throughout much of the year, Dogecoin was eventually brought back to heel, and hasn’t outshone Bitcoin on the social media platform in over a month.Taking a peek at blockchain statistics, we also see that some of Dogecoin’s usage stats have dropped even beyond the extent of the recent price crash. We’d typically expect to see Dogecoin transactions at a lower ebb than during this year’s bull run, but as per data from Bitinfocharts, daily Dogecoin transactions recently hit a near three-year low of under 20,000 — a number not witnessed since October 2018.A sign that despite all the media hype, people are actually losing faith in Dogecoin as a usable cryptocurrency? Perhaps. As Dogecoin became the plaything of crypto whales in 2021, it was regularly subject to massive fluctuations in transactions, fees and the value of currency transacted across its blockchain.Related: Only whales move DOGE: Data suggests major Dogecoin wealth gapSince May 5, when over $82 billion was sent across the blockchain in one day, Dogecoin’s daily transaction value has been on the decline, and stood at $4.4 billion as of June 14. Amid the movement of the aforementioned billions, Dogecoin transaction fees rose 25,000%, from $0.01 to $2.52. The subsequent decrease in the blockchain’s usage has since seen fees drop as low as $0.60 once more.While attention and usage appear to be falling across several metrics, it would be folly to bet against Dogecoin mustering a resurgence in the months and years to come. Even if Elon Musk were to lose interest in Dogecoin and his tweets died down, what other global celebrity might come along and expose the coin to a mass audience all over again?Just this week a nonfungible token of the original Dogecoin Shiba Inu picture sold for $4 million in Ether, suggesting hype hasn’t completely cooled on Dogecoin just yet. In May a survey revealed that more Americans had heard of Dogecoin than they had Ethereum — a seven-year-old project which houses the most developers in the cryptocurrency space."
475,"Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs has made another U-turn on its stance toward Bitcoin as it struggles to define the asset’s investment status.The investment bank flip-flopped again in its approach to cryptocurrencies with a report issued earlier this week that claims  they are not a “viable investment”.The report, titled “Digital Assets: Beauty Is Not in the Eye of the Beholder”, concluded Bitcoin is not “a long-term store of value or an investable asset class”.This contradicts their May 21 report titled “Crypto: A New Asset Class?” which was largely positive about the idea and even featured Matthew McDermot, global head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs, saying:That in turn, was a repudiation of another Goldman Sachs presentation last year where different analysts from the bank provided five reasons that Bitcoin was not an asset class suitable for investmen.In the new report, the bank’s Investment Strategy Group stated it wanted to play it safe with regards to cryptocurrency. “We have refrained from repeating the positive and negative hype that surrounds this ecosystem because we do not want clients to be seesawed, even swayed by a cacophony of assertions, many of them unsubstantiated,” the report said.It went on to state that Bitcoin was not “digital gold” — but in any case, gold itself was not a reliable store of value:The report also suggested that blockchains themselves are untrustworthy, concluding that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are “built on layers of trust that could be eroded.”Related: Goldman Sachs readying Bitcoin product for clientsClearly there are divisions in the bank about its approach to cryptocurrency. In May, Goldman Sachs led a $15 million investment round for blockchain analytics firm Coin Metrics.On Monday, June 14, it was reported that McDermott confirmed that the investment bank was expanding its crypto trading desk to include Ethereum options and futures."
476,"An unusual phenomenon called 'backwardation' is taking place in Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading, mainly the June contract, which expires on June 25. The fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium, indicating that sellers request more money to withhold settlement longer. Futures should also trade at a 5% to 15% annualized premium on healthy markets, in line with the stablecoin lending rate. This situation is known as contango and is not exclusive to crypto markets.Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. This situation is known as backwardation and indicates a bearish sentiment.As displayed above, a healthy 0.1% to 0.5% premium took place for most of the previous three weeks. This is equivalent to a 2% to 9% annualized rate, therefore oscillating between slightly bearish and neutral.When short sellers use excessive leverage, the indicator will turn negative, which has been the case on June 17. However, considering there is only one week left for the June expiry, traders should use longer-term contracts to confirm this scenario. As the contract approaches its final trading date, traders are forced to roll over their positions, thus causing exaggerated movements.The September futures have displayed a 1.7% or higher premium versus spot markets, a 7% annualized basis. This indicates a lack of appetite from longs, but far enough from backwardation.Related: Here's how pros safely trade Bitcoin while it range trades near $40KThe final piece of the puzzle is the funding rate on perpetual contracts, which are retail traders' preferred instrument. Unlike monthly contracts, perpetual futures prices (inverse swaps) trade at a very similar price to regular spot exchanges.This condition makes retail traders' lives a lot easier as they no longer need to calculate the futures premium or manually roll over positions nearing expiry.The funding rate is automatically charged every eight hours from longs (buyers) when demanding more leverage. However, when the situation is reversed, and shorts (sellers) are over-leveraged, the funding rate turns negative and they become the ones paying the fee.Since May 24, the funding rate has been oscillating between positive 0.03% and negative 0.05% per 8-hour. Thus, on the most ""bearish"" moments, shorts were paying 1% per week to maintain their positions.In comparison, on April 13, longs were paying 0.12% per 8-hour, which is equivalent to 2.5% per week.While many traders point to backwardation as a bearish signal, there is currently no sign of excessive leverage from shorts. As a result, the absence of buyers' interest for the June contract does not accurately reflect the overall market sentiment. If traders had effectively been bearish, both the longer-term futures and perpetual contracts would be displaying this trend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

477,"Our Man in Shanghai has refused to let recent regulations slow down the news coming from China. Enterprise blockchain, central bank digital currencies and start up projects continue to make a positive impact in a region hoping to grow economic value through technology.The debate around El Salvador continued this week as media and officials tried to digest the adoption of Bitcoin as a national currency. JPMorgan stated that there was little economic benefit, and John Hopkins University professor Steve Hanke warned that the move could “completely collapse the economy” of the small nation. The former Bank of China deputy governor Wang Yongli took a very hardline approach, by stating that volatility and a lack of regulation or controls would put the economy on a “road to death.” This quote, appearing in state run media The Paper June 9, was an unusually direct and colorful statement on the issue.Zhou Xiaoquan, a former governor of the People’s Bank of China, had a few positive things to say about cryptocurrency as a technology on June 11. He spoke at an economic summit in Shanghai and noted the cryptocurrency innovation in China can be productive when it serves the real economy. He also took some shots at other countries, stating that people would be mistaken if they thought other countries were taking the same approach towards building financial services. Zhou, who is one of the most often-quoted economists in the country, felt there was little emphasis on the relationship between financial services and economic value elsewhere in the world. Based on the wild displays at the Miami Bitcoin conference a few weeks ago, his position might be more sound than others would care to admit.China’s e-CNY tests continued with the first reported mass payment of salaries in Xiong’an, a district near the capital Beijing. According to Cointelegraph, the pilot received support from a number of national banks and saw subcontractors paying workers their salaries from a digital wallet.On June 3, a government organization issued a report entitled the China Industrial Blockchain Development Status and Trend Report. According to the report, in 2020, 222 industrial blockchain policies were issued, 12,059 new blockchain-related patent applications were approved, and 776 new blockchain enterprises were established. The report also claimed that the current market size of the industrial blockchain sector was around $22.6 billion U.S. dollars. Industrial blockchain is an area that China is eager to grab control in, leading to this explosive growth in recent years.Leading exchange Huobi surprised futures traders by limiting them to only 5x leverage on perpetual swaps and blocking new users from accessing the feature altogether. Futures trading, particularly highly-leveraged futures trading, had always been popular features on exchanges like OKEx and Huobi. It will be interesting to see whether these new decisions to limit risk will be damaging to these large exchanges that still somewhat adhere to regulator rules. It’s also possible that it’s a short-term solution in order to avoid scrutiny during periods of tighter control.While Huobi was tightening controls on futures traders, Singapore-based platform SynFutures was completing a Series A for $14 million. The round was led by Polychain Capital and included names like Framework Capital, Pantera Capital, Bybit, Kronos Research, WOO Ventures, Wintermute, and IOSG Ventures. SynFutures is creating a trustless derivatives market where users can take positions on assets or anything that has an accurate feed, including Bitcoin, the price of gold, or even the Bitcoin hashrate.

478,"Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped another notch to $37,365 today after a failed attempt by bulls to retake the $40,000 level. The renewed slump comes as the stock market and commodities also pulled back as a result of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments related to future interest rate hikes and concerns over rising inflation which led to pdeclines for both Bitcoin and gold. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of BTC climbed from $38,200 in the early trading hours on Thursday to a high above $39,500 by midday before being pummeled down to a low of $37,365 as bears took control of the market.One signal provided ahead of Bitcoin’s price decline on June 17 was increased inflows to spot exchanges which led some analysts to speculate that traders who failed to cash out near the high are taking advantage of lower highs to lock in gains.#Bitcoin here you can see quite a contrast between the recent inflows into spot exchanges vs derivative exchanges. Very recently a big increase into spot. One theory is that spot holders who didn't sell the top are taking the opportunity to get out on a lower high. pic.twitter.com/6SOI2uXHk8As the sell-off intensified, the netflow of BTC into exchanges saw a noticeable uptick and this selling pressure, along with the lack of dip buyers, kept Bitcoin pinned below $38,000.While the recent BTC inflows to exchanges point to a bearish short-term outlook, it is also worth noting that whale wallets holding between 100 BTC and 10,000 BTC have actually increased their holdings by 90,000 BTC over the past 25 days, suggesting a more positive long term outlook.Related: Bulls aim to reclaim $40K ahead of Friday’s $520M BTC options expiryAnother source to get a better overview of how funds are being deployed across the market is looking at open interest in BTC and Ether (ETH) options.According to Delphi Digital, “open interest for BTC and ETH options have been in decline since mid-May,” but there has been a slight increase in the options open interest for BTC recently. This figure has remained stagnant for Ether, “indicating traders are trying to position themselves for a BTC move instead.”Delphi Digital also said that the recent price action for Bitcoin and gold has revived discussions on the ability of each to operate as a “safe haven asset,” with investors increasingly seeing gold as the main inflation hedge, meaning “rising inflation could negatively impact BTC sentiment.”Given that both assets responded negatively to Powell’s comments, there is a chance that the correlation seen between BTC and gold in 2019 could lead to a revival of the narrative that BTC has evolved into a safe haven asset.The overall altcoin market trended down on June 17 as the lack of optimism weighed heavily on most tokens.Notable exceptions to the market stagnation include a 34% increase for XinFin Network (XDC) following a partnership with Flare Finance and a 32% increase for NuCyper (NU) which has benefited from its recent merger with the Keep project to form the Keanu DAO.As seen in the chart below, the announced merger between NuCyper and Keep was picked up by the NewsQuake™ service from Cointelegraph Markets Pro on June 15 and was followed by an increase in the VORTECS™ Score to a high of 74 on June 16, around 15 hours before the altcoin gained 44%.

479,"The most important aspect in trading is to correctly identify the long-term trend. Once this is done, the rest of the steps are not very difficult because all a trader needs to do is look for buying opportunities in an uptrend and selling opportunities in a downtrend. In reality, many traders complicate the process by waiting for lower levels to buy in a bull market and missing a large portion of the rally. Then, when the trend reverses and the price starts falling, the same traders start buying, which usually results in losses.To avoid this pitfall, traders can incorporate the use of key moving average convergence patterns in order to have a better gauge of market momentum and the direction of the trend. In last week’s article, we reviewed the Death Cross, and this week we will look at the golden cross pattern. This setup can help keep traders at bay in a downtrend and give them a green signal to start buying when the trend turns bullish.Let’s investigate this pattern and learn how to use it when trading.A golden cross is a setup that signals a possible change in a bearish downtrend. It is formed when a faster period moving average, usually the 50-day simple moving average, crosses above the longer-term moving average, generally the 200-day SMA.In a downtrend, both the 50-day SMA and the 200-day SMA are sloping down. However, when the price reaches an attractive valuation, long-term investors start accumulating, which arrests the pace of the decline. As more investors start buying, the trend starts to turn up.A sustained up-move results in the 50-day SMA changing its direction from down to up. However, the 200-day SMA is slower to respond, hence when it is either falling or has flattened out, the 50-day SMA rises above it, forming the golden cross.When a golden cross forms, it is a sign that the downtrend has ended and a new uptrend could have begun.However, like every setup, the golden cross is not foolproof. It gives false signals several times but with a few filters, traders may reduce the whipsaws.Related: Here’s 5 ways investors can use the MACD indicator to make better tradesBitcoin (BTC) bottomed out at $3,858 on March 13, 2020, and the most recent golden cross formed on May 21, 2020, when the price closed at $9,061.96. That means, the BTC/USD pair had already moved 134% from the lows by the time the golden cross confirmed a change in trend.Inexperienced traders may have felt the price has run up too fast and would have waited for a deep correction to happen before buying. However, when a trend changes, it rarely gives an opportunity to buy at much lower levels as was the case here.The rally never looked back and it hit an all-time high at $64,899 on April 14, 2021, a massive 616% gain from the level where the golden cross formed. This shows that the trader who just bought and held after the formation of the golden cross would have earned huge returns.However, every golden cross does not provide such outsized returns and sometimes traders fall victim to whipsaws.Bitcoin dropped from a local high at $13,868.44 on June 26, 2019, to a local low at $6,430 on Dec. 18, 2019. The golden cross formed on Feb. 18, 2020, when the pair closed at $10,188.04.However, traders who bought after the golden cross formed may have suffered quick losses as the pair plummeted to $3,858 just a few days later. This shows how traders may sometimes get caught on the wrong foot by just buying after the golden cross.Related: Unsure about buying the dip? This key trading indicator makes it easierTraders could avoid buying if the golden cross forms when the 200-day SMA is still sloping down. They can wait for the 200-day SMA to flatten out or turn up before buying as that may reduce the whipsaws.As an example, EOS formed a golden cross pattern on Feb. 8, 2020 when the price was at $4.76. This price cleared the filter as the 200-day SMA had flattened out. However, had traders taken the trade, it would have turned into a loss as the EOS/USDT pair topped out at $5.49 on Feb. 17, 2020, and then plunged sharply to $1.35 on March 13, 2020.The second golden cross on Aug. 22, 2020, did not clear the filter as the 200-day SMA was sloping down when the pattern formed. This would have kept the bulls from getting sucked into this trade.The third golden cross on Dec. 12, 2020, cleared the filter but it would have hit the stop-loss as it breached the strong support at $2.20 on Dec. 23, 2020. Finally, the fourth golden cross that formed on Feb. 08, 2021, turned out to be profitable.The above example shows that when the price is stuck in a range, the golden cross does not act as the ideal indicator. Therefore, traders may add another filter to buy only after the price breaks out of the range. This may reduce the whipsaws further and help traders buy only in uptrends.When a cryptocurrency is in a downtrend, traders may wait for the golden cross to occur before starting their purchases. This could keep traders out of trouble in a falling market.After the golden cross sustains and a new uptrend is confirmed, traders may look for buying opportunities. Among the many possibilities, one that was highlighted in an earlier article to buy on dips to the 20-day EMA or the 50-day SMA could come in handy.A golden cross can confirm that a downtrend has ended and a new uptrend could have begun. Until a golden cross forms, long-term investors may avoid cherry-picking as that may result in losses in a downtrend.However, like every other pattern, the golden cross is not perfect. It may result in whipsaws if the coin enters a consolidation during the bottoming formation. Therefore, traders must take precautions to avoid being sucked into bull traps.Once the uptrend is established after the golden cross, traders may look for buying opportunities and stay with the trend till a reversal is signaled.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

480,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls have little reason to celebrate the 25% rally over the past nine days. After testing the $31,000 support on June 8, top traders' optimism faded, and even the recent $41,000 high was unable to boost their expectations.Contrary to market sentiment, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority has indicated a significant increase in cryptocurrency ownership in the country. A consumer survey found that 2.3 million adults in the U.K. now hold crypto assets, which is up from 1.9 million last year.Another theory that has been proven wrong is the supposition that whales have been selling, causing the Bitcoin price to remain below $47,000 for 31 days. Counter to this narrative, data from Santiment shows that addresses holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC increased their positions by $367 billion during that period.Regardless of investors' long-term bullishness, there is $520 million worth of BTC options set to expire at 8:00 am UTC on June 18. While the initial screening shows the neutral-to-bullish call options with a 20% lead, a more granular view provides a different picture.The neutral-to-bullish call (buy) option provides upside price protection to buyers, while the opposite occurs when holding the protective put (sell) options. By measuring each price level's risk exposure, traders can gain insight into how bullish or bearish traders are positioned.The total number of contracts set to expire on June 18 is 13,400, or $520 million at Bitcoin's current $39,000 price. Bulls lead with 1,240 contracts, equivalent to $48 million, but it depends on what price Bitcoin will stand on Friday morning.While the initial picture seems bullish, one must consider that the $44,000 call (buy) options are almost worthless, with less than sixteen hours left before expiry. A more balanced situation emerges when those bullish contracts are disregarded.Less than 2,200 call options have been placed at $38,000 or below, an $84 million open interest. At $40,000, another 1,000 neutral-to-bullish options become active, raising the open interest to $128 million.On the other hand, the protective put options at $38,000 and higher amount to 750 contracts are worth $28 million. This gives bulls a comfortable $60 million lead and an incentive to move the price above $40,000, increasing the difference to $120 million. In this case, 99% of the protective put options will become worthless.Related: Traders look for Bitcoin price daily close at $41K to confirm bullish reversalOptions contracts at Deribit, OKEx, and Bit.com happen exactly at 8:00 am, so there is no benefit in trying to manipulate the price ahead of that event. However, bears may have thrown the towel, concentrating efforts on the monthly expiry on June 25. Bulls, on the other hand, have strong incentives to boost their profits on June 17.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

482,"Bitcoin (BTC) edged closer to $38,000 support on June 17 as comments from the United States Federal Reserve sparked a mass sell-off for gold.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed BTC/USD as it bounced at $38,400 during Thursday, failing to regain $39,000 in what could shape up to be its anticipated ""leg down.""Wednesday's Fed meeting and subsequent comments from Chair Jerome Powell stopped Bitcoin from drifting higher, taking its toll on progress across cryptocurrency.At the time of writing, $38,900 formed a focus as resistance set in but a tight wedge of support remained nearby. Data from Binance showed a large wall of bids lined up at $37,000 and above.More conspicuous losses on the day came from gold, however, which sank to a six-week low after the Fed's inflation message.The dollar saw a major boost, but the combination of predicted higher interest rates combined with future tapering of coronavirus measures formed a perfect storm for the precious metal. At the time of writing, XAU/USD traded below $1,800, having lost almost $100 over the past 24 hours.While traditionally adversaries, Bitcoin and gold remain part of the portfolio recommendations for many major investment names.

483,"For much of its life, Bitcoin (BTC) has been viewed mainly as a speculative financial instrument, but El Salvador’s dramatic move in making BTC a legal tender is a reminder that cryptocurrencies can play a role in uplifting the world’s less-well-off citizens.Two surprising facts emerged on the global stage at the start of June: First, 70% of El Salvador’s population do not have bank accounts, and second, remittances — i.e., money sent home from workers abroad — are fueling El Salvador’s economy, accounting for an astonishing 23% of the gross domestic product.In this regard, Chainalysis was prescient last year when it described the global remittance problem in a blog — perhaps even anticipating a move like El Salvador’s: “Given the importance of remittances in the region, Latin America is one place we would expect to see such activity.”El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, declared that as a result of the new law, “Bitcoin will have 10 million potential new users” in El Salvador, adding that BTC is the “fastest-growing way to transfer $6 billion a year in remittances.”The new law was met with skepticism among some mainstream economists, however, who deemed it unworkable. Johns Hopkins University’s Steve Hanke went so far as to say that it could “completely collapse the [Salvadorian] economy.”But within the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, the move was applauded. Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, commented to Cointelegraph, “The legalization of Bitcoin as a national currency is a uniquely significant event in the history of money, society and globalization,” while Wladimir van der Laan, a Bitcoin core developer and “maintainer,” told Cointelegraph that El Salvador’s action “is absolutely a milestone, also in the sense it is something never tried before. I hope it will be for the best.”Eloisa Cadenas, co-founder of PXO Token — a stablecoin pegged to the Mexican peso — also underlined the new law’s importance. “It marks a different way of looking at Bitcoin and the crypto industry. For much of its history, Bitcoin has struggled against the notion that its principal use is to launder money or ‘commit fraud,’ with relatively little said about its positive qualities,” she told Cointelegraph. But here, “Bitcoin is helping people who really need it.”But making Bitcoin legal tender — which means it can be used to pay taxes, discharge debts and buy goods in stores — carries certain risks. Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Cointelegraph:Prasad wasn’t ruling out all blockchain-related solutions with regard to cross-border payments, acknowledging that “new financial technologies that hold out the promise of reducing costs and frictions of international payments would certainly be a boon for poor countries that rely on remittances from their citizens working abroad,” including “blockchain technology and its variants,” but decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin “are unlikely to become the main vehicles for cheap, quick and efficient cross-border financial transfers.”Legal tender is a somewhat archaic term and often misunderstood, and it can mean different things in different parts of the world. In the United States and the United Kingdom, for instance, retailers are not required by law to accept legal tender — i.e., the dollar and pound sterling, respectively — but El Salvador’s retailers must accept BTC for payment under the new law. As president Bukele explained, as reported by Reuters:Legal tender basically “means that a government has declared a type of money receivable for taxes, and it is legal to use the money in contracts and to denominate goods and services in it,” Franklin Noll, a monetary historian and the president of Noll Historical Consulting, told Cointelegraph.A nation typically brings in a foreign currency as legal tender for three reasons, Noll continued, “The native currency is too volatile in value, there is a shortage of the native currency, or the native currency is not useful in foreign transactions or trade.”But El Salvador has no currency of its own, it is “dollarized” — i.e., it uses the U.S. dollar for all transactions — so currency volatility or foreign trade is not an issue. “This suggests the problem is a shortage of cash” and the country’s lack of banking structure, speculated Noll, further adding:“Probably, El Salvadoreans have been gravitating to Bitcoin for some time as an alternative currency, which ameliorated the cash/electronic cash shortage while providing for lower-cost remittances at the same time. I have to stress that I do not know this for certain.”But Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, and this could introduce some problems. People don’t want to spend BTC when its price is rising, and retailers don’t want to accept Bitcoin when its price is falling. For this reason, economist John Hawkins, writing in The Conversation, surmised that “making Bitcoin legal tender could help destabilise El Salvador’s economy,” adding, “Things would have been simpler if El Salvador had adopted a ‘stablecoin’ whose price is fixed at one US dollar.”It may be difficult to find a workable exchange rate, too, Alistair Milne, crypto skeptic (not to be confused with Alistair Milne, a Bitcoin evangelist based in Atlanta, Georgia) and a financial economics professor at Loughborough University, told Cointelegraph.If the law doesn’t require a particular exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, then, according to Milne, “firms will protect themselves against the risks of accepting BTC by setting a quite adverse exchange rate. [...] So, technically, they accept BTC, but no one would actually pay with BTC.”But if the law specifies a particular exchange rate, for example, “the average exchange rate over a period of, say, 10 minutes before the time of the transaction as obtained from the many standard crypto websites,” then “the costs and risk of exchange then fall on the firms receiving BTC” — though that might appeal to those receiving BTC as a remittance payment from overseas. Milne continued:El Salvador is one of the few nations without its own sovereign currency and so has less to forfeit by making BTC legal tender, no loss of “seigniorage” — i.e., the profit made by a government by issuing currency, for example. So, maybe it won’t have many followers, but Nigel Green, CEO and founder of deVere Group, disagrees. “Where El Salvador has led, we can expect other developing countries to follow. This is because low-income countries have long suffered because their currencies are weak and extremely vulnerable to market changes and that triggers rampant inflation,” he said in a June 9 press release.Will others follow? “Without a doubt,” answered Cadenas, especially those with emerging economies, though they are likely to wait for some first results out of El Salvador. “Nigeria could be the next,” though she would also like to see Mexico, her native country, commit to something similar “due to the amount of remittances entering the country.”If remittances as a share of GDP were the only criteria, Honduras might also be a candidate. Like El Salvador, its remittances exceeded 20% of gross national product in 2019, according to Pew Research, “among the highest shares in the world.” Mexico, by comparison, had only a 3% GDP share, but its gross numbers are high, $42.9 billion in 2020, according to the World Bank, behind only China and India. Most Latin American remittances are sent from the United States.Prasad, however, was dismissive of the notion that other nations might soon follow: “El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin is highly unlikely to set off a wave of the cryptocurrency’s adoption as national legal tender by other countries. The flaws and inefficiencies of decentralized cryptocurrencies are too great for them to become viable substitutes for fiat currencies issued by central banks.”Noll, while doubtful that many other countries would adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, said that “crypto has opened up many options for smaller countries to pursue their own monetary agenda, one that is tailored to their needs.” He offered as examples the Bahamas’ Sand Dollar — the world’s first central bank digital currency — and the Marshall Islands’ blockchain-based currency, SOV. He added:As noted, El Salvador’s president was projecting that Bitcoin could have 10 million new users as a result of the law — based on adding El Salvadorans working abroad to his nation’s 6.5 million population, one presumes.Given that there are an estimated 71 million Bitcoin users worldwide — among 106 million global cryptocurrency users — according to a February 2021 Crypto.com report, that would mean 14% BTC adoption growth from just a single Central American country. What if some other Latin American countries with high remittance shares, including Mexico, were to follow? Would crypto adoption surge?Related: Adopting the Bitcoin standard? El Salvador writes itself into history booksChainlink’s Nazarov thinks just that, telling Cointelegraph, “Just like emerging markets leapfrogged past landlines straight to mobile phones, I believe that these markets’ new-found internet connectivity, combined with the internet native capabilities of Bitcoin, DeFi and smart contracts, makes them the perfect place for large-scale global adoption.” “This is just the beginning of Bitcoin, DeFi and smart contract adoption in emerging markets, and as the benefits of this historic decision are shown to be true, even more countries will follow El Salvador’s example,” he concluded.Cadenas told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is now evolving as a “common asset that is being used by all socioeconomic levels,” not just the wealthy, adding:"
484,"Ric Edelman, founder of financial advisory outfit Edelman Financial Engines, described Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto assets as a “completely new and different asset class” that has nothing in common with mainstream staples like stocks, bonds, real estate, oil, or commodities, to mention a few.Speaking to Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, the financial adviser called Bitcoin and crypto “the first genuinely new asset class in about 150 years.” According to Edelman, not since the gold market has there been an innovative asset class like cryptocurrencies.As part of the discussion, Edelman revealed that he was helping educate financial advisers about the need to be more open-minded about crypto as a viable portfolio diversifier.Indeed, as previously reported by Cointelegraph, a recent survey by corporate research outfit Opinium showed that over 90% of 200 polled independent financial advisers in the United Kingdom were against crypto investments for their clients.While not specifically reacting to the Opinium poll, Edelman characterized the reticence among independent financial advisers (IFAs) as being due to bias, stating:According to Edelman, given that portfolio diversification and rebalancing are popular strategies of IFAs, then BTC should be an obvious choice.Related: Crypto and ‘meme stocks’ shunned by 90% of UK financial advisersEdelman further argued that financial advisers need only look to the technological underpinnings of cryptocurrencies to see that cryptos are not in the same cadre as tulips or beanie babies.For Edelman, crypto and blockchain technology, in general, is the “most impactful commercial innovation since the development of the internet itself.”Back in 2019, the financial adviser remarked that a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the United States was an inevitability."
485,"In terms of price potential, Bitcoin (BTC) is staring at the possibility of outperforming Ether (ETH) in the short term.So believes David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at ExoAlpha — a Paris-based investment management service — who noted that Bitcoin’s upside potential in the near term is higher than that of Ether’s. He said so after spotting a recent shift in the BTC/ETH ratio.In detail, BTC/ETH compares the trend momentum of Bitcoin and Ether. A lower reading suggests that Bitcoin’s price is rising slower than Ether’s. Conversely, a higher BTC/ETH ratio indicates that the Bitcoin price momentum is gaining an edge over Ether.Of late, Ether appeared like a heightened version of Bitcoin. When the BTC/USD exchange rate spiked, the ETH/USD exchange rate rallied but with higher margins. Similarly, when BTC/USD went down, ETH/USD plunged more.The difference in price momentum sent the BTC/ETH ratio declining inside a descending channel range. In doing so, the ratio offered traders a way to gauge which token — Bitcoin or Ether — would return better profits in terms of short-term relative strength momentum. Lifchitz weighed:The comparison between Bitcoin and Ether price momentums came as the United State Federal Reserve officials announced Wednesday that they expect to start raising interest rates in 2023, earlier than the previous forecast of 2024.Bitcoin and Ether’s first reaction to the Fed news was negative. The BTC/USD exchange rate closed the day 4.51% lower, while ETH/USD went down by 6.91%. In comparison, on May 19, after Elon Musk had launched a tweet war against Bitcoin, BTC/USD fell 14.29% and ETH/USD by 27.61%.The readings pointed that the dramatic difference between Bitcoin and ETH price momentums started flattening after the May 19 crash. Lifchitz called it as yet another sign that Bitcoin would become more valuable than Ether. He said: Meanwhile, Lifchitz reminded that the BTC/USD ratio’s relief bounce would do little in offsetting the descending channel pressure. Therefore, the ratio may continue to head lower after it tests the channel’s upper range.The scale of Bitcoin and Ether’s next trends — whether upside or downside — depends on their idiosyncratic technical and fundamental factors.Lifchitz said Bitcoin, which remains range-stuck between $33,000 and the $39,000–$40,000 area, would need to break above $42,000 to confirm a short-term bullish bias. In doing so, the benchmark cryptocurrency could rise to $50,000, a level coinciding with the local bottoms of April 26 and May 12.But for a bullish move to happen, the executive added that Bitcoin miners would need to exhaust their selling or be convinced that they would later sell their BTC reserves at higher prices. Meanwhile, dip buyers and institutional investors, such as MicroStrategy, would provide further upside tailwinds to the $50,000 price target.“And of course, in the middle of this battle between bulls and bears, there’s Elon Musk tweet-factory, being one time supportive of Bitcoin, one time not, which shakes the price each time,” Lifchitz reminded.As for Ether, Lifchitz expected the cryptocurrency to surge to $2,850 in the coming sessions. It is the same level that ETH hit before popping up higher on May 3; meanwhile, it also served as resistance as ETH attempted to recover fully from its May 19 price bottom.Ether bulls continued to grapple with a symmetrical triangle indicator on the flip side and its tendency to send prices further lower. Symmetrical triangles are continuation patterns. Therefore, they tend to send the prices in the direction of their previous trends.“As the price approaches the apex of that triangle, some resolution is expected either up or down from the $2,500 level,” said Lifchitz.Meanwhile, one big takeaway from both Bitcoin and Ether charts concerned their volumes. While BTC/USD reported higher trading volumes after the May 19 price crash, Ether’s were more or less the same.“This comforts the potential reverse of power between Bitcoin and Ether,” Lifchitz stressed."
486,"The United States’ National Republican Congressional Committee — the body responsible for coordinating Republican electoral efforts — is introducing donations in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).The NRCC announced Wednesday on Twitter that the committee will begin accepting crypto donations for election campaigns, sending its fundraising efforts “to the moon.”https://t.co/aIisNV5BiD pic.twitter.com/F9ktKFfHAqAccording to a Wednesday report by Axios news agency, the NRCC will process crypto donations using major payment platform BitPay, through which donations will be immediately converted to U.S. dollars.The cash conversion means that the NRCC will be able to accept individual donations of up to $10,000 per year — multitudes more than the $100 maximum-value limit for transfers of actual cryptocurrencies. The NRCC said that it will collect all identifying data from individuals who donate with crypto.NRCC chairman and Minnesota Representative Tom Emmer said that accepting crypto is part of Republicans’ efforts to pursue “every avenue possible” for winning elections. “This innovative technology will help provide Republicans the resources we need to succeed,” he said.Related: XRP Is Not a Security, Argues US Congressman Tom EmmerEmmer has emerged as a prominent proponent for cryptocurrencies in Congress.

487,"Bitcoin (BTC) stayed below $40,000 on June 17 as a surging U.S. dollar added to downward BTC price pressure.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD trading at around $39,300 on Thursday.The largest cryptocurrency fell during a meeting of the Federal Reserve the day before in which Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged inflation could run higher than planned in the short term. As Cointelegraph reported, May's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation hitting a 13-year high last month.While traditionally a boon for Bitcoin, however, Powell's confidence in inflation returning to normal long term ultimately  served to boost the dollar more than BTC.""Yes, they are anchored and they're at a good place right now — it's gratifying to see them having moved off of their pandemic lows,"" Powell said in subsequent media comments about inflation indicators.That goal is currently around 2%, with the Fed acknowledging that there would be periods where rates overshoot that threshold. The dollar gained on the back of the meeting, with the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) advancing to two-month highs.This is a classic provider of friction for Bitcoin, and already tepid sentiment over the outlook for the bull run of 2021 continuing saw a further test.Popular trader Crypto Ed nonetheless noted the positive implications of BTC/USD bouncing off $38,000 support at its intraday lows.Related: Pantera CEO: Crypto market 'panic' is subsiding, now's the time to buy""Let's not forget the possible extension to fill the CME gap,"" he added as part of comments on the low, with the futures gap — another favorite short-term price influencer — at $37,000.At the same time, fellow trader Peter Brandt highlighted a number of gaps which remain unfilled on BTC/USD, while adding that he doesn’t believe all gaps must get filled.Previously, Cointelegraph reported on the changing face of Bitcoin investor habits during this prolonged period of lower prices.Hodlers are storing coins for longer, and even those who bought during the first months of the bull market remain committed to not selling, data shows."
488,"A new study by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority has indicated a significant increase in cryptocurrency ownership in the country.On Thursday, the FCA published the results of a consumer survey which found that 2.3 million adults in the U.K. now hold crypto assets, up from 1.9 million last year. Alongside the increasing number of crypto investors, the study also identified a surge in ownership volumes, with median holdings rising to 300 British pounds ($420) from 260 pounds ($370) in 2020.The rising popularity of holding cryptocurrency comes in line with an uptick in the awareness level as 78% of adults said they have heard of crypto, up from 73% last year.Despite the rising awareness and ownership of crypto, the FCA study has flagged a notable decline in understanding of cryptocurrencies, suggesting that some people who have heard of crypto may not fully understand it.According to the report, only 71% of respondents correctly identified the definition of cryptocurrency from a list of statements, down 4% from 2020. “This suggests there may be a risk of consumers engaging with cryptocurrency without a clear understanding of it,” the FCA noted.Related: Crypto and ‘meme stocks’ shunned by 90% of UK financial advisersSheldon Mills, the FCA’s executive director of consumers and competition, said that some U.K. investors have benefitted from the bull market this year. “However it is important for customers to understand that because these products are largely unregulated that if something goes wrong they are unlikely to have access to the FSCS or the Financial Ombudsman Service,” he added.The FCA study also said that U.K. consumers significantly favor Bitcoin (BTC) over other cryptocurrencies, with 82% of respondents recognizing BTC. Among those who recognized at least one cryptocurrency, 70% recognized only Bitcoin, up 15% from 2020, the study said. “It seems likely many adults who have now heard of cryptocurrency are only acquainted with Bitcoin,” the FCA stated."

491,"The chief executive of Pantera Capital, Dan Morehead, is confident that the big crypto selloff is slowing because he thinks “we’ve seen the most of this panic”.In the monthly newsletter published on June 14, the venture capitalist stated that the best time to buy is when markets are “well below trend”. A Bitcoin trend deviation chart backed up this claim as it showed that the asset has only been this “cheap” relative to its trend for a fifth of its lifecycle.For new investors, it’s best to buy when the market is well below trend.

492,"Bitcoin dropped closer to a key support level and the Dow and the S&P 500 pulled back after the Federal Reserve moved forward its plan for 2 interest rate hikes in 2023.Bitcoin (BTC) price extended its losses shortly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the Fed would move forward its timeline and schedule two interest rate hikes in 2023.Bitcoin price was already seeing weakness in the early trading hours after losing the $40,000 level to mark an intra-day low at $38,300. The Dow and S&P 500 also pulled back 0.77% and 0.54% respectively.The decision comes as economists worry about rising inflation in the United States and Powell said that the Fed had raised its inflation expectation from 2.4% to 3.4%. While Powell described the current inflation spike as “transitory”, consumer prices are at a 13 year high and analysts worry that rising inflation will impact the post-covid economic recovery.Powell did not directly address whether, or when the Fed would begin tapering its $120 billion monthly bond purchases but the decision to begin raising rates in 2023 suggests that the program will see cuts way in advance of 2023 in order to be carried out in a moderate fashion.On June 15 Bitcoin price successfully completed its bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern (4-hour chart), but fell short of the $45,500 target after hitting resistance at $41,350.While the price has slipped below $40,000 and failed to flip the level to support, analysts are viewing the current price action as nothing more than range-bound trading and at the time of writing, $38,300 looks like a lower support retest.With less than 3 hours before the daily close, traders will likely look for BTC to hold above the 20-day moving average near the $37,000 level which is expected to function as support.One thing to note is the steady inflow of BTC to major exchanges and an increase in miner outflows over the past few days as data from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin inflows lead to bearish outcomes.The 50- and 200-day moving averages are also en route to converge, possibly forming a bearish ‘death cross’, but both are lagging indicators, meaning they are not entirely reflective of spot price action. Nevertheless, both moving averages could present considerable resistance for bulls.A dip below the $37,000 to $36,000 range where many traders on crypto-Twitter have announced they have bids would likely take BTC price to the lower end of its current range in the $35,000 to $31,000 zone.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision."
493,"Bitcoin’s price (BTC) turned down from just above the $41,000 mark on June 15, suggesting that traders are halting their purchases at higher levels. Traders seem to be hesitant to take large bets until the U.S. Federal Reserve releases its latest economic projections and the timeline of the proposed rate hikes today.However, Jurrien Timmer, the director of global macro at Fidelity Investments believes that Bitcoin has bottomed out.Another positive sign comes from a Q2 retail investment survey of high-frequency traders by the crypto firm Voyager Digital that shows 81% of the participants are confident about the future of cryptocurrency.Another survey of 100 chief financial officers at hedge funds by Intertrust Global shows that about 98% of the respondents expect hedge funds to invest 7.2% of their assets in cryptocurrencies by 2026.Related: Within five years, US hedge funds expect to hold 10.6% of assets in cryptoGiven that there are large amounts of funds ready to flow into cryptocurrencies, another massive fall is unlikely. However, that does not mean a new bull market will start in a hurry. Most major cryptocurrencies may enter a bottoming formation before starting the next trending move.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the critical levels to watch out for.Bitcoin has been sustaining above the 20-day exponential moving average ($38,274) for the past three days but the bulls have not been able to thrust the price above the 200-day simple moving average ($42,678). This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.The flattish 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If bears pull the price below the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $31,000 where buying may emerge.A strong rebound off $31,000 will indicate that the pair may extend its consolidation for a few more days.This neutral view will invalidate if the price rebounds off the current level and buyers drive the price above the 200-day SMA. Such a move will be the first sign that the correction may be over. If bulls sustain the price above the 200-day SMA for three days, the pair could rally to $51,483.Alternatively, a break below $31,000 will suggest that bears have overpowered the bulls and the downtrend may resume.Ether (ETH) has been trading inside a symmetrical triangle for the past few days, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. The bulls are buying near the support line of the triangle while the bears are selling near the resistance line.A break above or below the triangle may result in a strong trending move but it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty.If bulls push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the triangle, it will indicate that the correction may be over. The ETH/USDT pair could then rally toward its pattern target at $3,684.Conversely, if bears sink the price below the support line, the downtrend may resume. The bulls will try to stall the decline at the 200-day SMA ($1,831) but if this support also cracks, the next target objective is $1,347.Binance Coin (BNB) has been stuck between the trendline and the 20-day EMA ($372) for the past few days. The gradually downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 44 suggest that bears have the upper hand.If bears sink the price below the trendline, the BNB/USDT pair could drop to the 200-day SMA ($253). A break and close below this support could intensify the selling, and the pair could extend the decline to $200.On the contrary, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could challenge the overhead resistance at $433. A breakout and close above this level will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective at $609.Cardano (ADA) has been trading between $1.33 and $94 for the past few days. The altcoin rebounded off the support on June 12 but the bulls are struggling to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.58).The gradually downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears. If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will again try to sink the ADA/USDT pair below $1.33.If they succeed, the pair could drop to the next critical support at $1. The bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively. A strong rebound off this support will suggest that the pair may consolidate inside the large range of $1 and $1.94 for a few days.Conversely, if buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to $1.94. A breakout of this resistance will increase the possibility of the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Dogecoin (DOGE) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($0.34) for the past few days but the bears have not been able to sink the price below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. This suggests a lack of sellers at lower levels.However, the 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating the path of least resistance is to the downside. The bears will make one more attempt to sink and sustain the price below the neckline.If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could start its downward journey to the critical support at $0.21 and then to the 200-day SMA ($0.14). This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA.XRP has been trading between $1.07 and $0.75 for the past few days. The failure of the bulls to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.93) in the past few days suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.The bears will now try to pull the price down to the support at $0.75. The 200-day SMA ($0.72) is just below the support, hence the bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively.However, if the selling intensifies and bears sink the price below the 200-day SMA, the XRP/USDT pair could start a deeper decline to $0.56.On the other hand, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to $1.07. A breakout and close above this resistance will indicate the downtrend may be over. The pair could then rally to the downtrend line.Polkadot (DOT) rose to the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on June 14 but the bulls could not thrust the price above it. This suggests that the bears have not given up yet and are selling on rallies to the resistance line.If bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($23), the DOT/USDT pair could extend its stay inside the symmetrical triangle for a few more days. The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint also signals a few days of consolidation.A breakout and close above the triangle will be the first indication that the correction may be over. The pair may then rally to $31.28 and then to the pattern target at $39.78. Conversely, if bears sink the price below the support line, the pair may start the next leg of the downtrend that may open the doors for a decline to $15.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($24.79) on June 15, which suggests the sentiment remains negative and the bears are selling on rallies to overhead resistances.The sellers will now try to pull the price below the 200-day SMA ($21.87). If they manage to do that, the UNI/USDT pair could drop to $16.49 and then $13.04 as traders who have purchased in the past few days may rush to the exit.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the 200-day SMA, the buyers will try to propel the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair may rally to $30.If the price turns down from this level, the pair may remain range-bound between $21.50 and $30 for a few more days. A breakout and close above $30 will suggest that the correction may be over.Litecoin (LTC) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($180) on June 15, which shows that bears are selling on rallies. The 20-day EMA continues to slope down and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating an advantage to the bears.The sellers will now try to sink the price below the support line. If they do that, the LTC/USDT pair could retest the May 23 low at $118.03. A break below this level could result in panic selling that may drag the price down to $70.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the support line, the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the moving averages. If they succeed, the pair could rise to $225. A break above this resistance could attract buyers.The bulls could not propel Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the downtrend line for the past two days, indicating that bears are defending the 20-day EMA ($662) aggressively.The bears will now try to sustain the price below the 200-day SMA ($603) and challenge the $538.11 support. This is an important level to watch out for because if it cracks, the descending triangle will complete and the BCH/USDT pair could resume its down move.The next support on the downside is at $400 and then $370. Conversely, if bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to $864.28 where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

494,"The cryptocurrency market is in the midst of another lackluster day on June 16, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dipping below $40,000 ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where United States officials intend to discuss whether interest rates should be raised or kept near zero.While many investors anticipate that BTC will soon resume its bull run and rally above $40,000, technical analysts are sounding the alarm about a looming death cross that could send Bitcoin's price to $30,000 and below.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that after losing the $40,000 support level, Bitcoin bulls were overrun by sellers, triggering a drop to June 16's intraday low at $38,415. Despite the threat of a death cross and significant headwinds residing in the $40,000—$42,000 resistance cluster, recent data from Glassnode suggests that the newest crop of Bitcoin hodlers show no signs of selling at the current levels, especially for wallets that have been holding for longer than three months.According to David Lifchitz, managing partner and chief investment officer of ExoAlpha, Bitcoin price action has been stuck in a range between $33,000 and $40,000 for more than three weeks as the market attempts to stabilize following the May 19 sell-off.The market crash managed to “wash out speculators who were the ones who tended to move the price in a ‘fast and furious’ way,” leading to a decline in momentum for BTC, which is now “stuck in limbo.” He added that there is “a fierce battle brewing under the surface between bulls and bears,” which has resulted in a “higher average traded volume post-crash.”Lifchitz indicated that the bulls are comprised of “dip buyers and institutional investors such as Micro Strategy which take advantage of the dip to reinforce their holdings,” while the bears are “probably miners who are looking to unload at the best price they can get now (i.e. circa $40k) in order not to crash the market more and thus shot themselves in the foot.""From a technical perspective, Lifchitz highlighted the $42,000 level as a significant hurdle for the price of Bitcoin, which would likely need miners to “exhaust their selling or be convinced that they could unload at a higher price if they let Bitcoin breathe a little bit” in order to overcome.""Lifchitz said:Altcoins also faced pressure as Bitcoin' price fell below $40,000, but there were a few tokens that managed to buck the bearish trend. The best performing token on June 16 is Amp, which gained 44% to establish a new record high at $0.1211. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Chiliz (CHZ) also rallied another 18% following June 15's 20% gain after the news that Coinbase Pro would list both assets.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.6 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 45.3%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

495,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has retreated by more than 40% after topping out near $65,000 in mid-April. But that is not enough to derail the flagship cryptocurrency's long-term bull trend, especially as global markets grapple with declining national currencies and the prospect of a commodity market crash.So believes Mike McGlone, the senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, who said Wednesday that diversifying into store-of-value assets is a wise strategy against gloomy currency and commodity market outlooks.""There's little risk of the dollar dropping in value vs. similarly depreciating currencies, which means that diversification into store-of-value assets like gold and Bitcoin is simply a prudent move, in our view,"" he tweeted Wednesday.McGlone's bullish analogy took references from a recent spike in money injected into the U.S. and Eurozone economies. The U.S. Money Supply M2, a measure of the money supply that includes cash and checking deposits (M1) and near money, reached $20.256 trillion on May 3, 2021, from $15.384 trillion on Feb. 10, 2020.A surplus liquidity injection into the U.S. economy left the dollar weaker against top foreign currencies. As a result, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell by almost 11.22% from its mid-March 2020 high of 101.947 to 90.5 as of June 16.Meanwhile, the Eurozone Money Supply M2, the money supply in the European Union area, surged from €5.6 trillion in February 2020 to over €14 trillion in March 2021However, Euro rallied against the U.S. dollar despite its oversupplied status, with Jordan Rochester, a Group-of-10 foreign exchange analyst at Nomura International, noting that the European government's attuned response to the coronavirus pandemic drifted capital out of the U.S. markets to enter the eurozone economy.On the other hand, Bitcoin logged supersonic price rallies against the dollar and euro on promises to shield investors from higher inflation. While the BTC/USD exchange rate jumped from $3,858 in March 2020 to a little over $40,000 in June 2021, the BTC/EUR exchange rate spiked from €3,363 to around €32,000 within the same period.Recent consumer price index reports in the U.S. showed that the inflation rate reached 5% in May 2021, the highest since 1992. In Europe, the headline rate for price growth reached 2%, topping the European Central Bank's (ECB) target.Meanwhile, ECB chief Christina Legarde said that they would continue purchasing bonds, fearing tapering of any kind would derail the eurozone recovery.Related: Looming ‘death cross’ may put Bitcoin bull run in danger ahead of Fed meetingFederal Reserve officials also expect to sideline inflationary pressure as they conclude their two-day Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting on Wednesday. Earlier, the U.S. central bank said that higher CPI in April and May are ""transitory in nature.""Many are worried the fed's current policies are setting us up for (and we are already seeing) high inflation. Inflation is bullish asset prices, b/c the dollar is worth less. Even if the asset is worth the same, the dollar it's being marked against is worth less.

Copper, the bellwether for macroeconomic health, surged 67% as investors looked for havens against falling currencies. Aluminum, zinc, among other metals also reported massive uptrends.But China recently has come up with a plan to tame the booming commodity prices. The National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration said Wednesday that it would increase the supply of metals, including copper, aluminum, and zinc, to make them available to manufacturers.Wow, more big moves from China to tamp down the commodity boom. Big change from earlier this year. https://t.co/7EKPZJU1AJ pic.twitter.com/5Z3RCArxLHMcGlone hinted that a prospect of declining commodity prices would also mean great investment opportunities in the gold and Bitcoin markets."
496,"Environmental concerns regarding the energy-intensive, proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism that Bitcoin (BTC) uses to produce new coins and verify transactions have been front and center lately. Debates regarding Bitcoin’s energy use particularly surged following a tweet sent out by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in May saying that his company would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to the network’s “increasingly rapid use of fossil fuels.”Since then, a number of ways Bitcoin mining companies could go green have been discussed, many of which include using 100% renewable energy sources. For example, El Salvador president Nayib Bukele recently disclosed plans for a geothermal power company, letting Bitcoin miners use its facilities to ensure clean mining.While innovative, these initiatives may be easier said than done. Moreover, if these mechanisms were to be achieved, proof of Bitcoin’s green potential may still be required to show its impact.In order to demonstrate true energy conservation, Bryan Bullett, CEO of Bit Digital — one of the largest publicly listed Bitcoin mining companies — told Cointelegraph that the company recently submitted for a third-party environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) review. Bullett noted that the international ESG framework is used by many companies and favored by institutional investors to track and verify companies’ environmental standards and adherence.Sam Tabar, chief strategy officer of Bit Digital, further told Cointelegraph that the firm may be the only Nasdaq-listed miner that has engaged an independent ESG firm:According to Tabar, once completed, the ESG report from Apex will allow Bit Digital to draw meaningful conclusions to better understand the firm’s ESG performance against international standards and its peers, and then identify areas for improvement, all while tracking progress over time.It’s important to point out that Bit Digital’s ESG rating is not yet available, as Tabar added that he is not sure when the firm will receive the score. “It’s not up to us, but we are willing to be reviewed. Our miner fleet has been running on a majority of carbon-free energy mix on average, so we expect that will be reflected in our score.”Although Bit Digital may be one of the first mining companies to undergo an ESG review from a third-party firm, other miners may also choose to do the same.For example, Rob Chang, CEO of Gryphon Digital Mining — a clean energy Bitcoin mining company — told Cointelegraph that the company is using 100% hydroelectricity to mine Bitcoin. While Chang noted that Gryphon has already achieved 100% carbon neutrality, Brittany Kaiser, chair of the board of directors at Gryphon, explained that an ESG rating will be performed upon the launch of the company’s first mining machines, which is set for the beginning of August. “We have not seen ESG rated yet, as we are pre-operational. However, our electricity source is 100% renewable and we have purchased more than 250x more carbon credits to offset the delivery of our mining machines than the footprint it will create.”Tabar additionally pointed out that it’s important for publicly listed mining companies to undergo ESG ratings for their shareholder’s knowledge: While the case for ESG ratings is clear, it may be challenging for Bitcoin miners to obtain an ESG score, as a lot of data must be disclosed. Andy Pitts-Tucker, ESG managing director for Apex Group, told Cointelegraph that the ESG rating process varies based on the provider in question. “For listed businesses or funds, companies are evaluated based on publicly available information such as media sources and annual reports, with scores given for each ‘E,’ ‘S’ and ‘G’ category, alongside an overall score.” He added, “For private companies and their investors, data must be provided by the companies themselves.”Pitts-Tucker further added that an ESG rating specifically provides a consistent standard against which a company’s ESG performance can be measured. As such, he noted that ESG ratings really gained attention last year, as the global pandemic renewed the world’s focus on risks of all types, including non-financial and ESG factors:Although a recent decarbonization report from Big Four firm KPMG reinstates that ESG ratings are quickly becoming a best practice for companies, some traditional financial service firms consider a Bitcoin ESG to be near impossible.For example, Benefit Financial Services Group, a registered investment advisor for both institutions and individuals, recently published a blog post on the challenges of obtaining a Bitcoin ESG score. Unsurprisingly, the post mentions that by nature, Bitcoin mining is an “undeniable environmental offender.” As such, the entire document slams Bitcoin for being unethical and harmful toward the environment.Related: Fortunes turning? Specialized GPUs and SSDs come to aid crypto minersWhile this may be a common opinion, Sam Wyner, cryptoasset services director and co-lead at KPMG, told Cointelegraph that in some cases, Bitcoin mining operations may be better positioned than larger organizations for an ESG score since they are typically smaller, more focused and, therefore, more agile:"
497,"There’s never a dull day when it comes to crypto as was exemplified recently when the digital asset market dipped by around 50%, eventually taking the total capitalization from its all-time high of $2.5 trillion to around $1.7 trillion. As was expected, in the wake of all this turbulence, Michael Saylor-led business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced that it was all set to “buy the dip” — successfully concluding its $500-million offering of secured notes.To further elaborate on the matter, per a statement released by the company, it was revealed that MicroStrategy had been able to facilitate a sale of $500 million worth of “senior secured notes” via a private offering to a set number of buyers based out of the United States. Of the above-stated total, after expense deductions, initial purchaser discounts and commissions are taken into consideration, the net total will work out to $488 million, the entirety of which will be used for additional Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition by the firm.To quickly recap MicroStrategy’s recent crypto purchasing efforts, it should be highlighted that since August of last year — a time when the firm bought $250 million worth of BTC — the company has been on a Bitcoin-buying frenzy, as is highlighted by the fact that the firm holds a total of 92,079 BTC, which works out to nearly $3.8 billion.Lastly, it bears mentioning that if BTC’s value continues to hover around the $40,000 zone, MicroStrategy will most likely be able to add around 11,900 Bitcoin to its balance sheets, bringing the company’s total crypto haul to over $4.2 billion.On June 7, MicroStrategy announced the launch of the aforementioned private offering, initially stating that it was looking to raise around “$400 million aggregate principal amount”; however, as highlighted previously, this number now stands close to $500 million. What’s more, following the announcement, Michael Saylor claimed that his company had already received $1.6 billion worth of orders for their latest offering — i.e., four times the initial amount.Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer of Komodo — a blockchain solutions provider — told Cointelegraph that MicroStrategy’s move isn’t that surprising, especially when considering that its newly formed subsidiary, MacroStrategy LLC., already owns a lot of BTC, adding:In this regard, it bears mentioning that the development has clearly had a positive impact on the Bitcoin market. In confluence with other positive news, the price of BTC has jumped from just over $35,000 to over $40,000 since the announcement. “The market does appear bearish overall despite this news, but one or two more stories of major institutional adoption of Bitcoin or other cryptos could very well bring the bull market back,” Stadelmann concluded.Similarly, Konstantin Anissimov, executive director for cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO, told Cointelegraph that the consistency with which MicroStrategy has continued to amass Bitcoin has been contagious, to say the least. In his view, the $500-million bond strategy is a means of emphasizing the company’s highly futuristic outlook:MicroStrategy’s continued crypto accrual raises a pertinent question: Is Bitcoin undervalued right now? Daniel Peled, co-founder of Ethereum-based interoperable blockchain platform Orbs, told Cointelegraph that he is mightily impressed with Saylor’s conviction regarding Bitcoin as well as his general treasury management decisions, especially during these times of unprecedented quantitative easing, adding:Peled further opined that MicroStrategy has added to this excellent timing by setting up its bond offering, ensuring that only the BTC purchased with the proceeds from the offering are senior secured and that the annual interest rate is significantly below the company’s annual profit levels, giving it the ability to cover its payments at least for the foreseeable future.The above-highlighted structure effectively limits the ability of the company’s core business and assets to be negatively affected, particularly if its bet on buying additional BTC doesn’t pay off. “It sets up MicroStrategy to enjoy the benefits when the BTC market corrects to reflect the fundamentals,” Peled believes.When MicroStrategy kicked off its plan to start buying crypto via its first corporate bond issuance scheme, Bitcoin’s value was hovering at around the $17,000 threshold only to explode by nearly four times over the course of the next few months. Thus, it stands to reason that the firm probably sees big things for BTC in the near to mid-term, especially after this period of ongoing turbulence subsides.Also, as pointed out earlier, owing to the fact that MicroStrategy’s latest offering was reportedly oversubscribed upon its launch, there still seems to be a large appetite for Bitcoin across the global investor landscape. Not only that, even the United States Security and Exchange Commission’s decision regarding VanEck’s Bitcoin ETF application is currently pending, which, if approved, may serve as another catalyst for continued BTC adoption.Steven Gregory, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Currency.com’s U.S. subsidiary, told Cointelegraph, “The one almost ironic event to come out of this bond issuance is the Fed unknowingly having exposure to this round through their junk-buying program.”Related: GME and AMC stock surge may impact crypto meme coins, BTC not so much?Jack Tao, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Phemex, believes that this move is consistent with the overall trend of institutional money flowing into crypto. However, what’s striking to him is the fact that all of these developments are taking place despite the persisting bearish conditions, as he told Cointelegraph: “Many in the world of traditional finance are starting to realize crypto’s potential to ignite an unprecedented paradigm shift. They’re beginning to invest into the technology rather than just chasing speculative profits.”MicroStrategy’s decision to borrow from the corporate junk bond market to finance its BTC acquisition seems to clearly reflect heavily on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s current inflationary “quantitative easing” policy that was designed to help soften the blow inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic on the American economy.In fact, the numbers say it all, as is best highlighted by the fact that corporate borrowing has never been easier. For example, MicroStrategy’s latest offering promises a 6.25%–6.5% yield compared to the average junk bond yield of 4.01%.Therefore, it will be interesting to see whether others follow in Saylor’s footsteps and continue to accumulate Bitcoin, especially after it was recently announced that El Salvador was going to start accepting the flagship crypto as legal tender."
498,"Bitcoin (BTC) wobbled around $40,000 as investors waited for the United States Federal Reserve to release its new set of economic projections on Wednesday.The market's focus shifted to two important questions: Will United States central bank officials signal their intentions to raise interest rates in 2023 instead of 2024? And how much do they think inflation will rise in the remainder of 2021 and in the next year?In March, the last Fed projection saw 11 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) officials agreeing to keep interest rates near zero at least until 2023. That suggested a tightening in the Fed's monetary policy in 2024. It would also imply that the Fed might trim its $120 billion asset purchasing program earlier than anticipated.The prospects of ""taper tantrums"" in the medium term have also increased due to the latest consumer price index (CPI) readings, the Fed's preferred gauge to measure inflation. The April CPI data showed that inflation rose to 4.2%. Meanwhile, in May, it rose to 5% for the first time since 1992.Nevertheless, the Fed defended the dramatic inflationary spikes by saying that they are ""transitory"" in nature. The central bank has committed to waiting until it sees inflation rates holding themselves up near higher levels before announcing rate cuts. The projections on Wednesday will indicate how long officials will wait for the next tapering. David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital — a New York-based multistrategy crypto-asset fund, believes the Fed's sentiment toward keeping its expansionary policies intact would change following Wednesday's FOMC meeting.""As always, the Fed's post-meeting statement is going to [be] parsed carefully by analysts,"" he told Cointelegraph.The rate hike projections give Bitcoin at least two years to continue its anti-inflation bull run.The benchmark cryptocurrency emerged as a star performer after the March 2020 global market crash, led by fears that the Fed's quantitative easing policies, coupled with the U.S. government's trillions of dollars worth of stimulus aid, would sap investors' appetite for government bonds and the U.S. dollar.The BTC/USD exchange rate jumped from its mid-March 2020 low of $3,858 to as high as $64,898 in April 2021, up 1,582%. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note surged from 0.36% in March 2020 to 1.774% in March 2021. Yields move inversely to bond prices.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, crashed 9.48% in the same period. The bond market and the U.S. dollar have recovered lately on strong economic projections in the U.S. post reopening.Meanwhile, Bitcoin has dipped by more than 25%, partly because of Elon Musk's anti-Bitcoin tweets and because of regulatory fear, uncertainty and doubt, or ""FUD.""Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC, noted that rising inflation coupled with Fed's efforts to keep interest rates near the current 0.25% gives Bitcoin ample opportunities to resume its bull run.This is also because other traditional safe-havens, such as government bonds, offer historically lower yields. At the same time, Bitcoin promises a higher rate of growth.Spanos said:Tawil also presented a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, noting that investors would keep looking at the cryptocurrency as their ""flight to safety"" against higher inflation.""If the legislative critics and the celebrity personalities can keep their mouths shut regarding Bitcoin (which they probably can't), Bitcoin could make a run for $75K by year-end,"" he said.However, technical setups on Bitcoin charts don't agree with bullish analysts.For instance, the BTC/USD exchange rate recently encountered higher selling pressure in the $40,000–$42,000 range. As a result, traders apprehensively treat the area as their cue to secure short-term profits, thereby risking declines toward the next points of support around $35,000, $32,000 and $30,000.Meanwhile, Bitcoin's 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA) — the blue wave on the chart below — is hinting at closing below its 200-day simple moving average (200-day SMA) — the saffron wave. The crossover is called a ""death cross,"" an indicator notorious for predicting advanced price declines across financial markets.""Whenever a Death Cross occurs, Bitcoin experiences deeper downside,"" noted Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous market analyst. ""In 2014, a Death Cross preceded an extra -71% drop. In 2017, an extra -65% drop. In 2019, an extra -55% drop.""Related: Here’s how Bitcoin’s impending death cross could be a contrarian buy signalThe trader added that a death cross remains a scenario, not a prediction, hinting that the price of Bitcoin might recover higher despite the bearish indicator's potential appearance in the coming days."
499,"Twitter CEO and crypto proponent Jack Dorsey has highlighted the efforts of a group entrepreneurs who are pushing the Ethiopian government to embrace Bitcoin (BTC).In a Wednesday tweet, Dorsey shared a Twitter thread from Project Mano, a group of Ethiopian-based entrepreneurs that are trying to get the government to consider mining and storing Bitcoin.#bitcoin https://t.co/jQSnJr5bv8Dorsey appears to have given the project some helpful exposure, with Project Mano’s Twitter followers doubling from 500 when he shared the thread to around 1,000 at the time of writing.Project Mano noted in a Tuesday Twitter thread that “for the last 6 months or so,” the group has been working to push the Ethiopian government to “combat the rising inequalities and global inflation” by adopting Bitcoin.The project's website outlines three Bitcoin-based initiatives that it is urging the Ethiopian government to adopt: mining, hodling and linking Bitcoin to the Ethiopian birr or other legal tenders.In our research, through the mining initiative, Ethiopia could easily multiply its export earnings without third-party involvement. Billions more in short term with minimal investment. The project aims to publish more detailed plans both for the government

3/4The project noted that if the proposed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is successful, not only will it be able to provide Ethiopian residents with round-the-clock electricity, but if also repurposed for Bitcoin mining, it could potentially “produce billions of dollars a year” for the economy.Interestingly, Project Mano is proposing that if Bitcoin mining were to be successful in Ethiopia, the government could also leverage decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols to increase the buying power of its Bitcoin holdings.According to Project Mano, hodling Bitcoin could also be used as a hedge against the inflation rate of the Ethiopian birr, and it noted that the only way it sees Ethiopia increasing the nation's gross domestic product is by outpacing the U.S. dollar’s inflation rate:“If the Ethiopian economy is only growing 7% a year, we are not catching up to the rate we need to break even,” it added.Related: Tanzanian president urges central bank to prepare for cryptoAccording to the World Bank Group, Ethiopia is the fastest growing economy in the African continent; however, it is also “one of the poorest, with a per capita income of $850.”It appears that crypto regulation hasn’t been of primordial importance to Ethiopia in the past, though it has taken a proactive approach in some instances.In particular, the Ethiopian government signed an agreement with Charles Hoskinson’s Cardano that enabled Ethiopian developers to apply blockchain technology to the country’s agritech industry back in 2018.In April, the government began working with the research and development arm behind Cardano, Input Output Hong Kong, to create a tamper-proof record of the educational performance of 5 million students across 3,500 schools in Ethiopia."
500,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors continue to hodl BTC at $40,000, even if they bought it at lower levels earlier in 2021.In the latest edition of its newsletter, “The Week On-Chain,” on Monday, on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode revealed that buyers from the first months of this year’s bull market are refusing to cash out.Bitcoin has been marked by low volume in recent weeks as price action remained rangebound between $30,000 and $41,000.The past few days has seen modest volatility return, but for most hodlers, there are few opportunities for profiteering under current circumstances.Glassnode suggests that this is clear by looking at so-called Hodl Waves, an indicator that shows what proportion of the Bitcoin supply last moved. These are based on Bitcoin’s realized cap, a measure of the market capitalization that takes into account the price at which each coin last traded.Hodl Waves confirm that, in part thanks to low volatility, the Bitcoin supply is ageing, and few investors are selling.“Not only are we seeing a decline in very young coins (As such, even coins now in profit by a significant percentage, if not double their buy-in price, remain dormant.“Some LTHs (long-term holders) have and will take profits on their coins,” Glassnode acknowledged.Long or short term, investors with smaller overall holdings are growing.As Glassnode subsequently noted this week, wallets with less than 1 BTC continue to make up more and more of the overall Bitcoin supply.Related: Bitcoin price bottom is in, says Fidelity exec as crypto market exits ‘extreme fear’“The response of 'the little guy’ to the evolution of Bitcoin as an asset can be seen in the supply distribution,” the company posted on Twitter Wednesday.While institutional and now even state adoption of Bitcoin compose most of the headlines when it comes to expanding influence, it is individual small-scale investors who are making noticeable inroads into the market this year."

502,"El Salvador’s Minister of Labor and Social Welfare has said that the country is not yet ready to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) for salary payments.In a Wednesday tweet, Rolando Castro denied local reports which claimed that his ministry had begun analyzing the possibility of Bitcoin-based salaries with officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy on Monday. Castro stressed that he was just answering a question, stating that it was “too premature to talk about wages.” The official added that he is now focused on finding more and better jobs for El Salvadoreans. “Monetary issues fall under the economic cabinet, and I’m not part of it,” he noted.The minister's remarks came a week after El Salvador passed President Nayib Bukele’s bill making Bitcoin legal tender in the country.

It’s still unclear whether the approval of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador would expand upon existing law or replace it. President Nayib Bukele’s draft of the law states that “tax contributions can be paid in Bitcoin” and “for accounting purposes, the USD will be used as the reference currency.”"
503,"Traditional hedge funds are willing to increase their exposure in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency markets over the next five years, a new survey has found.Intertrust Global, an international trust and corporate management company, polled the chief financial officers of 100 hedge funds globally about their intention to purchase crypto assets. About 98% of them responded that they expect their hedge funds to have invested 7.2% of their assets in cryptocurrencies by 2026.The survey found that a 7.2% investment into the cryptocurrency sector would equal about $312 billion if replicated across the sector. Meanwhile, about 17% of the polled CFOs admitted that their hedge fund could have 10% of their assets allocated to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC).The results appeared as Bitcoin corrected by more than 50% after rallying from $3,858 in March 2020 to almost $65,000 in April 2021, leading to speculations that it would crash further due to overvaluation.Nevertheless, the flagship cryptocurrency held through technical supports around $30,000 and, earlier this week, rallied back above $40,000.A majority of Bitcoin’s gains came on the back of anti-inflation narratives that became popular in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic-led March 2020’s global market crash.Global central banks responded with unprecedented monetary support, with the United States Federal Reserve launching a near-zero lending rate policy alongside a $120-billion monthly asset purchase program.The central bank’s decision crashed yields on U.S. government bonds to record lows. Meanwhile, liquidity injections into the economy, accelerated further by the White House-led trillions of dollars worth of stimulus aid, also pushed the dollar’s value lower against its top rival fiat currencies. Many investors turned to riskier safe-haven assets that benefited U.S. stocks, gold, silver and Bitcoin. Out of all, Bitcoin delivered the best bull runs as the Fed’s money-printing policies continued.Many mainstream fund managers appeared at the forefront of Bitcoin’s 2020 price boom. For example, billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones of hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation said last year that he holds small percentages of Bitcoin. Later, another legendary investor, Stan Druckenmiller, also revealed that he is invested in the benchmark cryptocurrency to offset inflation risk.European hedge fund management company Brevan Howard, U.S. fund firms SkyBridge Capital, Fidelity Investments and ARK Invest have also turned into some of the biggest Bitcoin backers from the traditional finance sector.Intertrust’s survey also showed that all the surveyed executives in Europe, North America and the United Kingdom have at least 1% exposure in Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies. It further noted that North American hedge funds would likely have an average exposure of 10.6% in cryptocurrencies compared to those in the U.K. and Europe that anticipated 6.8% exposure.The Intertrust survey also came as inflation in the U.S. reached 5% in May for the first time since 1992, reported the U.S. Labor Department in its monthly Consumer Price Index report.Many analysts, including Randall Kroszner, a professor at the University of Chicago business school and a former Fed governor, noted that higher inflation would lead the Fed to withdraw its expansionary policies to some extent. The speculation over “tapering” also rose as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began its two-day meeting on Tuesday.But so far, a majority of FOMC officials, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have treated the recent CPI spike as “transitory.” ANZ economist Tom Kenny noted that the U.S. central bank would, therefore, keep its policies unchanged at least until it sees improvements in the labor data.Meanwhile, Tudor Jones said in his recent interview with CNBC that he had increased his Bitcoin holdings from 1%–2% in 2020 to 5% after noticing the Fed’s disapproval of recent inflation spikes. He noted:"
504,"The recent crackdown on crypto mining in China has seen concerns expressed over the potential impact a hashrate migration could have on Texas’ unreliable electricity market, as an increasing number of dislocated miners eye the Lone Star State.Texas’ abundant sources of renewable energy and highly deregulated power grid make the state an obvious choice for migrating miners from China and elsewhere, with 20% of Texan electricity being generated by wind as of 2019.Speaking to CNBC, Brandon Arvanaghi, a former security engineer at crypto exchange Gemini, predicted Texas will see “a dramatic shift over the next few months” as miners look to set up shop.“We have governors like Greg Abbott in Texas who are promoting mining. It is going to become a real industry in the United States, which is going to be incredible,” he said, adding:Castle Island Ventures' founding partner, Nic Carter told CNBC that half of the world's hashing power could ultimately exit China’s borders and will need new homes, stating:Global hash rate has fallen by one-third since early May following reports that China’s mining industry would be subjected to stricter supervision.But is the Texan power grid up to the challenge of providing power for an influx of more crypto miners? The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has just requested that Texans curb their electricity usage amid the recent heatwave that saw many residents turning up their air conditioners earlier this week.Roughly 12,000 megawatts of generation capacity was offline as of Monday — enough to power 2.5 million homes. ERCOT described the scale of forced outages as “very concerning.”The regulator warned that a failure to heed the request could result in a repeat of the widespread winter power failures that left 69% of Texans without electricity, and roughly half without water in February. According to Buzzfeed, February’s outages could have resulted in up to 700 deaths in the state.Angela Walch, a Texas research associate at University College London’s Centre for Blockchain Technologies, tweeted her concerns regarding the share of Texas’ electricity being devoted to Bitcoin mining, emphasizing that her family has been “asked to reduce our air conditioning use, not run washing machines & dryers, etc.”Obviously, Bitcoin is not the sole cause of this cluster*^% that our poor political leadership in Texas has caused.

But, I am curious to know the portion of the grid it uses. Maybe Bitcoin miners are the first to be shut down in times of grid stress.However Tierion CEO Wayne Vaughan responded by asserting that much of the electricity used to power Texan mining operations comprised stranded resources that “would never be able to reach your home to power your appliances.”Others argued that wholesale Bitcoin mining operations could actually alleviate Texas’ power issues, with Texas’ seasonal surges in electricity demand incentivizing miners to sell power back to the state’s grid that otherwise go uncaptured.In September 2020, the Peter Thiel-backed crypto miner Layer1 in West Texas reported it had reaped profits exceeding 700% by selling renewable electricity back to the grid amid surging summer demand.While up-to-date data for global hashrate distribution is not available, the Cambridge University’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (BECI) estimates that China represented 65% of the world’s hashing power as of April 2020.Earlier this month, district regulators in Western Xinjiang and Yunnan issued notices mandating the suspension of virtual currency mining enterprises. BECI estimates the two regions account for 40% of the country’s hash rate."
505,"MicroStrategy chief Michael Saylor has room in his heart for other cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin, the billionaire revealed on an episode of CNBC’s Fast Money, in which he aired his views on the industry and where he sees things going in the future.In the interview with CNBC’s senior retail reporter Courtney Reagan on Tuesday, Saylor was initially asked why the software firm keeps buying BTC. The question referred to the company's June 14 announcement it may sell up to $1 billion worth of stock for further BTC acquisitions.Saylor described Bitcoin as “digital gold on a big tech network,” predicting it will be adopted by billions of people worldwide.Thanks @CourtReagan & @GuyAdami for inviting me on @CNBCFastMoney to discuss our #Bitcoin strategy, increasing institutional adoption of BTC vs. Gold as an inflation hedge, $MSTR capital markets strategy, and the future of the crypto-industry. https://t.co/OY3wtGNna0Perhaps the most interesting comments in the interview however came when Fast Money co-host Guy Adami bought up the topic of ""Bitcoin maximalism"" after Googling the term. He probed Saylor for his thoughts on Ethereum an asking if there was room in the firm’s strategy for ETH too.Saylor said he saw Bitcoin as “digital property” and the most valuable and dominant network, comparing it to the building block foundations of the ecosystem:He added that “Ethereum wants to dematerialize the JP Morgan building and the banking establishment and all of the exchanges,”He asserted that there was a place for different crypto assets, adding: “I think that as the market starts to understand these things, there’s a place for everybody.”The software firm CEO did not suggest the company would be making any moves to buy up Ethereum or any other crypto assets in the near future, however.Related: MicroStrategy stock slides after announcing new $400M debt raise to buy BitcoinIn a Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, MicroStrategy said it would be launching an “at the market” securities offering, which would allow it to sell up to $1 billion of its stock over time.On June 9, the firm announced that it had completed its $500 million offering of secured notes, and said it plans to use the proceeds to purchase more Bitcoin.Saylor outlined his thinking in a poll of his 1.2 million Twitter followers, asking them whether they thought BTC prices would exceed 6.125% over the next seven years (which is how much MicroStrategy has to pay back to bond buyers over the period). Ninety percent of the 105,000 respondents had voted yes at the time of writing.Do you expect the price of #bitcoin to appreciate more than 6.125% annually over the next seven years?Bitcoin Treasuries reports that MicroStrategy currently holds 92,079 BTC which is worth $3.68 billion at current prices."
506,"A new survey suggests Brits have become more eager to invest in cryptocurrencies than in traditional stocks and shares-based investments.United Kingdom investment firm AJ Bell’s survey found that 7% of British adult respondents reported they had bought crypto over the last year, compared to 5% who invested in stocks and shares individual savings accounts (ISA). A stocks and shares ISA is a type of savings account that lets users invest without ever paying tax on any income or capital gains.The survey was conducted by online market research tracker Find Out Now and polled 1,269 respondents. Laith Khalaf, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, commented that the results overturned common perceptions:The poll found that crypto investors are predominantly male and under 35, and 71% of those who said they had bought crypto assets claimed to have made a profit, while 12% reported making a loss in the past year. Amusingly, 17% said they did not even know what they had made or lost with their crypto investments.The survey seems to be in contrast to research from U.K. think tank Parliament Street in March that revealed that 52% of the 2,000 respondents in that particular survey expressed that they are more likely to invest in the stock market and traditional assets such as gold than in crypto, with a third stating they will not invest in crypto, as they believe they have already “missed the boat.”U.K. finance outlet This is Money reported that AJ Bell’s analyst stated the new research showed that younger people have more confidence in their understanding of cryptocurrencies, but Khalaf remained skeptical of them personally, “It certainly looks like some consumers are jumping into the deep end with cryptocurrencies, before learning how to swim in shallower waters.”Khalaf recommended investing in a diversified portfolio that is not overexposed to crypto, adding:Related: UK Starling bank to resume crypto exchange deposits in late JuneThe analyst commented on Elon Musk’s influence over Bitcoin markets, referring to some of his recent tweets and stating that “they are hardly a measure of wider business sentiment towards Bitcoin.”The U.K.’s Express reported that Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs data published last week is another sign that the current cryptocurrency investing frenzy is showing no signs of slowing down."
507,"More than $6.5 billion worth of BTC — or close to 1% of the crypto asset’s entire capitalization — is held by 19 publicly-listed companies. A further 5.75% of Bitcoin’s market cap is held by exchange-traded products and closed-ended trusts.The figures are contained in a new study by Nickel Digital Asset Management. The 19 firms cited are worth a combined market cap of more than $1 trillion, with 13 based in North America, three domiciled in Europe, and the remainder in Turkey, Hong Kong, and Australia. Seventeen other listed companies have purchased BTC, however details regarding their allocations are not available.The study shows that institutional adoption of crypto is on the rise, with eight listed companies purchasing Bitcoin during the first four months of 2021 compared to seven during all of 2020.Beyond the treasuries of listed firms, the study identified that $43.2 billion worth of BTC — equivalent to nearly 6% of Bitcoin’s market cap — is held by ETPs and trusts. In Hedgeweek, Nickel’s CEO and co-founder, Anatoly Crachilov argued that a combination of the COVID-19 crisis and expansionary monetary policies from central banks has heightened the risk of currency debasement, adding:Research from Nickel carried out earlier in the year, prior to the recent downturn, suggests institutional crypto allocations will continue to grow, with 81% of European wealth managers and institutional investors indicating they expect to see an increase in Bitcoin held among corporate reserves. Crachilov asserted the growing trend of institutions allocating Bitcoin to their treasuries will tame crypto’s price volatility over time. “Increasing allocations by large-scale institutional and corporate players is expected to lead to a reduction of this volatility over time, thanks to a longer-term, stickier type of capital brought by those investors, as well as a much larger liquidity pool of crypto ecosystem,” he said.However, not everyone agrees that institutions are champing at the bit to gain exposure to crypto, with JPMorgan analyst, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou asserting the recent premium observed in the spot markets over futures prices indicates institutional demand is waning.According to BitcoinTreasuries, a further $13.5 billion worth of BTC (1.8% of Bitcoin’s supply) is held in the treasuries of four private companies — Block.One, The Tezos Foundation, Mt Gox, and Stone Ridge Holdings Group.The website also estimates the government of Bulgaria is sitting on roughly $8.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, while Ukraine’s government hotels $1.8 billion in BTC."
508,"The overall mood of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is muted on June 15 with most altcoins trading flat while Bitcoin (BTC) bulls look for a daily close above $41,000 as a sign that the market could be shifting in favor of bulls.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that within the last few hours Bitcoin price rallied to $41,330 but the breakout was swiftly met by selling at overhead resistance levels.Another gauge of investor sentiment as highlighted by Rekt Capital is the 200 exponential moving average (EMA), which Bitcoin attempted to surpass on Tuesday but was firmly rejected.

509,"Bitcoin started the week with a strong breakout to $40,900, but today bulls are trying to hold Bitcoin price above the $40,000 level. As the price broke from the $31,000 to $39,000 range on June 14, traders speculated that setting a daily higher high and a close above $41,000 would set BTC up for a move to $47,000, but a lack of sustained buy volume and the much-discussed possibility of a death cross between the 50- and 200-day moving average are factors that could be keeping traders cautious.According to Simon Peters, an analyst at eToro:While sentiment has improved and futures premiums have recovered after nearly entering backwardation last week, analysts are unable to confirm that the bull trend has resumed.Peters said:Regarding the lack of follow-through from Bitcoin’s June 14 pump, Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman shared the above chart and said that while the 25% delta skew is no longer signaling that extreme fear exists in the market. Pechman said:Even though day traders are on the fence about the status of the trend, a number of on-chain metrics, including the Hodler Net Position Change, show that investors still view the recent dip to $30,000 and Bitcoin’s current price at $40,250 as excellent purchasing opportunities.HODLer Net Position Change has flipped green for the first time since October. pic.twitter.com/0hhjXrSdmF"
510,"When Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed his company’s Bitcoin (BTC) exposure and announced the launch of crypto payments, BTC took off to reach its all-time high. Shortly thereafter, however, Musk started tweeting about concerns over BTC’s environmental impact and Tesla reversing its crypto payments policy, leading to Bitcoin losing half of its value and the entire crypto market capitulating. In short, Musk tweets lukewarm support for crypto, and the prices go up; Musk posts a meme hinting at his “breakup” with Bitcoin, and the prices go down.For a sector that prizes disintermediation and wide distribution of economic power above all else, the cryptocurrency space has handed a single man way too much sway over its fortunes. The hope is that, sooner rather than later, the crypto market will get over its Musk addiction. At this point, however, the tech mogul’s Twitter talk is one of the most influential exogenous factors moving digital asset prices.At the end of the day, who is Mr. Musk to the crypto industry — an eccentric friend, an adversary, or simply a billionaire having some unfettered fun playing around with a trillion-dollar market?While it is impossible to know what’s on the controversial billionaire’s mind, there is some room for appraisals of what his presence can mean for the industry in the long run — as well as educated guesses about his stances and motivations.As of today, Musk’s influence on crypto asset values shows no signs of receding. Most recently, Musk tweeted a response to a Cointelegraph article where he, passingly, articulated the conditions that can lead to Tesla resuming the practice of accepting Bitcoin transactions. And guess what happened next? That’s right: Bitcoin had recovered a couple of thousand dollars overnight.That is just what pertains to BTC and can thus be considered “serious.” A separate chapter of the Musk-crypto saga is his — presumably, tongue-in-cheek — involvement with various altcoins that can multiply their market capitalizations within hours in response to his tweets. From systematically propping up the memecoin-in-chief Dogecoin (DOGE) to going for more obscure yet poignant items, such as the porn industry-affiliated coin CumRocket (CUMMIES), Musk has had a hand in quite a few price movements.The adverse effects of Musk’s antics on the crypto industry are well-documented. First and foremost, there are retail investors who took inspiration from Tesla’s CEO to make trades that cost them more than they could afford to lose. There are surely many more who have taken losses even without taking heed from Musk directly, falling victim to market-wide slumps that his escapades had triggered.On the scale of the industry, recent volatility storms get in the way of further forging the digital asset reputation as a mature and safe asset class. As a newcomer looking for an alternative place to park your money, how likely would you be to get excited about an investment that can drop 40% in a day following a random tweet? A related concern is that such malleability to potentially malign market manipulation can attract unwanted regulatory attention to the cryptocurrency space.Related: I spy with my laser eye: A Twitter phenomenon to make Bitcoin mainstream?Some still believe that there is an upside to the volatility that Musk perpetuates, as Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of financial advisory firm Quantum Economics, told Cointelegraph, “Musk’s involvement in the crypto space is a net positive. Volatility has long been hailed as a driver of volumes and with the adoption.”However, others subscribe to the view that whatever benign outcomes have come out of Musk’s crypto-related publicity, the negatives prevail by a wide margin. Dean Steinbeck, co-founder and chief operating officer of blockchain solutions provider Horizen Labs, told Cointelegraph:Steinbeck further opined that Musk is “nothing more than a sociopathic billionaire who knows virtually nothing about crypto but believes he is an expert.”Many in the crypto space wonder what is Musk’s motivation for cranking out often contradictory yet reliably market-moving tweets. Could it be as low and coarse as manipulating coin prices for gain? Or, perhaps, the tweets are a byproduct of a good-faith learning process with all its bumps and turns? Or is much of it just for fun?The fun hypothesis appears to be particularly influential, and some crypto market participants are not amused with it.Other crypto influencers, however, are willing to give Tesla’s CEO the benefit of the doubt. Brock Pierce, cryptocurrency investor and chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, doesn’t think that Musk’s actions affecting digital assets are ill-intentioned, telling Cointelegraph:Pierce added that because the cryptocurrency community tends to be forgiving, there is still a chance that Musk could be a very important advocate for the space, provided that his intentions prove to be true over the medium and long term.Related: Death knell for Chinese crypto miners? Rigs on the move after gov’t crackdownOpinions widely diverge with regard to the latter prospect. When asked if Musk has ruined his reputation with the crypto community for good, Greenspan responded:Greenspan summarized the popular sentiment by saying that, while many are happy to follow along for the laughs, most are in fact jaded.If the latter is the case for a critical mass of crypto market participants, this could be good news. It will take considerable “Musk fatigue” to break the “Musk spell” and liberate the entire asset class from the whimsical influence of a single powerful person."
511,"A Russian State Duma member has blasted the central bank’s tough stance on the cryptocurrency industry for ignoring the growing demand for crypto in the country.Fedot Tumusov, a member of the “A Just Russia” party representing the Siberian region of Yakutsk, has criticized the Bank of Russia’s approach to regulating the crypto industry following a Tuesday plenary meeting of the State Duma.In a Tuesday Telegram post, Tumusov outlined the growing need to create an ecosystem that allows Russian residents to purchase cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) amid increasing demand. The official argued that despite Russia enforcing crypto legislation earlier this year, the Bank of Russia has been negligent, refusing to authorize local banks to offer crypto investment services.Tumusov said that central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina has been speaking openly about the bank’s reluctance to deal with decentralized cryptocurrencies, focusing on a state-controlled digital ruble instead. “Reluctance or not, this will not change the situation. It is necessary not to struggle with the reality but rather to adjust to it, to respond to the challenges of the time,” Tumusov argued.The lawmaker noted that many countries around the world offer clear tax laws and policies that allow the industry to develop. He stated that Russia needs methods to deal with crypto that aren’t just prohibitions:Related: Russian Bitcoin critic says he would have bought BTC for 100 rublesTumusov’s remarks on crypto come shortly after reports confirmed that major Russian banks such as private bank Tinkoff have been unable to offer crypto services due to the Bank of Russia’s tough stance on digital assets. Meanwhile, state-backed commercial banks such as Sberbank and VTB largely criticize the industry, claiming that they don’t like Bitcoin because it’s too risky.While Russian banks are hesitant to dive into digital assets, major crypto companies like Binance have established a presence in the country. According to a June report by crypto intelligence firm Chainalysis, Russia is ranked the fifth-largest country in the world according to its estimated realized Bitcoin gains in 2020, following the United States, China, Japan and the United Kingdom."
512,"A new survey of 100 chief financial officers at hedge funds worldwide has indicated that the sector is planning a significant increase in its exposure to crypto assets in the near term.The survey, conducted by Intertrust, suggests that if the respondents’ forecasts were broadly mirrored across the sector, assets in crypto held by global hedge funds could hit $312 billion. United States-based funds were most bullish about the new asset class, expecting to raise their portfolio exposure to crypto to 10.6% on average within five years.Their European Union- and United Kingdom-based counterparts gave a slightly more modest figure, although still significant: 6.8% on average. Intertrust’s sample included chief financial officers of funds that each manage an average of $7.2 billion in assets. The CFOs themselves personally expected to have a minimum of 1% of their portfolios in crypto.High-profile hedge fund managers such as Paul Tudor Jones have been vocal advocates of Bitcoin (BTC) amid concerns about inflationary tendencies in the economy. SkyBridge Capital CEO Anthony Scaramucci takes a similar view of Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value, considering it superior to gold.

He also owns a 25% stake with One River Digital Asset Management. There have also been reports of Brevan Howard’s plans to directly invest in crypto.Aside from traditional hedge funds’ increasing confidence in the asset class, there are also a number of attempts to launch new crypto funds in the hope of replicating the successes of Bitwise and Grayscale."
513,"Bitcoin (BTC) has already hit its price bottom, one of the industry’s top executives believes as BTC price action stays above $40,000.In a tweet on Monda, Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at U.S. multinational financial services corporation Fidelity Investments, called time on any further Bitcoin price dips.BTC/USD maintained higher levels overnight on Monday after surging through $40,000 resistance. Despite not yet fulfilling traders’ predictions of a $47,000 push, the mood has become broadly positive on the back of fresh high-profile praise from the likes of Elon Musk and Paul Tudor Jones.For Timmer, the time has come to look higher, not lower, when it comes to charting Bitcoin’s next move.“In my view, it looks like the bottom is in,” he summarized.Timmer uploaded a chart comparing BTC/USD with the GS Retail favorites basket, a relationship that highlights similar local bottom formations.Fidelity has increased its Bitcoin activities in recent times, releasing a dedicated analytics platform and even applying to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF). United State regulators began scrutinizing the application in late May.Meanwhile, another aspect of cryptocurrency, which is back near 40, is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index — a classic sentiment gauge adding to the bullish mood.Related: A Bitcoin indicator with a 'perfect' history just told you to buy the dipAfter hitting its lowest in more than a year in recent week, Fear & Greed has rebounded to 38/100 — approaching neutral territory.The Index uses a basket of sentiment measures to determine whether traders are overly bullish or bearish at a certain price, and therefore whether tokens are oversold or conversely due for a sell-off."
514,"Despite Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider cryptocurrency market experiencing one of its worst crashes in recent memory, investors are apparently more bullish than ever regarding the future fortunes of Bitcoin and a host of altcoins.That’s according to the results of a Q2 retail investment survey conducted by crypto firm Voyager Digital, which polled 3,671 high-frequency traders on the Voyager platform.The survey’s findings revealed that 81% of respondents are more confident in the future of cryptocurrency, even after the violent price crash in April and May, which saw Bitcoin and others lose more than 50% of their value.Many coins have since recovered significantly, although the market still remains uncertain. Despite this, 87% of the survey’s respondents said they plan to increase their crypto holdings over the next quarter — an increase on the 80% who said the same in Q1.Some 39% of respondents said they expected the Bitcoin price to have fallen between $56,000 and $70,000 by the end of Q3 2021, while 28% predicted a Bitcoin price between $41,000 and $55,000. The percentage of respondents who believed Bitcoin would reach a price of $71,000 stood at 18%, down from the previous survey’s figure of 20%.Notably, more than nine out of 10 of those polled said they thought the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would eventually approve a Bitcoin ETF — an exchange-traded fund that crypto proponents believe will boost the value of Bitcoin through exposing it to institutional investment.Among the altcoins that respondents said they were most bullish on, Cardano (ADA) turned out to be the most popular. Some 55% said they were bullish on Cardano above any other altcoin, with Dogecoin (DOGE) coming in second (11%), followed by Chainlink’s LINK (6%) and Polkadot’s DOT (6%).Voyager Digital CEO Steve Ehrlich said it was encouraging to see continued faith in the cryptocurrency market despite the recent crash. Ehrlich suggested the results of the survey indicate that most investors view the recent market dip as a buying opportunity rather than a portent of worse to come.“The fact that the vast majority of our large sample size of investors are more confident in the future of cryptocurrency shows how people see May’s volatility in many crypto assets as a buying opportunity,” said Ehrlich.“Our findings show that 87% of investors are looking to increase their crypto holdings in the next quarter, a much higher percentage compared to the last survey we conducted in April,” he added."
515,"Elon Musk’s ability to move cryptocurrency markets with his tweets represents a danger to the average investor, said CoinSwap founder Erik Nurm, but the furor created around the Tesla CEO’s social media activity could draw more eyes to crypto in the long run.Nurm pointed out that Musk’s tendency to tweet about Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE) and other cryptocurrencies began shortly after the Tesla chief was banned from tweeting about his own company by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.“Elon has been manipulating the market by creating FUD around Bitcoin. He is playing the same game he did with the stock market,” said Nurm.“After he was banned by the SEC from tweeting about Tesla, he has shifted focus to the crypto market, where he can run free on social media for now,” he added.The CoinSwap founder sees turmoil in the markets at present largely thanks to the ever-changing temperament of Musk, which appears to run hot and cold. Earlier in the year, Musk announced Tesla would accept Bitcoin as a payment option for its electric cars, only to reverse his decision weeks later.More recently, Musk reversed his decision once again, announcing that Tesla would accept Bitcoin as a payment option once 50% of its mining was carried out with clean energy usage.Related: Elon Musk lays out when Tesla will begin accepting Bitcoin paymentsBut Musk’s erratic nature when interacting with the crypto world could ultimately attract more people to it in the long run, even if for the wrong reasons, said Nurm.“Even though Musk is temporarily causing turmoil in the market, his involvement could be beneficial for crypto in the long-term, as he is attracting new people to crypto, albeit for sometimes the wrong reasons,” he said.Nurm referenced Musk’s newest cryptocurrency plaything: CumRocket (CUMMIES), a token supposedly created for use in the adult film industry, which quadrupled in price in the space of 10 minutes when Musk began tweeting about it.“His efforts to drive up the price of certain coins, like Dogecoin and more recently CumRocket, are potentially more dangerous as these apparent pump-and-dump schemes could leave many ordinary people out of pocket.”Related: Primal arrogance and greed: Elon Musk slammed for crypto manipulationA pinch of sodium chloride is needed when interpreting Musk’s tweets, said Nurm, who added that the billionaire CEO may have ulterior motives when he gives the thumbs up or thumbs down on a given coin.“I hope people take all of Musk’s crypto tweets and other comments with a pinch of salt — and they must remember he has ulterior motives,” Nurm ended."
516,"MicroStrategy may be as smart as ever “buying the dip” in Bitcoin (BTC) as an indicator with a “perfect” history tells traders to buy.In a tweet on Tuesdsay, popular analyst Cole Garner flagged bullish signals for the Bitcoin-to-stablecoin ratio oscillator.After MicroStrategy announced plans to raise another $1.5 billion, the proceeds of which could be used entirely to purchase Bitcoin, BTC/USD cemented support at $40,000.The move followed praise from both Elon Musk and investor Paul Tudor Jones, the latter now advocating a 5% BTC position in comparison to the previous 1%.Currently, the Bitcoin-to-stablecoin ratio oscillator predicts a classic buying opportunity, even at new local highs.The oscillator measures the amount of Bitcoin on exchanges relative to the amount of stablecoins. According to Garner, when the ratio’s moving average enters a lower bound, shown in green on an accompanying chart, it’s time to enter BTC/USD.Since 2019, the indicator has not failed once at catching a bullish uptrend in Bitcoin.“A perfect BTFD hit rate since 2019, and it just printed another buy signal,” Garner commented.Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain monitoring resource CryptoQuant, which produces the indicator, nonetheless sounded the alarm over a possible fresh sell-off this week. This, he said, could come from Bitfinex, where a whale has amassed a significant short position.“If dumping happens again, it might come from Bitfinex,” Ki told Twitter followers.MicroStrategy committing more funds to Bitcoin, meanwhile, could be enough positive news in itself to buoy the market.Related: Bitcoin price could hit $85K in months as indicators flip bullish — ReportAs noted by Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite Decentrader, MicroStrategy buy-ins have uncanny timing when it comes to higher BTC spot rates.This, he told subscribers of his Telegram trading channel on Friday, was more like a “fractal” than a casual relationship.MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor continues to be vocal on Bitcoin amid the fundraising announcements, earning a significant platform on social media.“If you invest 5% of your portfolio in bitcoin, you have made the decision to invest 95% of your portfolio in assets getting demonetized by bitcoin,” he responded to Tudor Jones."
517,"Sometimes, all Bitcoin (BTC) needs to pump 10% is a positive remark from someone like Elon Musk.The Tesla CEO has been pointed to as the culprit for the recent downturn after the company’s May 12 announcement explaining that it would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to environmental concerns. Musk followed up by saying that he was looking into other cryptocurrencies that required 99% less energy consumption. However, on Sunday, the situation reversed as Musk reassured the public that Tesla did not sell any additional Bitcoin. The post also said that the electric car producer would resume taking BTC payments as soon as its Bitcoin mining relied on a minimum of 50% clean energy.While retail investors and algorithmic trading bots jump into action as soon as bullish or bearish signals and news flash, top traders tend to act more with more caution. Those who have been around the crypto markets long enough know that positive news might end up being ignored or severely downplayed in bear markets.On the other hand, even potentially negative news seems to have little to no impact during bull runs. For example, on Sept. 26, 2020, KuCoin was hacked for $150 million. The following week, on Oct. 1, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged BitMEX for operating an unregistered trading platform and violating Anti-Money Laundering regulations.Two weeks later, police reportedly questioned the founder of OKEx, forcing the exchange to suspend crypto withdrawals. Had this series of negative news happened while Bitcoin was flat or in a bearish phase, the price would have undoubtedly have stalled during a bear market.As shown above, Bitcoin barely had any negative impact in late September and October 2020. In fact, by the end of November 2020, Bitcoin was up 74% in two months. This is the main reason why top traders tend to ignore positive news during bear markets and vice-versa.A futures contract seller will usually demand a price premium to regular spot exchanges. This situation is not exclusive to crypto markets and happens in every derivatives market because in addition to the exchange liquidity risk, the seller is postponing settlement, and this results in a higher price.The three-month futures premium (basis rate) usually trades at a 5%–15% annualized premium in healthy markets. When futures are trading below the regular spot exchange price, it signals a short-term bearish sentiment.As shown above, the future basis has been below 11% since May 20 and flirting with bearish territory on multiple occasions as it tested 5%. The current level indicates a neutral position from top traders.The 25% delta skew compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options side-by-side. It will turn positive when the protective put options premium is higher than similar risk call options.The opposite holds when market makers are bullish and this causes the 25% delta skew indicator to enter the negative range.The above chart confirms that top traders, including arbitrage desks and market markers, are currently uncomfortable with Bitcoin’s price as the neutral-to-bearish put options premium is higher. However, the current 7% positive skew is far from the 20% exaggerated fear seen in late May.Derivatives markets show no evidence of top traders getting excited about the recent $40,000 hike. On the bright side, there is room for leverage buyers to mount positions. Stronger upswings usually occur when investors are least expecting, and the current scenario seems to be a perfect example.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

518,"Bitcoin (BTC) has risen above the psychological resistance at $40,000 following a series of positive news flow over the past week. The first bit of bullish news that impacted the price of Bitcoin was a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk who said the carmaker wil accept Bitcoin payments if more than 50% clean energy is used by Bitcoin miners with a “positive future trend.”Another piece of news that may have boosted the recovery in Bitcoin was Paul Tudor Jones' suggestion that 5% of every investment portfolio have exposure to Bitcoin,  which is equal to that of gold, cash and commodities. Jones was al critical of the U.S. Fed’s view that the current rise in inflation numbers is transitory.The recent bullish news is proof that the current drop has not altered the fundamentals of Bitcoin. Therefore, as the price stabilizes, Bitcoin may again attract institutional investment.Meanwhile, MicroStrategy has completed its $500 million offering of secured notes, which the company plans to use for buying Bitcoin. After deducting various expenses, the business intelligence firm is left with $488 million that will be used to purchase Bitcoin. This will add to the company's existing stack of 92,079 Bitcoin.Related: Bitcoin sell pressure may hit zero in July thanks to Grayscale’s giant 16K BTC unlockingWith demand likely to return, could Bitcoin lead the recovery in the crypto markets? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin turned up on June 13 and soared above the resistance line of the developing descending triangle pattern. This move invalidated the bearish setup, which is a bullish sign. The buyers have continued their purchase today and pushed the price above $40,000.The 20-day simple moving average ($36,779) has flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen into the positive territory, indicating that the selling pressure has reduced.The BTC/USDT pair could now attempt a rally to the 50-day SMA ($44,571), which may act as a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this resistance but finds support at the 20-day SMA, it will suggest the sentiment has turned bullish.A breakout of the 50-day SMA will signal a possible change in trend and the pair could then rally to $51,483. This bullish view will be negated if the pair turns down and plummets below the $34,600.36 support. Such a move will suggest that traders are dumping their positions on minor rallies.Ether (ETH) dropped below the support line of the symmetrical triangle on June 12 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests that buyers are accumulating on dips.The ETH/USDT pair rebounded off the trendline on June 13 and the bulls are now trying to push the price above the 20-day SMA ($2,581). If they succeed, the pair could rally to the resistance line of the triangle.A breakout and close above the triangle and the 50-day SMA ($2,940) will indicate that the downtrend is over. The pair could then move up to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,806.91.This positive view will invalidate if the pair turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below $2,200. That could open the doors for a fall to $2,079 and then $1,728.74.Binance Coin (BNB) bounced off the trendline on June 13 and the bulls have pushed the price above the 20-day SMA ($364). This suggests that the bulls are defending the trendline aggressively.If the bulls sustain the price above the 20-day SMA, the BNB/USDT pair may move up to $433. This level may act as a resistance but if the bulls can push the price above it, the ascending triangle pattern will complete.This bullish setup has a target objective at $609. The gradually rising 20-day SMA and the RSI above 46 suggest the buyers are trying to make a comeback.However, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the trendline, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. The pair could then drop to $291.06 and then to $211.70.Cardano (ADA) slipped below the trendline on June 11 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests that the bulls are buying on dips. The altcoin rose above the trendline on June 13 and the bulls are currently trying to push the price above the moving averages.If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to $1.94 where the bears are likely to pose a stiff challenge. However, a breakout and close above this resistance will suggest the correction is over.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the moving averages, the pair could again drop to $1.33. A break below this support will indicate weakness and the pair could then plummet to $1.Dogecoin (DOGE) is attempting to rebound off the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. This suggests the bulls are attempting to defend this support. If buyers push the price above the 20-day SMA ($0.34), the altcoin could start its journey to the 50-day SMA ($0.40).The bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the neckline and remain range-bound for a few days.The flattening moving averages and the RSI just below 46 points to a range-bound action in the near term. This neutral view will invalidate if buyers push the price above $0.45 or bears sink the pair below the neckline.XRP has been trading below the 20-day SMA ($0.92) for the past few days but the bears have not been able to sink the price below the $0.75 support. This suggests that bulls are accumulating at lower levels.The 20-day SMA is flattening out and the RSI is above 44, indicating the bulls are trying to make a comeback. A breakout and close above the 20-day SMA will be the first sign of strength. It will indicate that traders have resumed their purchases.That could push the price to $1.10 where the bears will try to defend the level aggressively. However, if buyers thrust the price above this level, the XRP/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($1.19). This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and plummets below $0.75.Polkadot’s (DOT) price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.The flattish 20-day SMA ($22.98) and the RSI above 48 points to a possible range-bound action in the short term. However, if bulls push the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the DOT/USDT pair may start a relief rally to $31.28 and then to $41.40.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the resistance line, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the pair below $19.50. If they succeed, the pair could start its journey toward the next critical support at $15.Uniswap (UNI) is trading between the $21.50 support and the $30 resistance for the past few days. Although the bears pulled the price below $21.50 on June 12 and 13, they could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests that the bulls purchased the dip below $21.50.The relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the downtrend line. This shows that the bears have not thrown in the towel yet. If the price turns down from the current level, the sellers will make another attempt to sink the UNI/USDT pair below the $21.50 to $20.23 support.If they succeed, the pair could drop to $16.49 and then $13.04. Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls push the price above the downtrend line, the pair may move up to the 20-day SMA ($25.45).If the price turns down from the 20-day SMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains negative. However, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day SMA, the pair could rise to $30.Litecoin (LTC) has failed to break above or below the symmetrical triangle as the bulls are buying on dips to the support line and bears are selling at the resistance line. If the price reaches the apex of the triangle without breaking out, the pattern will be invalidated.The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the resistance line. If they succeed in sustaining the price above the triangle, it will suggest that buyers are back in the game. That could open the doors for a move to $225 and then to the 50-day SMA ($237).Alternatively, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the LTC/USDT pair below the support line. If that happens, the pair could drop to $140 and then to $118.03.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading inside a descending triangle pattern for the past few days, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $538.11.If that happens, the BCH/USDT pair could witness aggressive selling and may drop to $400 and then to $370. The gradually downsloping 20-day SMA ($656) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls propel the price above the downtrend line. Such a move could catch several aggressive bears off guard and may result in a short squeeze, pushing the price to the 50-day SMA ($894).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

519,"All eyes are on Bitcoin (BTC), with the largest cryptocurrency shooting up past $40,000 on Monday. Unsurprisingly, the price increase happened shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the electric-car company would potentially accept BTC payments once more miners confirm green energy initiatives. Yet, while Musk’s tweet may have driven the price of Bitcoin up, some industry experts believe that Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency that should be leveraged. For example, during an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph at Bitcoin 2021 in Miami, Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Avanti Financial, said that unlike other cryptocurrencies, solvency matters more than leverage and liquidity when it comes to Bitcoin:In addition to advising that Bitcoin shouldn’t be leveraged, Long mentioned that there are new regulations for Bitcoin coming out of Washington, DC — something she believes has been coordinated with other government bodies. “It was Ray Dalio who said that Bitcoin's biggest threat is success — because that means the regulators are going to be cracking down,” said Long.Although this may be, Long pointed out that regulations will not ban Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, as long as users comply. She said:Long also noted that regulations around stablecoins are a priority for lawmakers. In particular, this will ensure that stablecoins don’t infect the U.S. dollar payment system with liquidity risk. To put this into perspective, Long mentioned the accidental hard fork that happened for a few hours on Ethereum during November 2020, saying:Moreover, Long commented on the risks associated with stablecoins back in May, warning that the entire stablecoin market has the potential to bring down other tokens upon a credit market correction."
520,"Investors tend to define the market as either bullish or bearish, but sometimes the price can remain within a specific range for an extended period. This type of sideways movement is not necessarily stable because cryptocurrency markets have high volatility that stems from a range of uncertainties and the early adoption cycle.For example, investors who concluded that the Bitcoin (BTC) bull run was over after the first week of 2021 probably regret that decision.Starting on Jan. 8, Bitcoin price traded in a descending channel within a $10,000 range. The movement lasted for 26 days until it finally broke out in early February.In August and September 2020, Bitcoin had two distinct ranging periods. However, it is not possible to consider those movements as a bull market. On the other hand, bears had few reasons to celebrate since the $10,000 bottom was tested multiple times, but the market recovered from it.Although it seems premature to call it, there is a possibility that Bitcoin has entered a positive range aiming for $40,000 by the end of June.The present range indicates a $37,000 to $43,000 range for June 25, but with crypto's extreme volatility, the channel's support and resistance levels are sometimes drastically tested.There is reason to believe that an impending short-squeeze could quickly recover a $50,000 support for Bitcoin, considering the $500 million raised by MicroStrategy and Paul Tudor Jones's intention to increase his BTC position.On the other hand, there are also fears that U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's remarks about digital assets being used for money laundering and illicit payments standing as a threat to Bitcoin price. Furthermore, Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair, recently expressed concerns about the absence of regulation on crypto exchanges.For options traders, the best option sometimes is to bet on maintaining the current range, especially for short-term periods. That's where the Christmas tree spread with puts strategy enters into play.Instead of betting on a bull or bear market, this option strategy uses protective put options to benefit traders with a neutral stance. The investor will profit if Bitcoin remains between $37,170 and $44,000 on June 25. Therefore, it offers protection both from an 8.5% move in either direction.To achieve this, one needs to buy 2 BTC worth of the $36,000 put, sell 3.33 BTC worth of the $40,000 put in addition to buying 1.33 BTC of the $46,000 put. Each contract is maturing on June 25.With less than 11 days left before the June 25 expiry, it is reasonable to assume that there is a good probability that the market stays within this range. However, this strategy offers a 0.062 BTC ($2,515 at $40,570) maximum loss in case of a surprise move.Profit-wise, the strategy can yield a 0.1375 BTC ($5,500) gain at $40,000.Therefore, it seems like a smart choice for an investor that expects the current uptick in bullish momentum to continue. It is worth noting that most derivative exchanges offer options trading from as little as 0.10 BTC.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

521,"Bitcoin (BTC) passed $40,000 on June 14 as a consolidation period snapped to unleash a solid breakout.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining 3% in under an hour, reaching $40,600 on Bitstamp.The largest cryptocurrency capitalized on the upside that resulted from a new positive tweet by Elon Musk concerning Tesla possibly accepting BTC in the future.Earlier, Cointelegraph reported on traders betting on a leg up to around $47,000 before a correction.A look at buy and sell positions on major exchange Binance shows support at $38,000, with resistance at $40,500 — the next hurdle for bulls.Bitcoin reached a $2 trillion market capitalization because of a ""dichotomy"" in Federal Reserve policy that ""questions"" its credibility, said famous trader Paul Tudor Jones.In an interview with CNBC on June 14, the founder of Tudor Investment Corporation sounded the alarm over advancing inflation.After last week's consumer price index (CPI) report showed that United States inflation has hit a 13-year high, Bitcoin's deflationary nature has rarely looked so appealing.For Jones, the idea that higher inflation is just temporary due to recent events — as suggested by the Fed and central banks in general — is a myth.""It's somewhat disingenuous to say that inflation is transitory — for them to say inflation is transitory,"" he told CNBC's Squawk Box segment.Today's environment is entirely different from those that saw episodes of inflation in the past, such as in 2013. As such, there is little sense in the Fed applying the same forecasts, Jones believes.Jones noted that the CPI was much lower then, while now, unemployment levels and job offers also roughly equal each other.Related: Paul Tudor Jones says Bitcoin is 'like investing early in Apple or Google'Meanwhile, gold and Bitcoin have provided a refuge for many. Despite the precious metal vastly underperforming Bitcoin in terms of gains, it remains near record highs.""When you look at the Fed today and the Fed back then, you wonder: How can you have such wildly different policy views on what constitutes the right levels for employment, the right levels for inflation?"" he continued.Ultimately, a 5% Bitcoin allocation is one of the only things he recommends to those seeking portfolio advice.""I say, 'OK, listen. The only thing that I know for certain is I want to have 5% in gold, 5% in Bitcoin, 5% in cash, 5% in commodities at this point in time,'"" he added."
522,"Institutional Bitcoin (BTC) investors are in the spotlight as an upcoming major cashout date sparks talk of fresh price volatility.As noted by popular Twitter commentator Loomdart and others this week, attention is focusing on buyers and sellers of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as Bitcoin hovers near $40,000.A giant in the institutional Bitcoin space, GBTC has over $24 billion in assets under management.It is not available constantly — as Cointelegraph reported, the trust operates with periodic closures, which this year have coincided with its buy-in price trading at a discount to spot price.This negative “GBTC premium” has formed a major talking point in its own right, as invested funds are locked up for a set period and then released, allowing investors to cash out at certain times depending on when they bought in.A combination of negative premium relative to spot and a large unlocking of funds means that July will be particularly interesting for BTC price action. Previously, such an alignment has meant increased volatility.July 19 will see the biggest single unlocking day, with 16,000 BTC ($627 million) released.For popular pseudonymous trader Loomdart, this nonetheless provides a chance for selling pressure to stabilize afterward, paving the way for BTC bulls to crush longstanding resistance lines.U guys realise we are already negating gbtc unlocks and after the bulk of them are over theres like... 0 spot btc sellers left right?This would form a refreshing counterpoint to the broadly bearish picture on institutional markets, with open interest in Bitcoin futures way down versus prior to the May price dip to $30,000.On-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant noted the decline in interest last week, something which, in turn, came in tandem with a dramatic decline in overall BTC transaction numbers."
523,"A run-up toward $40,000 in the Bitcoin (BTC) market risked exhaustion as Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s futures opened on Monday with a gap of $1,575, the first since May 17.In retrospect, the downside risks heightened due to Bitcoin’s recent bearish pullbacks near the $40,000 level. Atop that, the said CME gap formed between Friday’s close of $37,325 and Monday’s open of $38,900, raising possibilities that the next correction would prompt Bitcoin bids to fall to at least $37,325.That is due to a general psychological notion among traders that BTC/USD reverses its trends to fill Bitcoin futures gaps more than 90% of all time. So, for instance, traders partially filled a gap that appeared during the April 17–18 weekend session 11 days later.Similarly, in May 2020, the missing weekend candle between $8,795 and $10,010 was filled immediately after its formation.But throughout 2020 and entering 2021, the Bitcoin market’s supersonic uptrend left many missing price candles unfilled. The last of such big gaps appeared during the long Christmas weekend last year, about $2,900 long, between $23,745 and $26,650, which remains unfilled to this date. Similarly, another unfilled CME gap between $18,020 and $19,155 dates back to early December 2020.The maximum time traders have taken to fill a CME gap is three months — the missing price candle in focus appeared in June 2019 and was filled in September 2019.Macroeconomic fundamentals played a huge role between June and September 2019 in keeping Bitcoin prices away from its lower CME gaps. Firstly, many investors bought Bitcoin as their haven asset as the United States–China trade war weighed on global growth and market sentiment.Secondly, Facebook’s foray into the cryptocurrency sector with the launch of Libra created more upside opportunities for Bitcoin. In 2020, the Federal Reserve’s open-ended expansionary policy served as a bullish backstop for Bitcoin. The U.S. central bank brought its benchmark lending rates to almost zero following the March 2020 global market crash.At the same time, the Fed started buying government bonds and mortgage-backed securities at the rate of $120 billion per month. That sapped investors’ appetite for Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar and increased the appeal of Bitcoin, gold, and stocks as alternative safe havens.Veteran investors, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones, announced their exposure in the Bitcoin markets following the Fed’s expansionary moves. Meanwhile, Tesla, MicroStrategy, Square, Ruffer, Seetee and other corporate houses also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, citing inflation fears.That somewhat kept traders from filling the $23,745–26,650 and $18,020–19,155 CME gaps even five months upon their formation.Twitter-based market analyst, known by his Planet-of-the-Apes pseudonym, xCaeser, meanwhile suggested traders watch $34,000 as a borderline level for determining the next market bias. In a tweet published in the aftermath of the May 19 price crash, xCaeser noted that holding $34,000 as support would increase Bitcoin’s potential to rally toward $47,000. He added:Bitcoin has broken below $34,000 multiple times after May 19, but the cryptocurrency bounced back wildly after testing the $30,000–$32,000 area as its support following each of its bearish moves.After reaching almost $65,000 in mid-April, Bitcoin prices declined on profit-taking sentiment while leaving a CME gap between $49,215 and $45,295. The missing price candle stands unfilled to this date.That put Bitcoin in a conflicted technical setup — i.e., either Bitcoin could correct lower after approaching the $40,000 resistance level and fill the $37,325–$38,900 CME gap, or it could go continue heading higher to fill the $45,295–$49,215 CME gap.Exchange data fetched from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant further showed a brewing bias-conflict in the Bitcoin market. In retrospect, both BTC inflow and outflow from exchanges decreased in recent sessions. Meanwhile, the number of inflow addresses declined while the outflow addresses fell to hit a one-year low.Conflicted sentiment in $BTC negatively impacts exchanges withdrawals and deposits

- Inflow addresses are decreasing
- Outflow addresses are decreasing and hit a 1-year low of 15.5K

He told Cointelegraph:Musk’s tweets were instrumental in crashing Bitcoin prices from $43,500 to $30,000 on March 19. His company Tesla still holds about $1.3 billion in BTC as a cash alternative. "
524,"South Africa’s financial regulators are laying the groundwork for the “phased and structured” regulation of cryptocurrencies. The move presents a reversal of the largely hands-off approach taken for the past seven years and has been driven by increasingly high levels of retail interest in crypto in the country.In a position paper published on Friday, the country’s Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group, or IFWG, under the aegis of the Crypto Assets Regulatory Working Group, laid out a roadmap for introducing a regulatory framework that will center on crypto asset service providers.South Africa’s initial national policy toward crypto has until now been one of wariness but also noninterference. Back in 2014, the National Treasury issued a public statement dedicated to the issue, together with the South African Reserve Bank and the country’s financial regulator and financial intelligence and tax agencies. Its tone was cautionary but unintrusive, warning the public that it could trade crypto at its own risk and would be offered no legal protection or recourse in case of difficulties.Commentators have noted that several factors, including the South African crypto market’s surge to in excess of 2 billion rand ($147 million) in daily traded value earlier this year, have rendered this former policy untenable. IFWG’s new paper emphasizes that even though a structured regulatory framework is set to be phased in, crypto assets remain “inherently risky and volatile,” and the prospective financial losses incurred by crypto trading activities remain high.Six overarching principles will inform the country’s evolving approach. These entail taking an “activities-based perspective” that will ensure that a principle of “same activity, same risk” orients regulators’ decisions; implementing measures proportional to risk; taking a collaborative approach to crypto asset regulation; staying up to date with international best practices; and encouraging digital financial literacy, among consumers.The paper also puts forth 25 recommendations for how to regulate crypto in relation to three main areas of concern: Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism, cross-border financial laws and the application of financial sector laws. This last implies that South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority will be tasked with aiming to prevent market abuses — e.g., fraud and market misconduct, and taking action against relevant perpetrators in the industry.Related: Liquidators seek expanded probe of alleged South African Bitcoin schemeAlongside the published paper, IFGW issued a press release outlining its strategy, which gave space to its concerns about the nature of the asset class and surrounding ecosystem. IFGW pointed to decentralization as a downside, not a plus, which leaves consumers and traders without recourse to an authority or centralized entity that could resolve user errors — e.g., using the wrong crypto wallet address.IFGW also remains concerned about the manipulative nature of much crypto marketing material, assets’ price volatility and scam activities, such as Ponzi schemes. Indeed, this year the country’s largest-ever Ponzi scheme involved a company targeting Bitcoin (BTC) traders, which amassed 23,000 BTC in investor holdings from a reported 26,000 members worldwide."
525,"The United States’ largest cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, is setting up an office in New York. The Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange has subleased 30,000 square feet from Steven Cohen’s investment firm Point72 at Related Companies’ 55 Hudson Yards in New York, the New York Post reported on Sunday.A spokesperson for Coinbase confirmed the company's plans to establish an office in New York, stating, ""We will be opening a second office in NYC to support flexible work schedules as we are a remote-first company.""Citing sources from a real estate firm, the New York Post notes that Coinbase’s upcoming New York office makes up a small chunk of Point72’s total 339,000 square feet at the tower. The report also notes that the Hudson Yards area is mostly known for corporate, media and law tenants but not technology companies.“It’s a new brand of user not only for Related’s Hudson Yards but also for the entire far West Side area,” one market observer reportedly said.Coinbase became even more discussed this year after going public on Nasdaq in April. The firm is known for its no-headquarter stance officially announced by CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong in February 2021. Last month, Coinbase was planning to shut down its office in San Francisco in 2022 as part of the company’s commitment to “being remote first.”Related: Coinbase recruits former White House adviser to new policy roleArmstrong stressed that the closure of Coinbase’s headquarters in the Golden Gate City will be an important step in ensuring that no office becomes an unofficial headquarters. “Instead, we will offer a network of smaller offices for our employees to work from if they choose to,” he said.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Coinbase’s position on being remote-first echoes a similar no-headquarters stance by competitor Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said back in 2019 that office and headquarters are “old concepts like SMS and MMS.”Disclaimer: This article was updated to specify that Coinbase will be setting up its second office in New York."
526,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week on a pleasant high thanks to a boost from a familiar source, Elon Musk. Are the good times back?After spending weeks languishing close to $30,000, Bitcoin has managed to stage a sustained comeback to line up an attack on major resistance.With on-chain indicators flashing bullish, there may be a chance of a breakout, but analysts and traders are far from 100% convinced.Cointelegraph takes a look at five things that could influence how BTC price action unfolds in the coming days.The talk of the town, once again, is Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk this week.Firmly out of favor after playing the devil’s advocate on Twitter on multiple occasions, Musk returned to the fray with news that previously seemed unlikely.Tesla dropped Bitcoin payments earlier this year shortly after announcing them and without actually processing any BTC transactions. This, according to Musk, was due to the allegedly unsuitable energy usage involved in mining.Widely criticized for both his logic and its impact on Bitcoin price action, Musk did not give up, with subsequent tweets on various aspects of Bitcoin and altcoins producing discernible but comparatively muted price movements.Now, it appears the self-proclaimed “Technoking” has tweaked his social media approach once more.Responding to a complaint from Magda Wierzycka, CEO of financial services company Sygnia, he reopened the door to Tesla adopting Bitcoin once again. Wierzycka’s criticism of Musk’s Bitcoin impact was covered by Cointelegraph last week.“When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions,” Musk responded, adding that Tesla still had 90% of its initial $1.5-billion BTC purchase.BTC/USD relished the news, climbing past $39,000 to seal daily gains of over 12% at the time of writing.As Cointelegraph reported over the weekend, bulls’ case is being supported by a host of on-chain indicators.Covering price versus active addresses, spent output profit ratio (SOPR) and stock-to-flow, analytic tools firmly point to an undervalued Bitcoin at current prices.As such, predictions of a comeback in the short to mid-term are creeping in — one calls for $85,000 within the coming months, while stock-to-flow model creator PlanB still believes that $100,000 is plausible this year.On Monday, meanwhile, there are two other charts to consider — and one is a less frequent visitor than the other.Related: VORTECS Report: When this indicator lights up, LUNA, MATIC and EGLD usually gain 10%As noted by PlanB among others, Bitcoin’s mempool has seen a major reset this month, which means transactions are currently extremely cheap versus expected processing time.Not only is this a “great time” to reorganize and consolidate one’s BTC wallets, but as Cane Island Alternative Advisors investment manager Timothy Peterson argues, the mempool is now back where it was before Bitcoin began its parabolic rise in late 2020.“The bitcoin mempool is a good indicator of bubbles,” he summarized in a series of tweets on Sunday.Continuing, he warned that the lack of demand that the empty mempool reflects means price action “should” trend down in the coming months.This lack of demand, meanwhile, has become plainly noticeable on exchanges. As highlighted by on-chain monitoring resource CryptoQuant, both inflows and outflows from exchanges are down considerably.Traders waking up on Monday will be interested in one level in particular thanks to Bitcoin’s latest run-up.Having waited for a decisive move during weeks of price compression, there is now a real chance that they will witness an attack on $40,000 and potentially higher.This would be significant in itself — estimates broadly call for lower prices in the short term before a rebound, but Bitcoin has so far refused to conform.“Should do 1 more leg up before I expect some correction,” popular trader Crypto Ed said on Monday morning.He added that he would be waiting for lower levels to hit before a possible entry trade but that in the meantime, BTC/USD could hit as high as $47,000.Shorters came in for mockery, with Crypto Ed noting many would already be at a loss or liquidated against a backdrop of bullish sentiment and MicroStrategy about to purchase another $500 million of BTC.“How does that feel? Being underwater in your short position and realizing Saylor is ready to go for a new $500mm shopping spree?” he added, referring to the company’s CEO, Michael Saylor.At the time of writing, BTC/USD circled $39,500 after hitting local highs of $39,783 on Bitstamp.Away from on-chain, Bitcoin network fundamentals, meanwhile, look slightly less solid.As the Bitcoin energy debate rages on, miners continue to face pressure from China in particular, where a shakeout of who is allowed to mine using local energy is underway.Some see this as a crackdown and even ban on Bitcoin’s major mining power source, while others argue that miners, as ever, will simply adapt to the changes and move elsewhere. This could also result in a transfer of hash rate dominance to another jurisdiction.El Salvador, the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender, is already working on its own geothermal mining facilities, becoming the latest party in the so-called Bitcoin hash war.So far, however, the trend is down. According to monitoring resources, Bitcoin’s hash rate is shrinking, with 10 exahashes per second (EH/s) wiped off in recent days.Since the hash rate is an estimate, different sources have different numbers, with the current 113 EH/s representing roughly two-thirds of this year’s 168 EH/s all-time high.Difficulty, meanwhile, decreased by 5.3% on Sunday, with another decrease on the cards for the next automated readjustment in two weeks’ time.Related: Bitcoin price moves toward $40K as on-chain and technical analysis favor bullsFinally, for one hedge fund manager, there is nonetheless no sign of a Bitcoin price top.Alongside data from Bloomberg Intelligence, Dan Tapeiro, founder and CEO of DTAP Capital, volatility is simply too low to suggest that this is a local ceiling.“Bitcoin has never topped with volatility this low. Massive upside still ahead. Twtr sht termers too negative,” he said in part of a Twitter discussion on Monday.He added that despite Saylor and MicroStrategy, corporate adoption in the United States was “unlikely” but that Bitcoin was still the “biggest macro event of all time.”Countries like El Salvador, in addition, have huge potential to stage copycat moves.Tapeiro drew attention to Bloomberg’s assertion that $100,000 in 2021 would be a “meager” target for BTC/USD."
527,"A cryptocurrency ban is not the right solution for the Netherlands, the country’s finance minister reportedly said after a local official called for a total ban on crypto.The Netherlands should regulate the cryptocurrency market instead of prohibiting its citizens from using crypto entirely, Dutch minister of finance Wopke Hoekstra stated, according to a Friday report by local news agency NU.nl.The official still admitted to certain risks associated with the crypto market, reportedly saying that he understood the concerns raised by the director of the Dutch Bureau for Economic Analysis, Pieter Hasekamp. The minister stressed that it’s crucial to ensure proper rules for digital asset service providers in order to mitigate the risks around issues such as money laundering.“My observation is now that supervision is more effective than a total ban in the Netherlands,” Hoekstra stated, reportedly noting that it’s important to oversee the crypto market at the European level.Hoekstra also mentioned that he had already issued a warning regarding cryptocurrency-related risks back in 2017, stressing that crypto investors should realize that their bets on crypto are “entirely at their own expense and risk.”“That’s going very well now, but we’ve also seen big dips and peaks along the way,” Hoekstra said in November 2017 just a few weeks before Bitcoin (BTC) hit $20,000 for the first time in history in December.Related: Bitstamp imposes KYC for Dutch traders withdrawing to external walletsAs previously reported, Hasekamp argued in a Friday article that the Dutch government must enforce an immediate total ban on mining, trading and holding of Bitcoin. He cited the common anti-crypto arguments, claiming that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are unable to fulfill any of the three functions of money as a unit of account, means of payment or store of value.Some of the world’s biggest Bitcoin critics, such as the award-winning economist Nouriel Roubini, have already admitted that Bitcoin could serve as a store of value, which is a major function of money alongside a unit of account and a medium of exchange."
528,"Despite El Salvador’s recently passed law mandating Bitcoin as legal tender, local remittance firms are reportedly hesitant to adopt Bitcoin (BTC).Speaking to Reuters, Autonomous Research fintech analyst Kenneth Suchoski argued that remittance firms are unlikely to launch support for Bitcoin and other crypto assets until prompted to do so by customer demand, likely creating a stalemate for the local payments industry.“For Western Union and some of the other remittance providers, keep in mind that most of the volume in the remittance industry is going from developed markets to emerging markets primarily to people — families and friends — that operate in cash,” he said.Suchoski estimates that less than 1% of global cross-border remittances are conducted using crypto assets, adding:Global payments firm MoneyGram International also emphasized the challenge of navigating undeveloped infrastructure enabling ramps between crypto assets and local fiat currencies in emerging economies.“We’ve built a bridge to connect bitcoin and other digital currencies to local fiat currency,” a MoneyGram representative told Reuters, adding:Last month, MoneyGram revealed a partnership with Coinme to enable users to buy and sell crypto assets using U.S. dollars at 12,000 retail locations across the United States.Related: El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption may jeopardize IMF negotiations: JPMorganSuchoski also emphasized the compliance burden of supporting crypto assets for payments firms, noting that Western Union’s annual compliance costs had nearly doubled from around $100 million to $200 million over roughly the past decade."
529,"Tanzania appears to be the latest emerging economy poised to embrace Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto assets.On Monday, Tanzanian president Samia Suluhu Hassan urged the country’s central bank to begin exploring crypto assets. Hassan emphasized the increasing impact of digital assets on global finance, stating, “We have witnessed the emergence of a new journey through the internet.”She highlighted the lack of crypto adoption and development in the East African region, stating, “Throughout the region, including Tanzania, they have not accepted or started using these routes.”Hassan’s comments come on the heels of numerous lawmakers in Latin America pushing for greater crypto adoption in other emerging economies, including El Salvador — where Bitcoin has been mandated as legal tender.While African legislators have been slow to recognize and encourage the crypto economy, the region has been a hotspot for peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin trading for years.According to Useful Tulips, Sub-Saharan African is the second-largest region for P2P trading behind North America, representing roughly $16.5 million in weekly volume.Related: Latin lawmakers don lazer eyes on Twitter in support of BitcoinNigeria represents half of the region’s volume, ranking behind the United States as the second-largest nation by P2P Bitcoin trading, with $8.5 million in BTC changing hands weekly. Kenya is Africa’s second-ranked peer-to-peer market with more than $3 million in weekly trade, followed by Ghana with $2 million, and South Africa with $1.6 million.Tanzania ranks seventh for the region with nearly $90,000 worth of trade over the past seven days."
530,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price saw a bullish turn of events on Sunday as the price broke out to $39,252, but many analysts are still on the fence when it comes to determining whether the digital asset is ready to continue its uptrend. To date, the crypto market remains on edge and is two months removed from Bitcoin’s all-time high near $65,000. A market analysis from Delphi Digital identified a “major head and shoulders pattern” that could “spell more short term pain if BTC dives below $30,000.”With that in mind, now is a good time to review some key data points to gain a greater perspective on where Bitcoin’s price could go next.A 50% decrease in price over the past two months may seem extreme to those unfamiliar with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, but it comes as no surprise to the long-term hodlers who have seen multiple drawdowns of an even larger magnitude over the last decade. As seen in the chart above, a drawdown of 70% or greater is not uncommon for BTC, especially following a significant run-up in price, hinting that the possibility for further pain is still a threat as bulls battle bears in the mid-$30,000 range.The rapidly falling prices sent new and old Bitcoin holders running for the sidelines, resulting in traders selling at a loss according to Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) data highlighted by cryptocurrency analyst Filbfilb. In the past couple of days, signs of a SOPR reset have appeared, indicating that average wallets are now selling at a profit again. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index (CFGI) has also reached its lowest level since the March 2020 sell-off initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic.The high levels of fear currently being experienced by a majority of traders have many sitting on the sidelines as concerns of further losses remain a legitimate possibility.For the contrarian investors, however, low scores on the index are a signal to “be greedy when others are fearful,” as Warren Buffet would say, and the chart above shows that buying during high fear moments tends to be a good entry-level.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin’s impending death cross could be a contrarian buy signalWhile it’s true that Bitcoin has seen its price fall more than $30,000 over the past two months, it’s important to note that the amount it has fallen as well as its current price are nearly double the previous all-time high set in 2017, shining a light on just how significant the rally has been over the past six months.On-chain analysis from Decentrader shows that an “oversold” signal was recently triggered, “suggesting that BTC may soon be ready to turn around and move to the upside.”The active addresses sentiment indicator compares the 28-day change in price, shown by the orange line, with the 28-day change in on-chain active addresses, which is represented by the band of grey lines.The orange line moving from below the dotted green line back up into the active address change band is considered a bullish signal, and this most recently occurred on Thursday, indicating the possibility of a turnaround in the market.According to Rekt Capital, a popular analyst on Twitter, Bitcoin is still on a path to realize a new all-time high.The #BTC Halvings (blue) occur in the year prior to a new Candle 1

And Candle 1 is where $BTC experiences the most explosive growth

Whatever the FUD towards BTC is right now won't change the long-term effect that the BTC Halving has on Bitcoin's pricehttps://t.co/1NTrPs8wfW pic.twitter.com/F7C9P6ehMOFor now, perhaps it’s best to just take a break from staring at charts and worrying about which way Bitcoin will choose. The long-term outlook remains strong as countries like El Salvador have begun choosing BTC as legal tender and more people become interested in cryptocurrency.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

531,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price continues to be range-bound between $30,000 and $40,000 level for the past few days, which is not necessarily a bearish sign.Generally, after a sharp fall, the price tends to consolidate as the asset transfers from weaker hands to stronger hands. After the transition is complete, the asset breaks out and starts a new uptrend. Usually, the longer the price consolidates in a range, the stronger the next trending move will be.Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone said on Saturday that Bitcoin’s declining supply was a positive sign, which could act as a “bullish ace” for its move higher “if past patterns hold.”Yoni Assia, CEO of eToro, also told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin could see a sharp rise “over the next three to five years, as there are still 5 billion people in the world that basically don't have good local currency.”Related: Bitcoin price could hit $85K in months as indicators flip bullish — report.Therefore, investors should not be discouraged by the muted price action in the short term. Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain strong and are likely to result in a new uptrend in the future.As crypto markets consolidate, let’s analyze the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the next few days.Bitcoin turned down from the resistance line of the descending triangle on Jan. 12 and broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($36,586). This suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the resistance line.The longer the price stays below the 20-day EMA, the greater the chances of a drop to the lower levels. If bears sink the price below $34,600, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $33,400 and then to $31,000.A break and close below $31,000 will complete a descending triangle pattern, which has a target objective at $19,549. However, it is unlikely to be a straight drop to the lower levels because the bulls will attempt to stall the decline in the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone.This negative view will invalidate if the price continues to move up and rises above the resistance line of the triangle. Such a move could open the gates for a rise to the 50-day simple moving average ($44,709), which is again likely to act as a stiff resistance.A break above the 50-day SMA will suggest that the correction could be over and the bulls will gradually try to start a new up-move.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have been crossi each other and the relative strength index (RSI) is just above the midpoint, indicating that bulls are trying to make a comeback.A breakout and close above the resistance line of the triangle will signal that demand exceeds supply. If the bulls sustain the price above the triangle, a new up-move could begin.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the resistance line and breaks below $34,000, it could signal a minor advantage to the bears. That could pull the price down to the critical support at $31,000. A bounce off this support will suggest accumulation at lower levels and that could keep the pair inside the triangle for some more time.Aave is trading inside a large range between $280 and $581.67 for the past few months. The bulls have successfully defended the support of the range on five previous occasions, hence the buyers are likely to buy the dip once again.If the price rebounds off the current level with strength, it will suggest that the bulls continue to accumulate on dips. The buyers will then try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($344). If they succeed, the AAVE/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($414), which may act as a stiff hurdle.If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, the pair could consolidate between $280 and $414 for a few days. On the contrary, a break above the 50-day SMA will clear the path for a northward march toward $581.67.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the $280 support. That will embolden the bears who will then try to pull the price down to $208.09 and then to $160.The 4-hour chart shows the bears had pulled the price below $280 but they are struggling to sustain the lower levels. However, the moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $266.68, the pair could start its downward journey. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the downtrend line. Such a move will suggest the correction is over and the pair could then rise to $500.Kusama (KSM) has been witnessing volatile moves in the past few days. Although the bulls pushed the price above the $480 overhead resistance on June 9, they could not sustain the higher levels and the price dipped back below the level on June 10. This shows that bears are selling on rallies.However, the buyers have not allowed the price to break below the 20-day EMA ($388). This suggests that the sentiment is turning positive as the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-day EMA.The rising 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a minor advantage to the bulls. The buyers will now make one more attempt to push the price above $480. If they succeed, the KSM/USD pair could rally to $537 and then retest the all-time high at 625.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below $360. That could pull the price down to $280.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are trying to defend the trendline support. However, the 20-EMA has turned down and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating the bears have the upper hand.If the sellers sink the price below $380, the pair could drop to $342. A break below this support could result in a decline to $280.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push the price above $429. That could attract buying, pushing the pair to $480.Algorand (ALGO) bounced off the trendline on June 12 and rose above the 20-day EMA ($0.97), which suggests the bulls are buying on dips. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest the selling pressure has reduced.The price action of the past few days has formed an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $1.15. If the bulls manage to sustain the price above $1.15, the ALGO/USDT pair could rally to the target objective at $1.63.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $1.15, the pair may extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days. A breakdown and close below the trendline will nullify the bullish view and open the gates for a drop to $0.80 and then $0.67.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are attempting to push the price above the downtrend line. If they can sustain the breakout, the pair could rise to $1.15. A breakout and close above this resistance could start a new uptrend.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the price below the trendline. If they succeed, it will signal the start of a deeper correction.Theta Fuel (TFUEL) soared to a new all-time high at $0.679 on June 9 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick. That was followed by a sharp pullback to the 20-day EMA ($0.41) on June 12.The strong rebound off the 20-day EMA shows the sentiment is positive and traders are aggressively buying on dips. The bulls will now try to push the price to the all-time high where they are likely to encounter stiff resistance from the bears.If the price turns down from the all-time high, the bears will make one more attempt to pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, it will suggest the start of a deeper correction.Alternatively, if buyers propel the price above the all-time high, the TFUEL/USDT pair could resume the uptrend, with the next target objective at $0.85 and then $1.The 4-hour chart shows the pair rebounded strongly off the $0.40 support, which suggests accumulation at lower levels. However, the relief rally is facing resistance just below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.57.This suggests that the bears have not given up yet and are selling on rallies. If the price dips below the 20-EMA, the bears will try to pull the price down to $0.40. If that happens, the pair may consolidate between these two levels for a few days.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will indicate the sentiment is positive and the bulls are not waiting for a deeper fall to buy. That will increase the possibility of a break above $0.57. The pair could then rise to retest the all-time high.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

532,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk said his electric-vehicle company will start accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments once there’s confirmation that miners are utilizing clean energy, offering a glimmer of hope that the FUD surrounding digital assets could soon subside. Musk responded to a Cointelegraph tweet about recent accusations from Sygnia CEO Magda Wierzycka, who called on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the billionaire for allegedly manipulating Bitcoin’s price.This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.

When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.According to Wierzycka, Musk knowingly pumped the price of Bitcoin only to sell a “big part of his exposure at the peak.”“This is inaccurate,” Musk said in a Sunday response. “Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving [the] market.”As Cointelegraph reported, Musk acknowledged in April that Tesla had sold a portion of its Bitcoin holdings to prove the asset’s liquidity as an alternative to cash. Just one month earlier, the billionaire confirmed that Tesla had added $1.5 billion worth of BTC to its balance sheet and would begin accepting the digital asset as payment for its vehicles. However, Tesla’s embrace of Bitcoin-as-a-payment was short-lived after Musk flagged concerns over the cryptocurrency’s energy usage. On May 12, Musk tweeted that his company would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to the network’s “increasingly rapid use of fossil fuels...”Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhPMusk’s tweet coincided with a slew of negative headlines about Bitcoin’s energy usage, China’s intent to ban Bitcoin mining and an overextended crypto rally that was showing signs of weakness. The news cycle helped trigger one of Bitcoin’s most painful episodes, culminating in a 54% drop between mid-April and mid-May.Related: ‘I have not sold any of my Bitcoin’: Elon MuskOn Sunday, Musk laid the groundwork for when Tesla will once again accept Bitcoin payments:As Cointelegraph reported, Musk was recently invited to a meeting of Bitcoin miners by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor. The Bitcoin Mining Council, a voluntary, self-regulating industry body, emerged from the meeting with a mandate to exercise more renewable energy options and boost the transparency of cryptocurrency mining.Despite all the criticism about Bitcoin mining, it’s estimated that a strong majority of miners already use alternative energy sources. Yassine Elmandjra, an analyst with Ark Investments, told CNBC in April that roughly three-quarters of miners use carbon-free sources in their operations."
533,"It’s fun to talk about nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, because they are the perfect example of how the impact of blockchain technology in people’s lives goes way beyond the financial market. As we could see in hundreds of headlines in the past few months, they have gripped the world’s attention because they are a new manner of interacting with culture, music, sports and the media.This article will clarify what NFTs are, how they work, how the NFT boom started, and why blockchain technology has made it possible for NFTs to create a new economy.Related: A cure for copyright ills? NFTs promise to empower creative economiesNFTs are such an exciting and fun subject to talk about because almost everyone likes music, arts, games and the internet. The feeds of every social media platform are full of people who, having shown no prior interest in crypto assets or decentralized finance, eagerly talk about nonfungible tokens. In the first half of 2021, we saw a lot of celebrities and memes endorsing NFTs.Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, sold his first tweet as an NFT for the incredible amount of over $2.9 million this past March. Edward Snowden’s NFT, a portrait of Snowden himself, was sold for about $5.4 million, or 2,224 Ether (ETH).The NFT of the Zoë Roth meme, better known as “Disaster Girl” due to the 2005 (and beyond) meme of her malicious smile looking at the camera while a house is on fire in the background, was sold as an NFT for 180 ETH, equivalent to almost $500,000.Related: When dollars meet the hype: The biggest NFT hits from celebritiesFurthermore, companies from the traditional market have decided to surf the NFT wave. For example, in Brazil, the first collection in NFT of Havaianas was auctioned off last month.NFT transaction volume has multiplied by more than 25 since December 2020, as NFTs are in people’s daily routines and lives. It could be one of your favorite songs, a cartoon of your favorite superhero or a tool in a game that your children wish to acquire. In the following chart, we can clearly see the increase of NFT transactions in the last six months, as well as business volume since the end of the third quarter before the recent pop.We can conceptualize an NFT as a piece of software code that verifies the property of a nonfungible digital asset, or the digital representation of the physical nonfungible asset in a digital medium. For those who prefer a more technical view:In this case, any nonfungible asset may be the object of an NFT, be it domain names, tickets for an event, digital coins in games, and even identifiers in social networks like Twitter or Facebook. All those nonfungible digital assets could be NFTs.An NFT has a data structure (token) that links metadata files that may be fixed in an image or file. That token is carried and modified to accommodate the requirements of blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Kusama and Flow, among others. The art file is uploaded in a blockchain network that creates a metadata file in the data structure of the token.As a content creator, such as the digital artist Beeple or the rock band Kings of Leon, you upload your art file to a platform that takes your file’s metadata and passes it through the whole back-end process of a product, otherwise known as your NFT.Your NFT then gains a cryptographic hash (a key) — a tamper-proof register with the date and time stamp carried on the blockchain network. Following the valuable data and seeing that it had not been modified at a later date is essential for any artists out there.Loading your art on-chain may give you a better perspective of when the metadata of the art file was tokenized. Since the data of the piece of art is uploaded, nobody can retrieve it or delete it, and the chance of your artwork disappearing is practically nonexistent if your NFT is registered on a blockchain.Up until 2008, traditional NFTs did not have a unified representation in the digital world. As a result, they were not standardized, and the NFT markets closed and were limited to the platforms that issued and created a determinate NFT.The first NFTs in blockchains started with the advent of colored coins on Bitcoin’s blockchain. Although originally designed to enable Bitcoin (BTC) transactions, their script language stores small amounts of metadata on the blockchain, which can be used to represent asset management instructions.On the other hand, the first NFT experiment based on the Ethereum blockchain was CryptoPunks built by Larva Labs, which consisted of 10,000 collectible, “unique” punks. The fact that the punks “live” on the Ethereum network made them interoperable with digital markets and wallets.NFTs reached the mainstream on the Ethereum blockchain in 2017 with CryptoKitties, allowing users to create digital cats and reproduce them with varying pedigrees. This was a pioneer project for creating a sophisticated system of incentives, determining that NFTs could be used as a promotional tool. This led to the fostered interest of auction contracts, which lately have become one of the primary mechanisms for pricing and buying NFTs.Related: Art reimagined: NFTs are changing the collectibles marketThe exciting part about applying blockchain technology to NFTs is that it has considerably amplified their advantages and possibilities. It has brought forth the standardization of digital, nonfungible asset representation through the ERC-721 standard. Similar to the ERC-115 and the ERC-998 standards, ERC-721 is a pattern of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that brings a standardized way of verifying who owns an NFT, and a standardized way of “moving” nonfungible digital assets.It’s worth mentioning that although Ethereum is where most of the action currently happens, there are several NFT patterns emerging on other blockchains. For example, dGoods created by Mythical Games focuses on implementing a cross-chain standard using the EOS blockchain. Also, TRON’s first NFT standard, TRC-721, was officially announced in late December 2020. The introduction of this standard is expected to help the Chinese-centric blockchain utilize various distributed ledger technology-based apps and keep up with the pace of Ethereum’s growing NFT sector.Since then, an NFT registered on a blockchain has truly become a “unique” asset that cannot be faked, tampered with or spoofed.Related: Experts debate whether NFTs really need blockchainAs explained above, the first benefit of NFTs backed by blockchain technology is standardization. Besides the standardization of the primary attributes of NFTs — such as property, transfer and access control — blockchain technology allows NFTs to incorporate additional features, like specifications on how to acquire an NFT, for example. Other benefits include interoperability, marketability, liquidity, immutability, proven scarcity and programmability. We will explain each one by one.The NFT patterns make interoperability feasible so that the NFTs can move more easily among several ecosystems. In a new project, nonfungible tokens may be visualized immediately in dozens of different wallet providers, negotiable in several markets and with the ability to be acquired in several virtual worlds. That interoperability is only possible because of the open patterns allowed by blockchain technology that provide a clear, consistent, reliable application programming interface, and with the authorization to read and record data.Interoperability, in turn, has amplified the marketability of NFTs by enabling free trade in open markets. NFTs based on blockchains allow users to move their nonfungible assets outside of their original environments. They also have the advantage of sophisticated negotiation resources, such as auctions and bids, as well as the ability to transact in any currency, from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether to stablecoins and specific digital currencies from a determined application.The instant marketability of NFTs based on blockchains brings greater liquidity to markets that can serve a greater variety of public, enabling significant exposure of nonfungible assets to a broader group of buyers.The fifth and sixth advantages of the use of blockchain technology in NFTs are immutability and proven scarcity. This is because the smart contracts allow developers to set severe limits on an NFT’s supply and impose long-lasting properties that cannot be modified after a token has been issued. Therefore, one can guarantee that the specific properties of an NFT will not change with time, as they are codified in the blockchain. This is especially interesting for the physical art market that depends on the proven scarcity of an original piece.An interesting trajectory in this new NFT world based on blockchain appeared because of recent trends and new markets, such as programmable art — which allows collectors to interfere in the original design of the art piece.In the market of NFT-represented art, immutability and scarcity are essential. In the digital art market, the advantage of programmability could be something to consider. We can find examples of programmability at Async Art, a platform to negotiate and create NFTs that enables the owners to change their images whenever they wish. Another example of the programmability feature is the ability for a song to change its composition. That means that the music may sound different each time you listen to it. These two examples are possible by dividing a piece into separate layers called stems. Each stem has several variants for its new owner to choose from. That way, a single track of Async Music could contain many exclusive combinations of sounds.Many people have yet to understand the dimension of the NFT boom and how blockchain is revolutionizing the way we consume the arts. Perhaps the subject deserves a more thorough conversation.However, the hole-in-one of NFTs is the programmability of smart contracts on the blockchain, which always guarantees a reward to the content creator whenever their work is negotiated.Suppose a determined content (music, art, domain name, photograph of a goal from Pelé, etc.) is transacted hundreds of times. In that case, the content creator is going to receive a commission.This could completely change the dynamics of copyright and intellectual property because if a “division of income” is programmed into the NTF’s smart contract’s code, the content creators will no longer need to worry about the legal property of their artwork.Indeed, nonfungible tokens and blockchain technology markets still need to embark on a long journey to solve scalability, marketing infrastructure and the applicable jurisdiction in NFTs with decentralized storage. Nevertheless, we shall not lose sight of the possibility to codify the rights of the determined digital asset behind the transaction of an NFT. This enables the appearance of new businesses and new markets governed not only by institutions or traditional validators of trust but by those who create the content appreciated in the social and productive hubs.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
534,"From QR code payments to mobile banking apps, consumers worldwide are increasingly reliant on digital payment solutions, especially as mobile technology becomes more ubiquitous. Government-led efforts in driving cashless economies have been a key factor, with countries such as Singapore or the Philippines seeing their central banks driving the adoption of contactless payments during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, usage rates for digital payments platforms have recorded promising growth, even as high as 5,000% in the Philippines alone.Related: Digitized Europe: The shift to a cashless worldThis unprecedented rise in cashless payments is also paving the way for the broader adoption of crypto, with the number of crypto users worldwide hitting around 106 million in January. While this marks an impressive 15% month-on-month growth, it is still just a drop in the ocean when compared to the 4.7 billion people who have access to the internet.But as crypto continues to command headlines, what will it take for mass adoption to happen?Today, billions of people worldwide are unable to access even the most basic financial services via traditional means, and thus are unable to save or manage their money securely. In times of economic devastation, such as this past year in which global economies have been staggered by the impact of COVID-19, the vast gap between rich and poor has become abundantly clear. The global pandemic has only perpetuated the absence of inclusive financial infrastructure, which has led to approximately one-third of the global population having no financial safety net to fall back on.With crypto wallets, however, anyone can transfer their crypto internationally without needing to maintain a minimum balance in their account, as long as they have an internet connection. As crypto applications are built on decentralised blockchains, transactions are performed on a peer-to-peer basis in the absence of traditional intermediaries such as bankers or brokerage houses. This results in significant savings in transaction costs, as traditional cross-border remittance fees for small amounts can be as high as 7% after taking into account intermediaries’ fees on both the sender and recipient side. Meanwhile, the same fees for cryptocurrencies are often less than 1 percent — regardless of transaction amount.Related: Understanding the systemic shift from digitization to tokenization of financial servicesFurthermore, highly decentralised platforms are permissionless, meaning that anyone with a crypto wallet and internet connection can lend, remit or trade their crypto without validation by a central authority or intermediary. Instead, transactions are executed by smart contracts, which automate them as long as pre-encoded conditions are met. Beyond the cost savings, consider the time savings as well. Remittance transactions can take several days to be processed, whereas cryptocurrencies can be transferred in mere minutes.However, most crypto platforms still ask for some form of formal identification as part of their identity verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This can range from a phone number to photo ID to proof of residential address. Some platforms adopt a multi-tier approach in which the more information that users provide, the more services they can access. While necessary for KYC and Anti-Money Laundering compliance, this poses barriers to users who do not own any formal identification documents.Having said that, some decentralised exchanges, or DEXs, still honour the principles of anonymity and trustless working by not enforcing KYC on their users. The elimination of account verification and waiting time for approval has drawn many towards these types of DEXs — such as PancakeSwap, Uniswap and DeFiChain’s DEX — and has made finance truly accessible and inclusive for all.Beyond simple transactions, recent innovations in the crypto space promise a much more equitable financial system where the unbanked and underbanked can access more means to build wealth. While DeFi products, such as token holding and staking on a DEX, might be a little too advanced for this group of users at the moment, simplified centralized decentralized finance (CeDeFi) services and improvements in financial literacy over time will help to open the door to these inclusive wealth creation opportunities.Widespread adoption of digital payment technologies, such as QR codes and biometrics, is definitely a promising sign that consumers have become more digitally savvy than ever before. In the Asia Pacific, more than 90% of surveyed respondents said they would consider at least one new payment method in the next year.In addition to new payment technologies, the proliferation of retail investing has led to a paradigm shift in the investment landscape, with trading activities doubling over the past year. User-friendly platforms such as Robinhood and their well-known crypto counterparts — such as Coinbase — have made investing much more accessible to non-institutional investors.Related: Mass adoption of blockchain tech is possible, and education is the keyThis historic rise in cashless payments and retail investing saw the public gain more exposure to different asset types. However, in the United States, a staggering 84% of adults are either uninterested in cryptocurrencies or have never heard of them. While this could be attributable to the seemingly intimidating technicalities involved, we are now in a good place to gradually transition towards a more crypto-forward society.For now, there’s much more to be done to help mainstream consumers gain a better understanding of crypto. Crypto projects, for one, would do well to invest more resources towards creating educational content to bridge the knowledge gap — whether through guides or detailed explainers. Meanwhile, taking on a more transparency-focused approach that looks to debunk misconceptions and ensure that users are aware of the risks associated with crypto, will enable those users to navigate their entry into the space with greater ease and confidence.As conversations on cryptocurrencies evolve, governments are taking note. While cash will not be eliminated any time soon, as many as 86% of central banks around the world are looking into central bank digital currencies in their quest to go cashless. The world’s first central bank digital currency (CBDC) — the Sand Dollar — was announced by the Central Bank of the Bahamas way back in 2018 and officially launched in October last year. The technology team behind this project was led by U-Zyn Chua, who went on to co-found DeFiChain.Related: Did CBDCs affect the crypto space in 2020, and what’s next in 2021? Experts answerAlthough CBDCs will be regulated by a central authority, their adoption will send a profound message to market participants on the legitimacy of digital currencies. The introduction of CBDCs is thus a much-needed springboard to catalyse large-scale crypto adoption.In the short term, crypto is not going to replace the existing financial system, but will instead carve out its own ecosystem that is fit for a new generation of digital-first, financially savvy users. While it will take some time for consumers to warm up to crypto, the nascent technology will prove its worth in due time by offering cheaper, safer and more inclusive financial services for all.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

535,"Bitcoin (BTC) is still below a key moving average, and that is “not a bullish sign,” says a new report, but signs of a rebound have finally arrived.In its latest market update released on Friday, trading suite Decentrader highlighted three on-chain indicators calling for an imminent bullish continuation for BTC/USD.Bitcoin has now spent almost a month below its 200-day moving average (DMA). This is concerning, Decentrader warns, and external factors such as geopolitical sentiment continues to weigh on sentiment.“Bitcoin has kept the market on its toes as it continues to range between weekly support at $32,000 and near term resistance of the 200DMA currently at $42,000,” the update summarized.Bitcoin continued to range over the weekend, at the time of writing trading near $36,000 amid few signs of quashing resistance closer to $40,000.Fortunately, however, several measures of on-chain strength now suggest that the bounce from a bearish phase within an overall bull market is now underway.These are well-known — active addresses, sentiment, spent output profit ratio (SOPR) and stock-to-flow deviation. The two latter have been extensively covered by Cointelegraph.Active addresses, meanwhile, measures whether Bitcoin is overbought or oversold at a certain price point relative to the number of active addresses on the blockchain.Like SOPR, the indicator is currently in the same position as just after the bear market floor in December 2018 and the crash of March 2020. As such, if history repeats itself, the only way is up.“We received the same signal yesterday, suggesting that $BTC price was oversold relative to active addresses on-chain and could now be ready to bounce back over the coming weeks,” the update explained.Also on the cards is a rally back to the stock-to-flow trajectory line, something that its creator, PlanB, said would pose a “surprise” were it not to happen.Related: BTC price doesn’t care about El Salvador? 5 things to watch in Bitcoin this weekAmid hopes that BTC/USD will still hit $100,000 this year, Decentrader predicts that it may only be a matter of months before Bitcoin is back on track.“While we may not rally so hard and fast this time, fundamentally nothing has changed with how Bitcoin works, nothing is broken, we are just experiencing a lot of bad media coverage after a strong rally at the start of the year,” the company concluded."
536,"Decentralized finance came to life with the inception of Ethereum in 2013. However, it truly hit the ground running in 2016–2017 with the backing of Ethereum developers and some entrepreneurs and experts in the financial investment sphere. To get our facts right and clear all misconceptions, DeFi encapsulates a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain that are geared toward removing intermediaries between parties in financial transactions. Related: The great unbanking: How DeFi is completing the job Bitcoin startedA large majority of DeFi applications are built on top of Ethereum. The first major, and the largest, DeFi application is MakerDAO, which was founded by Rune Christensen. Ethereum, to put it briefly, is an open-source platform that uses blockchain technology to create and run decentralized digital applications.As an exciting new concept, DeFi is the rapidly expanding ecosystem of blockchain-based financial products that look to replicate or expand on the capabilities of traditional finance institutions — like banks, payment processors, clearinghouses and more. DeFi is portrayed to be a solution to the problems faced by traditional banking and financial institutions and shows how it may eventually replace the old system, in real time. Regardless of the technology or platform used, DeFi systems are designed to do away with intermediaries between transacting parties.The volume of trading tokens and money locked in smart contracts in its ecosystem has been growing exponentially, proving that this concept is here to stay. As per DeBank, there is approximately $60.5 billion in net value currently locked in DeFi.DeFi provides an accessible approach to manage financial transactions. As the name suggests, government jurisdictions and changes by centralized financial institutions do not apply to it. This eliminates the dependency on third parties, giving users complete control over their transactions and at the same time allowing them to remain anonymous since all transactions are carried out over smart contracts on the blockchain. Transactions and trading of cryptocurrencies can be executed from any location since it provides financial inclusivity.While there are no clear regulatory guidelines on DeFi-related topics, there are a few countries where certain isolated cases are taken into consideration by the country’s governing bodies. Although DeFi may hold great promise, it also raises novel policy and regulatory considerations.Related: FATF draft guidance targets DeFi with complianceThe United States’ financial regulation assumes the presence of intermediaries, and it applies regulation to intermediaries as a way to regulate financial markets and related activities comprehensively. As a result, regulators and policymakers may find that DeFi can lead them into uncharted, yet-to-be-tested territory.The decentralized finance sector has seen skyrocketing growth over the years. The ethos of the crypto and DeFi function is taking baby steps into conventional finance sectors vis-a-vis the saga involving GameStop and WallStreetBets.Related: GameStop saga reveals legacy finance is rigged, and DeFi is the answerAt some point, the question to be asked is not whether DeFi will become a major factor in the global economy but rather how creatively it will be developed and to what extent it will emerge as a force for broad benefit.One of the keys to guiding DeFi in a beneficial direction will be integrating advanced decentralized artificial intelligence. So far, few DeFi projects have leveraged AI, but we may well see AI woven into the next burst of DeFi activity later in 2021 — and maybe even in a way that enables DeFi to push startup decentralized technical projects forward with much more velocity and purpose.There are no two ways about DeFi emerging as an important player in the financial firmament today. It is not about new toys for speculators to play with nor the provision of more sophisticated financial tools for those who prefer to keep their wealth outside the control of centralized authorities. DeFi has the potential to be much more than this, but the key to achieve truly profound influence will be the extension of DeFi beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to the broader scope of lower-liquidity cryptocurrencies.Since 2020, DeFi has spawned a vast network of platforms and protocols that allow users to swap, trade, deposit, borrow and lend cryptocurrency for income and growth opportunities. This sort of cascading activity in the space has not been seen in traditional finance markets for decades.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

537,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) succession of sharp corrections from its all-time high at $64,900 has turned investor sentiment negative, at least for the short-term. While some analysts believe the bottom may have been hit, others are warning of a further fall due to the “Death Cross” pattern that, at the time of writing, is on the verge of completion. For new traders, the name death cross itself brings a lot of negativity and a feeling of impending doom. This sentiment can trigger selling panics, especially if the market has already been going through a bear phase prior to the pattern being spotted.However, is a death cross something to be feared or is it a crystal ball that gives traders insight on when a plunge is imminent?Let’s find out with the help of a few examples.The death cross forms when a faster period moving average, usually the 50-day simple moving average, crosses below the longer-term moving average, generally the 200-day SMA.The crossover is bearish as it shows that the uptrend has reversed direction. Large institutional investors generally do not buy in a falling market until a bottom is confirmed. Due to this, buying dries up and investors holding positions rush to the exit due to panic, exacerbating the decline.Before looking at a few death cross examples in the crypto markets, let’s see how the pattern has affected the S&P 500 index between 1929 to 2019. According to Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC, the average fall after the formation of the death cross is 12.57% and the median fall is much lesser at 7.75%.However, if only the post-1950 period is considered, the average fall is less than 10.37% and the median is at 5.38%.While those figures are not startling, especially for volatility-accustomed crypto traders, the bearish convergence of these two moving averages should not be taken lightly.History shows that the death cross has resulted in a few instances of massive declines in the U.S. stock market indices.After the death cross on June 19, 1930, the S&P 500 plummeted 78.84% before bottoming out on Sep. 15, 1932. The next terrible death cross came with a 53.44% correction that occurred from Dec. 19, 2007, to June 17, 2009.This shows how in select instances, the death cross has been able to predict a sharp correction. However, two sharp declines of over 50% in a 90-year history suggests the pattern is not reliable enough to instil instant fear in traders.As cryptocurrencies are still a nascent market, the available data is limited. Let’s review a few instances of the death cross and how it has affected Bitcoin.The most recent death cross occurred on March 26, 2020, when the BTC/USD pair closed at $6,758.18. However, this death cross turned out to be an excellent contrarian buy signal as the pair had already formed a bottom 2 weeks back at $3,858 on March 13.Before that, the pair had formed a death cross on Oct. 26, 2019, when the price closed at $9,259.78. By then, the pair had already corrected 33% from the high at $13,868.44 made on June 26, 2019.After the cross, the pair bottomed out at $6,430 on Dec. 18, 2019, suffering a further 30% fall. From the high of $13,868.44 to the low at $6,430, the total decline was roughly 53%.In another scenario, Bitcoin’s roaring bull market topped out at $19,891.99 on Dec. 17, 2017, and the death cross formed on March 30, 2018, when the pair closed at $6,848.01. By then, the pair had already corrected over 65% from the then all-time high.Thereafter, the selling continued and the bear market bottom formed at $3,128.89 on Dec. 15, 2018. This meant a further fall of about 54% from the death cross and a total drawdown of 84% from the all-time high.The above instances show how the death cross occurs late in the bear market cycle and investors who wait for the pattern to form give a lot of profits back to the market. At the same time, initiating bearish bets may work for short-term traders but could prove detrimental for long-term investors.The examples show how the death cross is a lagging pattern, which forms when a large part of the decline has already occurred. Typically, long-term investors don’t need to panic if they spot the death cross on the daily charts but it is a signal to be more attentive to and perhaps prepare one’s portfolio for positioning for a variety of unanticipated outcomes.Death crosses can also, at times, be used as a contrarian signal so when they are spotted traders should look for other indications of the chart to spot a possible bottom.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

538,"This year, stocks like the movie theater chain AMC Entertainment and video game retailer GameStop (GME) have been the vehicle for individual retail traders to show their dissent against the so-called “free market.” Starting in late January and driven by sentiment from Reddit communities such as r/Wallstreetbets, these meme stocks have seen enormous growth this year. GameStop has shown 1,069.80% year-to-date returns, while AMC has shown 1,919.34% gains. At this rate, they should have 2,440% and 4,378% returns on an annual basis, respectively.Around the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) ventured beyond the $50,000 mark for the first time ever following the now infamous GME short squeeze and Tesla’s purchase of BTC worth $1.5 billion. While BTC’s price momentum carried on to reach its all-time high of $64,889 on April 14, it crashed severely to reach its pre-surge levels of early January at around $35,000 at the time of writing.On June 1, the AMC stock began rallying yet again, more than doubling in value in a single day. The stock rose from nearly $30 to hit a high of $65.57 in the mid-day trading session on June 2. BTC also saw a small rebound from the sub-$35,000 levels on the same day to reach the $38,600 range on June 3. Since meme stocks and cryptocurrencies often trade purely on market sentiment and have seemingly correlated in the past in their upward movement, it’s important to assess the correlation between the two, if any at all.Martin Gaspar, research analyst at CrossTower — a digital assets exchange — told Cointelegraph, “There doesn’t seem to be a large correlation between GME/AMC stock price and Bitcoin price. In the short squeeze that we saw earlier this year, the rise of the price of both GameStop and BTC is likely to have been coincidental.”About the prospects of AMC in the near future, he added, “AMC could very well be the new GameStop. Stock forums and memes online are showing that many traders seem to believe in AMC, despite its soaring price relative to fundamentals.”Due to the recent meme frenzy for AMC, the company even got an upgrade in credit rating. According to analysts at S&P Global Ratings, the firm has a lower chance of defaulting after it leverages on the meme frenzy by raising cash in the equity markets. It sold 11.55 million shares at an average price of $50.85. Even though the company’s bonds are classified in the most speculative category of bonds, quite close to companies that are defaulting or at near defaulting, S&P upgraded its rating to CCC+, which is two tiers above its previous levels and seven tiers below investment grade — i.e., BBB-.Adding to the correlation aspect, Gaspar also commented, “We have also seen more recently that BTC’s price has languished, while AMC has soared, further underscoring this relationship.”The existence of the correlation between the GME/AMC stocks is often difficult to concretely prove due to the inherently volatile nature of the cryptocurrency markets. Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin — a cryptocurrency exchange — told Cointelegraph:AMC shares rose 95.22% on June 2 to hit $62.55. Following the announcement of the 11.55-million-share sale, the share price fell by 17.92%. This, combined with the fluctuations seen in GameStop earlier in the year, is proof that any scenario is possible with these stocks due to missing fundamentals and information spreading on Reddit.Although, Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money, has indicated that this might be the right time to get into GameStop and AMC, although he warned that “if you’ve ridden them up from much lower levels, take a little off the table. These stories could always get dinged.”Do Kwon, co-founder of Terra — a protocol for fiat pegged stablecoins — elaborated on the relationship between Reddit and these stocks, telling Cointelegraph, “Both [GME and AMC] reflect the retail trader’s dismay with the current HFT [high-frequency trading] incumbents and asymmetries of the TradFi world.” He added further, “It wouldn’t be surprising to see this continually happen to other assets in the future, especially as social media and the way people organize and interact online evolve.”Speaking of stocks with well-established correlations with Bitcoin, MicroStrategy (MSTR) is the first stock that comes to mind due to the large Bitcoin reserves it holds, along with the high bullish stance of its CEO and founder, Michael Saylor. The company holds 92,079 BTC valued at over $3.4 billion, accounting for 0.43% of the token’s maximum supply of 21 million tokens.Related: Stocks of Bitcoin: JPMorgan offers BTC exposure, an ETF in sheep’s clothingThe firm was one of the first publicly traded companies that added Bitcoin to its balance sheet and was also considered a proxy of BTC by the investors in the traditional financial markets. Lyu further said, “The shares of companies that own Bitcoin depend on its value. MicroStrategy lost up to 10% during the week; Bitcoin lost the same amount. It’s okay when you have 90,000 BTC.”In fact, MicroStrategy is included in JPMorgan’s Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket (CEB), which is a debt instrument portfolio comprising 11 unevenly distributed stocks. These stocks are either issued by the companies that hold BTC on their books as a treasury asset or related to the cryptocurrency in an auxiliary manner.Apart from MicroStrategy that has 20% of the total allocation, the CEB also has stocks of the companies Square, PayPal, Nvidia Corporation, Riot Blockchain, Advanced Micro Devices, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd, Intercontinental Exchange, CME Group, Overstock.com and Silvergate Capital Corporation. Gaspar further spoke on the performance of the CEB in comparison to BTC:Regarding the impact of the meme stock phenomenon on the flagship cryptocurrency in BTC, it remains unclear due to some of the movements looking to be seemingly coincidental. However, it could be a precursor for another meme coin rally similar to the performance of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) earlier this May as Gaspar stated, “There is speculation among traders that meme coins could be positioned to rally once the crypto market regains its footing.”What’s important is that the communities that drove the meme stocks to such levels are also behind the stock surges for GameStop and AMC. According to Kwon, “What’s interesting is that the fundamentals for GameStop, AMC and DOGE are all subpar within their relative markets, but they represent a new kind of social Schelling point that is a manifestation of investor dismay with current limits in the current system.”Related: All hail the Shiba? Rise of Dogecoin pretenders fueled by meme frenzyHowever, a meme coin supported by a motivated and decentralized community of online proponents grows out of being a meme after a certain point, as seen in the case of Dogecoin.It is highly likely that once these meme stocks are saturated with demand, some part of this demand has a high chance of flowing into altcoins, more specifically, meme coins. Especially through trading platforms like Robinhood, retail traders crowd the site looking to make a quick buck and have a laugh with their friends while doing so. "
539,"Bitcoin (BTC) can still hit an average price of $288,000 in the next three years, confident analyst PlanB has said after BTC/USD shed 7% on June 12.In a tweet on Saturday, the creator of the popular stock-to-flow Bitcoin price models cast aside doubts over the Bitcoin bull run continuing.Alongside a chart describing Bitcoin as ""going for gold,"" PlanB was characteristically cool about Bitcoin's recent progress despite a failure to break out above $40,000.As Cointelegraph reported, concerns from traders and external sources alike have been mounting over the past week, these centering on a possible deeper BTC price correction.""$288K still in play,"" PlanB retorted.Such ""surprise"" would provide a serious test for the model, which has so far charted Bitcoin's growth with unique precision.The $288,000 price tag refers to an average value called for by the Stock-to-Flow Cross-Asset (S2FX) iteration, while a previous version requires a more modest $100,000 average. Both are based on the current halving cycle, a four-year period between block subsidy halvings due to end in April 2024.Earlier, Cointelegraph noted that spot price deviation from S2F readings has reached levels which normally see a rebound and a new all-time high.In additional comments, PlanB noted that 2021 really did fit with behavior from other all-time high years — 2013 and 2017 — further quashing suggestions that Bitcoin is facing serious problems.""Deviation is not much different from 2013 (S2F ~10) or 2017 (S2F ~25), just the usual inertia after a halving,"" he told Twitter users.Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, has added to the upbeat mood over the power of the halvings.Related: Bitcoin price gains 6% as Bloomberg analyst favors $40K over $20K nextOn Saturday, he described Bitcoin's declining supply as a ""bullish ace"" for the largest cryptocurrency which can naturally boost price.""Bitcoin $100,000 Has Bullish Ace Up Its Sleeve: Declining Supply — This year follows a cut in Bitcoin supply, making the price more likely to appreciate if past patterns hold,"" he summarized.His bullishness comes as Taproot, described as the most important Bitcoin network upgrade in four years, is locked in for activation by nodes.Due in November, Taproot provides a host of improvements which will, among other things, make it cheaper to use some key features such as multisignature transactions. "
540,"This is Part Four of a multipart series that aims to answer the following question: What is the “fundamental value” of Bitcoin? Part One is about the value of scarcity, Part Two — the market moves in bubbles, Part Three — the rate of adoption, and Part Four — the hash rate and the estimated price of Bitcoin.In data mining, the term “hash rate” is a security metric. The greater the hashing power, the greater its safety and resistance to external attacks. It’s one thing for a hacker to attack your home computer, but it’s another when a hacker tries to attack tens of thousands of computers around the world at the same time.The hash rate growth is due to the ever-increasing computing power of mining servers, which also means increasing costs to mine Bitcoin (BTC). A simple rule tells us that a given activity must have economic convenience in order for it to be sustainable over time. Those who extract oil from the ground must sell it at a cost greater than the cost of extraction, those who produce electricity must sell it at a cost greater than the cost of production, and so on.The same rule applies to Bitcoin mining, whereby the cost of electricity, the amortization of increasingly powerful servers, etc., must be lower than the revenues generated by receiving Bitcoin for the activity carried out.Related: Is Bitcoin a waste of energy? Pros and cons of Bitcoin miningTherefore, the growing difficulty of mining Bitcoin must be matched by economic convenience.In the first months of 2010, Bitcoin paid miners about $10,000 per month. Today, thanks to the growth in the price of Bitcoin, the network of miners in the world are distributed a wealth of over $500 million per month — and this value is destined to grow.The figure is enormous, even if partially commensurate with the consumption of electricity, but it allows us to understand the generation of wealth that this “social experiment” is able to create. As we can see from the graph, the growth of the hash rate is higher than the growth of monthly remuneration. Therefore, in order to estimate the correct price of Bitcoin based on hash rate, it is first necessary to understand the trend of remuneration for each unit of hash over time.As we can see, the dollar remuneration of the hash rate is in sharp decline. This means that security increases almost exponentially over time, but the cost of security drops considerably over that time.For a better understanding, while the remuneration for each block grows — despite or thanks to the halving that increases scarcity — the difficulty of undermining a new block increases much more quickly, at least for now. Therefore, the price/hash rate ratio goes down because the denominator goes up more substantially than the numerator.So, to estimate the (non-linear) trend of decline in remuneration for hash rate, the function that best represents this trend is, as always, the power law function, as shown in the following figure.Once we obtain this function by multiplying the two functions of hash rate growth and payment by a single hash rate, it is possible to obtain the function that approximates the monthly remuneration in U.S. dollars over time.This result does not approximate the value of the price of a single Bitcoin but of the monthly remuneration that is growing over time, as can be seen on the previous graph.To estimate the Bitcoin price, corrected according to this hash rate metric, it is necessary to divide this value by the average number of Bitcoin that is mined in a given month. By doing so, we obtain the typical stepped trend of the stock-to-flow model described earlier.We can conclude that even in the face of strong volatility and apparently incomprehensible price movements, the principal three factors that move the price of Bitcoin — the scarcity, the demand and the cost of production — can be really useful to understand the dynamics of Bitcoin price movements.We can argue that there are long-term fundamental value trends that can help to consider Bitcoin a “strategic asset class” of investment.This article was co-authored by Ruggero Bertelli and Daniele Bernardi.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

541,"The Taproot upgrade has achieved the first significant milestone on the road to activation as 90% of the Bitcoin (BTC) mining hash rate signaled for the protocol improvement within the current difficulty epoch.Data from Taproot.watch, a webpage created by Bitcoin developer Hampus Sjöberg, shows the lock-in stage is now completed.All recognized mining pools signaled for the upgrade with Slush Pool being the first to do so. It is perhaps fitting that Slush Pool also mined block 687285 that sealed the Taproot lock-in.TAPROOT LOCKED IN AT BLOCK 687285 BY SLUSHPOOL pic.twitter.com/FFDdibtmGtAntPool and F2Pool — the top two Bitcoin mining pools by hash rate share — were also among one of the earliest supporters of the Taproot activation in the BTC mining arenaIn a conversation with Cointelegraph Bitcoin core developer Pieter Wuille explained the activation step for Taproot, stating: “According to BIP341, once locked in, activation is automatic at block height 709632 - expected around November 14, 2021.”Wuille also commented on the significance of Taproot, adding:According to Wuille, the activation in November is only the beginning as the real work will be building the software to leverage the benefits of the protocol improvement.June 12’s historic significance for Bitcoin has also moved beyond Taproot as the day seen a record number of transactions mined in a single block. Data from blockchain explorer Blockchair shows 4,075 transactions in block height 687249.This record figure is almost twice the average transactions per block recorded on June 11 and is four times the typical transaction count for Bitcoin blocks.With hash rate declining amid mining restrictions in China, Saturday’s transaction count average might be due to a slowdown in block production forcing more transactions to be included in a single block."
542,"The cryptocurrency space and wider economic community continue to laud a historic move by El Salvador to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. The Central American country has become the first in the world to do so, and the move has also spurred a handful of other Central and South American countries to begin taking steps toward that same eventuality.Unsurprisingly, the move has made waves in the cryptocurrency community, with Bitcoin (BTC) proponents, in particular, highlighting the significance of the legislative change in driving cryptocurrency adoption. There have been some critics who have highlighted potential coercive undertones of the law, which has added intrigue to the situation, but the overarching response has been positive.Things have moved quickly in El Salvador following the announcement from the country’s president, Nayib Bukele — which took place during the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami — that the country’s congress would be voting on the new legislation. In the space of a few days, Bukele’s plans to make Bitcoin legal tender became reality as the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly voted in favor of the new law on June 9.The country’s president took things one step further when he tasked state-owned electricity producer LaGeo to begin exploring the possibility of powering Bitcoin mining using the country’s rich geothermal energy. No less than a day later, a new geothermal well had been drilled that Bukele said would power a Bitcoin mining facility in the near future.Our engineers just informed me that they dug a new well, that will provide approximately 95MW of 100% clean, 0 emissions geothermal energy from our volcanos

Starting to design a full #Bitcoin mining hub around it.

What you see coming out of the well is pure water vapor pic.twitter.com/SVph4BEW1LThe move was even immortalized on the Bitcoin blockchain by mining firm Poolin, which included a Salvadoran newspaper headline reading “asamblea aprueba la ley bitcoin,” translating to “assembly approves the Bitcoin law,” into block 686,938 mined earlier this week. This is reminiscent of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto including a Times newspaper headline reading “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” in the Bitcoin genesis block over a decade ago.Bukele has also pledged to help Bitcoin users emigrate to El Salvador while touting the benefits of BTC no longer being subject to capital gains tax. As things move at breakneck speed in El Salvador, it’s worth taking a look at the wider reactions from the cryptocurrency community and the reverberations of the newly passed legislation.El Salvador’s congress voted to pass President Bukele’s “Bitcoin Law,” which recognizes Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar, with 62 of a total 84 votes in agreement with the new legislation.The law will allow citizens to pay for goods and services in Bitcoin, and Bukele also stated that the Salvadoran government will guarantee the convertibility of Bitcoin into dollars at the time of any given transaction.This is made possible by a $150-million trust established by El Salvador’s Bandesal development bank. In essence, the government will buy BTC from locals if they wish to receive dollars instead of BTC.A point of contention is Article 7 of the legislation, which requires vendors or businesses to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment from customers, as it is now legal tender. Monetary economist and historian George Selgin raised important concerns over Articles 7 and 13 in a thread on Twitter, suggesting that they are coercive, in that they will force all Salvadoran merchants and companies to accept BTC as a means of payment.Article 7 reads: “Every economic agent must accept bitcoin as payment when offered to him by whoever acquires a good or service.” Article 13 states: “All obligations in money expressed in USD, existing before the effective date of this law, may be paid in bitcoin.”The renowned economist stated that the move was a “win for Bitcoin,” but he questioned whether it was a “win for freedom,” given that these articles will force Salvadoran businesses and vendors to accept BTC whether they want to or not. Selgin argued that Articles 7 and 13, which “qualify as ‘legal tender’ provisions,” essentially “undermine free choice in currency instead of promoting it.”The economist called for cryptocurrency and Bitcoin proponents to rally against and condemn these specific clauses in the law. His critique was widely shared and provides a healthy dose of perspective to a situation that has received a lot of positive press.While Selgin’s arguments raise some poignant questions around El Salvador’s new currency law, there seems to have been widespread positive sentiment toward the country’s swift move to accept Bitcoin as legal tender.Many prominent cryptocurrency and Bitcoin advocates have heralded the move as an important step toward more widespread adoption and acceptance of the preeminent cryptocurrency as a store of value and a means of payment. Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Bitfinex, told Cointelegraph that he believes the move will serve as a major step in providing financial freedom:Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai — a company building artificial intelligence for blockchain — highlighted the significance of first-mover advantage and suggested that countries like El Salvador will attract companies and individuals working in the cryptocurrency space, adding: “A handful of countries adopting Bitcoin or even buying Bitcoin to use as wealth reserves will increase their wealth and lend positive momentum to cryptocurrency adoption.”Jeffrey Wang, head of Americas at Amber Group, echoed Sheikh’s sentiments in his correspondence with Cointelegraph, highlighting favorable regulatory moves as a key way to attract cryptocurrency- and blockchain-focused businesses: “The biggest cloud that hangs over the crypto industry is the uncertainty of regulation, so moving quickly now to embrace it as a country can be a significant advantage to attract capital and talent to your country.”Wang also said that swift changes being made in the country could serve as a real-life test case for Bitcoin being adopted as legal tender, and there is the potential for it to be the catalyst for the country to become a hub for cryptocurrency businesses to thrive:Ardoino also highlighted the role that cryptocurrencies could play in helping Central and South American countries grapple with long-term economic problems that have plagued their currencies and people: “Bitcoin has resonated for the benefits that it may bring to the tragedy we’ve witnessed in South American economies. The potential it has to bring financial freedom to the region shouldn’t be understated.”With the new Bitcoin Law passed in El Salvador, there is now keen interest in the short-term changes that will be felt in the country and beyond. Sebastian Ramirez, head of business operations at bitFlyer USA, told Cointelegraph that a large number of everyday individuals could become less skeptical about Bitcoin and start looking at it as a viable alternative to their existing solutions and see it as a better store of value.Ramirez also noted that the law change in El Salvador may remove some barriers to entry, like having to pay tax when using Bitcoin. He also conceded that the law change might not lead to an immediate shift in perception in the country and beyond:Wang conceded that there might be some teething problems, as vendors and businesses in the country still need to set up the necessary infrastructure to begin accepting BTC. Furthermore, people may be reluctant to spend their BTC on everyday purchases, given the cryptocurrency’s increased use as a store of value first and foremost: “I imagine for the majority, they hold BTC for the longer term potential price appreciation so spending it to buy bread today when it can double in a week will be too high an opportunity cost.”The speed at which El Salvador passed its historic Bitcoin Law has made it difficult for major financial and economic regulatory bodies to react or intervene. Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund raised some concerns around the move in a press conference on June 10.IMF spokesperson Gerry Rice stated that consultations will take place with the Salvadoran government. The IMF has been in talks with the country to provide over $1 billion in financing: “Adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues that require very careful analysis. So, we are following developments closely, and we’ll continue our consultations with the authorities.”Some in the global community have also posed questions around the timing of Bukele’s move to swiftly adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar, which has served as the Central American country’s reserve currency since 2001.Ramirez gave his opinion on the timing of the move: “The main reason here is the race to become a Bitcoin hub in Latin America.” He added, “This announcement is putting El Salvador on the map and attracting a lot of foreign interest, which applies pressure on other Latin American countries who don’t want to be left behind.”Related: Death knell for Chinese crypto miners? Rigs on the move after gov’t crackdownSheikh believes that “As a PR move, the timing was probably set to accommodate the Bitcoin Miami conference.” He further suggested that timing could also factor in ongoing developments in China, where the government is beginning to take a harder line toward Bitcoin mining operators:Nevertheless, all eyes are now on El Salvador and Central America. The country is laying the foundation for the adoption and widespread use of Bitcoin as means of payment and has promised to build essential infrastructure to facilitate large Bitcoin mining operations powered by clean geothermal energy."
543,"Cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly mainstream. Between the entrance en masse of traditional financial institutions — from investment funds, to banks, to insurance companies — to the multitrillion-dollar market capitalization, crypto is truly unignorable. As such, it is also increasingly on the radar of regulators around the world, particularly in the United States. How can this industry balance stability and investor protection on the one hand with the promotion and support of innovation on the other?There are three paths to regulating crypto. The first is to not regulate it as much, but given the incredible growth and increasing overlap with traditional financial markets, it is unlikely that regulators will find that path tenable.Another option is to regulate the industry from on high, without deep engagement or consultation from good-faith companies in the crypto space. This way could be perilous and could sacrifice the powerful financial innovation of blockchain that could be harnessed for good.The third — and we believe the only truly viable option — is regulation that involves an ongoing partnership with the industry itself. Many in the crypto industry already see this sort of proactive, innovation-oriented regulation as something that will greatly advance the industry.Related: Blockchain will thrive once innovators and regulators work togetherBitcoin (BTC) was born over a decade ago as a peaceful protest against the expansive monetary policy of the great financial crisis of 2008. What started as a niche industry for cyberpunks, libertarians and, quite frankly, people wanting to buy weed more conveniently and anonymously has morphed into a concentration of mind power, with 46 million Americans owning Bitcoin. The sheer scale of crypto as an asset class, with a market capitalization peaking north of $2 trillion, puts it on the radar of every lawmaker and regulatory agency in the world. To expect crypto to march onward in the unsupervised manner of its early years is simply unrealistic. Mainstream asset classes cannot go unnoticed, and the influx of new investors needs protecting.Related: Europe awaits implementation of regulatory framework for crypto assetsAs entrepreneurs, our concern about regulation does nt stem from a desire to run amok. If history is any guide, too often the regulation on innovative businesses is imposed by legislators who are, quite understandably, not into the intricate details of industry-native processes and have little or no practical experience. This gap between innovators and regulators opened up decades ago with the massive expansion of internet-based companies, and has resulted time and again in unnecessarily burdensome rules that do little to serve their purported purpose. The alternative is of no benefit to advanced jurisdictions because nimble companies will usually seek offshore tax havens with little regulatory friction and lax rules, which ultimately hits state coffers, especially in post-COVID-19 remote-work-adjusted societies. The reality is: Legislation lags behind innovation, which occurs at a significant pace.The matter gets even more complicated when one considers the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. These solutions, colloquially referred to as “noncustodial” or “unhosted” — meaning there is not a centralized third-party intermediary, but the intermediary is the software itself — present challenges when it comes to putting them into existing rules, especially in financial intermediation and securities laws.Related: Authorities are looking to close the gap on unhosted walletsOur hypothesis is that the most productive legislation will come from regulators working with good-faith actors in the crypto space who wish to actively engage with them. What does that engagement look like? One part of it is taking proactive steps to work within the existing regulatory frameworks in order to better identify where gaps and friction remain.To take the example of DeFi above, while it presents new regulatory challenges, there are ways to ease this burden initially. Centralized finance (CeFi) companies can be the interim solution, serving as a bridge between the traditional financial sector and the regulatory framework that encapsulates them on one hand and the decentralized finance space on the other. These companies very well understand the sector from both the infrastructure point of view and the needs of their users.Until we reach the conclusion that the current regulatory framework does not apply for blockchain companies or the sector gets specific legislation, CeFi businesses have been on a license acquisition crusade, culminating in a significant number of licenses from regulators across the globe, with more pending authorizations in the pipeline. This means that they are perfectly placed to allow DeFi projects to piggyback on our infrastructure, as they are just starting to consider allocating funds to legal expenses and lobbyism.Also, they can rely on established Know Your Customer (KYC)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures prescribed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), as well as fiat on- and off-ramps to broaden their offering and bring it to their users in a manner that is compliant with the incumbent rules.Related: FATF draft guidance targets DeFi with complianceIf one part of being an engaged partner to regulators is seeking to work within existing frameworks first, another part is having a perspective on key areas of legitimate concern for regulators, so they can work with industry rather than against it to develop solutions.Crypto is volatile. Despite being in a downward trend, volatility is here to stay. As a disciple of Benoit Mandelbrot and a student of capital markets, let me tell you: Volatility tends to cluster — i.e., volatility begets more volatility. This is what attracts many people to the space — the promise of multiple X on their initial capital. Of course, volatility works both ways. Yes, Bitcoin can go up 15x in 12 months, but it can also undergo corrections of 30% in a matter of hours. Such rapid, severe corrections occur in every bull cycle. However, it just so happens that those corrections usually precede larger legs up, as the March 2020 crash showed.The more recent correction of May, while not as severe, was important because it showed the remarkable resilience of the DeFi space. There were cascades of liquidations, yet the protocols stood their ground (for the most part) and performed as designed even as Bitcoin slumped 35% and Ether (ETH) close to 40%, futures traded in severe backwardation, and implied volatility in the options market surpassed 250%. In my former life, I was a trader in equities futures, and I have vivid memories of the S&P 500 flash crash of May 6, 2010, where the indexes lost 10% within minutes, only to retrace those losses a short period after. It was anything but orderly as the most advanced, sophisticated, regulated and monitored markets experienced total mayhem. It took five months for the Securities and Exchange Commission and CFTC to gain a preliminary understanding of what actually happened.It is also worth noting that despite the May correction, Bitcoin is up 27.26% in 2021 and has surged 284.58% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has added 11.95% year to date and 34.63% over the past year. Gold is flat for the year and has gained 11% in the past 12 months. In short, much of the volatility concerns around Bitcoin have to do with one’s time scale — and moreover, the investment strategies one is using.Within this overall framework of volatility, there is one aspect worth discussing further: leverage.As the best-performing asset of the past decade, Bitcoin is unique in many aspects, and investing requires a certain mindset and the right time horizon. Day trading any asset — but even more so, cryptocurrencies — is a one-way ticket to obliterating your trading account. 100x, 135x and 500x leverage means you get liquidated when the underlying asset moves less than 1%, which in crypto might mean seconds. Here’s a great thread on volatility and cascades of liquidations. Spoiler alert: Although objective and informative, it comes from someone who profits enormously from excessive leverage.Bitcoin and other crypto assets are a great addition to any well-diversified portfolio and should be bought and holded for extensive periods of time during which, history has shown, Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset, except perhaps the U.S. dollar against the Zimbabwe dollar. Should you put your kid’' college funds in crypto after it has 15x-ed in 12 months? Probably not. And definitely not with any sort of leverage, as even 2x leverage can get you liquidated in a March 2020 sort of correction, which saw intraday prices dip more than 50%.Related: Risk management in crypto: Aka 'the art of not losing all your money'At our company, we have little tolerance for leverage and have been advising our extensive customer base to be cautious since at least January. A client depositing $100,000 worth of Bitcoin gets an instant crypto credit line of $50,000 with us. Compare that to a trading platform that allows traders to enter trades with 100x leverage. That means, in order to buy a position of $100,000 in BTC, the margin required is $1,000. The rest of the $99,000 is borrowed at rates that are lucrative for the lender. Additionally, exchanges and prop shops profile their clients — they are quick to identify those high-rollers engaging in 100x levered trades, then they gladly take the other side of the trade, as everything these clients deposit can instantly be booked as profit.In our opinion, leverage in the crypto space would be a reasonable place for regulators to look when analyzing who is focused on investor protection. The legitimate purpose of protecting investors in nascent industries is a difficult balancing act, as it sometimes borders on the stifling of innovation. But the reverse is true as well: “Innovation” cannot be used as an excuse for rapacious behavior because 100x leverage is not innovation. Forex got it pre-Satoshi, and no, it does not contribute to the betterment of society.Companies need to work with their respective national bodies to ensure the right type of investor protection legislation is implemented. This approach is far more constructive than the alternative: stubbornly insisting that the current regulatory framework is obsolete and doesn’t capture the cutting edge of crypto and fintech.On money laundering, most crypto industry participants have the same feeling: On one hand, we are happy to play by the rules. On the other, crypto has been unfairly maligned when the massively preferred currency of money laundering has been and remains the U.S. dollar.Any widely accepted currency is prone to money laundering, and the fact remains that the incumbent financial system and the U.S. dollar are the preferred means for illicit purposes. It is not just about the medium of exchange itself. Do the rewards of aiding the finance of illicit activities outweigh the repercussions? Just type in your search engine the name of a major bank plus money laundering and you will see how large the problem is. Then try to find out how many of the complaints were civil vs. criminal, and what percentage ended up with settlements with “no admission of guilt.” As long as a slap on the wrist and a few percentage points of the gains from abetting illicit activities remains the punishment, there is little to no hope that money laundering will suffer any significant blow.There is no data to support that Bitcoin plays a meaningful role in the transnational money laundering scene. Crypto is also far from being as anonymous as people may think. The fact that a system can be misused does not mean the system should be outlawed; otherwise, we would have long parted ways with banking, cash, fiat currencies, the internet and just about any manifestation of human ingenuity. Yet, we hear the concerns, and we are making sure that in the history books, they will be nothing more than temporary FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt.There is another important point on money laundering concerns. We use plenty of tools — such as the sophisticated algorithms of Chainalysis, CypherTrace and Coinfirm — to trace the origins of cryptocurrencies and show a detailed flow of funds. This allows us to draw definitive conclusions on the status of a particular crypto deposit and apply the risk-based AML approach of the FATF. Sure, there are obfuscation tools and cross-chain techniques that make tracking more difficult, but nothing more than what already exists in the banking sector — cross border transfer, offshore jurisdictions, etc.As someone who has a significant portion of their net worth derived from cryptocurrencies, let me say: Getting fiat currencies from the sale of crypto into the banking system is a Herculean task, so it is the furthest thing from a “money launderer’s dream.” Top tier-one banks require extensive proof of funds from early Bitcoin investors, including, but not limited to, the cryptographically signed messages of the earliest wallets. So, I am not sure how a darknet drug dealer would transfer crypto wealth into the U.S. dollar or euro in any meaningful amounts. Their best hope is to stay within crypto and pay for goods and services with crypto. Sounds similar to the method that the drug cartels have been using since before Pablo Escobar’s days.In the crypto markets, regulators have something truly unique. The cryptomarket is the only free market, where there is no central bank to engage in interventionist policies, to control interest rates and the money supply. There is no lender of last resort, which in traditional markets has created some moral hazard and has encouraged aggressive long positions. There is no Fed put, no Plunge Protection Team, no bailouts.In crypto, the market forces of supply and demand and of leveraging and deleveraging get to play out without an arbiter. While this can be dramatic at times, it adds to the antifragility of the space and makes it quick to adapt to new circumstances. While painful for novice investors who come in late to the party and usually with leverage, none of the corrections in crypto cost any government taxpayer money.This means that crypto cannot be a systemic risk and no company within it can ever be “too big to fail,” which is a net positive for the advancement of innovation. Unlike traditional finance, in crypto, it’s those that develop good products and services that survive.If crypto has been in a bubble in the past years — and it might very well be — equities have been in a bubbly state for the better part of the last decade. Tesla’s normalized price-to-earnings ratio is 676.35, and as Lyn Alden put it:But the bubble in crypto should be viewed as a byproduct of the aggressive monetary policy by the world’s central banks and fears of 1970s type inflation, so eloquently said by Paul Tudor Jones, the guy who put “hedge” in the term “hedge funds.”Related: Forecasting Bitcoin price using quantitative models, Part 2There is no doubt that the next Google, Amazon, Facebook or Apple will come out of the crypto space. But for the crypto market to sustain and surpass its current market capitalization of $2 trillion, it needs to continue its path to maturity.This is why as innovators, but also as licensed institutions, we welcome a constructive dialogue with all key stakeholders of the regulatory process that will ideally translate into clear rules around the way business ought to be structured. It is for the benefit of all involved — regulatory bodies, businesses and retail clients — to have clear guidance and regulatory certainty. This will lead to sustainability, innovation, security of funds, consumer protection, sound AML procedures, and ultimately, more revenue for the jurisdictions that decide to embrace crypto, echoing the United States’ embrace of the internet in the early 2000s.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

544,"Welcome to Cointelegraph Market’s weekly newsletter. This week we will identify emerging-sector trends across the cryptocurrency landscape in order to broaden your understanding of market cycles and better equip readers to take advantage of the microcycles that are a regular occurrence in the larger market structure.The cryptocurrency sector has an established reputation for being volatile and fast-moving, and these characteristics were on full display in May as the rapid decline in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) from $60,000 to $33,000 led to a mass exodus that wiped off $1.2 trillion in value from the total market capitalization.While many across the ecosystem have placed the blame for the downturn on things like negative tweets from influencers and powerful figures like Elon Musk or yet another announcement that the government of China has banned Bitcoin, more experienced traders and analysts were warning about the potential for a significant pullback for several weeks prior to the sell-off.The rapid rise in prices in 2021 showed some of the classic signs of bubble-like behavior, with overbought alarm bells ringing while Uber drivers and grocery clerks were pleased as punch to offer their opinion on what the next big mover would be.With that said, now seems like a good time to review the various stages of a market cycle to help get a better understanding of what the market has gone through so far and what can potentially be expected in the months and years ahead.The four basic phases of a market cycle, which all traders should have a basic understanding of, are the accumulation phase, the mark-up phase, the distribution phase and the mark-down phase.The accumulation phase takes place after a market has bottomed out and is characterized by the innovators and early adopters buying up the asset for its long-term potential before any significant price moves.This phase was seen in the cryptocurrency market beginning around December 2018 when the price of BTC bottomed below $3,500 and extended all the way until October 2020 when its price began to meaningfully rise above $12,000.The mark-up phase really began to heat up in December 2020 and extended into January 2021 as BTC and the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector were attracting global attention, with the total market capitalization climbing to a high above $2.5 trillion in May as the distribution phase began to initiate.During distribution phases, sellers begin to dominate and the previously bullish sentiment turns mixed, leading to prices getting locked in a trading range. The phase ends when the market reverses direction.Some of the typical chart patterns seen during this time, as outlined by Investopedia, are double and triple tops alongside well-known head-and-shoulders patterns, which were the warning signs presented by BTC and seen by technical analysts ahead of this most recent sell-off.$BTC forming Head and Shoulder pattern.

Bear market begins? #Bitcoin #Cryptocurency pic.twitter.com/E86WwcCKsXSimilar to the 2017–2018 bull market, the price of BTC reached a new all-time high (ATH) and then began to trend down, which resulted in funds rotating out of Bitcoin and into the altcoin market, further propelling the total market capitalization to a record high of $2.53 trillion on May 12.For the astute crypto trader, this pattern was a sign that a mark-down phase was approaching and that it would be wise to take profits as BTC fluctuated between $40,000 and $60,000 and altcoins spiked to all-time highs in preparation to ride out the sell-off and scoop up tokens at a discount during the next bottom.Now that the market has experienced a significant pullback and continues to search for a price floor, it’s a crucial time to monitor price movements, with an eye on looking for good entry points into viable projects.Perhaps the most well-known graphic detailing the typical market cycle is Wall St. Cheat Sheet’s “Psychology of a Market Cycle.” The pattern has appeared in markets of all types, from stocks and commodities to cryptocurrencies and real estate.Looking at the chart for Bitcoin, we can see a similar price pattern that began late in 2020 with a possible “disbelief” phase starting in November. The early run-up in January is similar in appearance to the “hope” phase on the chart above and was followed by a multimonth run-up to a euphoric all-time high in April.The price then dipped down from $64,000 to $47,000 before bouncing back to the $53,000–$60,000 range as complacency began to set in. The sell-off in May propelled the market through the anxiety, denial, panic and capitulation phases, and the ecosystem’s reaction to Musk’s tweets, in addition to other forces putting downward pressure on the market, elicited a significant amount of anger within the community.Now comes the challenge of dealing with the depression of a significantly lower portfolio value and trying to decide if the market has bottomed, signaling that it is a good time to redeploy funds, or if the best thing one can do is sit on their hands and wait for further developments.Major price rallies during this time are often viewed with disbelief as a sucker’s rally — thus, the cycle is complete, and we are back at the beginning.So, does that mean that now is a good time to accumulate your favorite projects’ tokens?Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed correct answer to that question, and it is something for each investor to determine on their own. With previously in-demand tokens now at significant discounts compared with just one month ago, this could be a good time to begin dollar-cost averaging back into the top long-term choices in preparation for the next cycle higher.The typical cycle presented here can be applied to the market as a whole as well as to individual tokens or token sectors.A good example of this is the rise of decentralized finance over the past year, which took the cryptocurrency market by storm, led by the emergence of popular decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and lending platforms like Aave.As seen in the chart above, the DeFi sector as a whole went through its own market cycle pattern that coincided with its rising popularity and use across the ecosystem.A similar pattern was seen in the rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in 2021, but the timing was different, highlighting the idea that sectors move together and hinting at the possible benefits of a sector-based approach to investing in cryptocurrencies.In order to take advantage of these opportunities, traders are at times forced to adopt a contrarian approach. The accumulation phase is often marked by decreased sentiment, but the best time to sell is during the distribution phase when sentiment is at its highest and a majority of traders are going all-in with hopes of great riches.As for the current market outlook, it’s possible that the best course of action is adopting a wait-and-see approach while keeping some dry powder on the sidelines to take advantage of any “flash sales” that may come our way. Whatever you may choose, just remember to do your own research and have a risk management process in place, as the historically volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market shows no signs of abating any time soon.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

545,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) failure to rise above the critical $40,000 to $42,000 resistance zone is keeping crypto traders on tenterhooks. Some analysts view the sharp rebound from $31,000 level as a sign of accumulation at lower levels while others believe the failure to cross above the overhead resistance indicates that Bitcoin is still not out of the woods yet.JPMorgan’s cryptocurrency market analysts, led by global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, pointed out that after the recent fall, the Bitcoin futures market has shifted from contango to backwardation for the first time since 2018. The analysts believe this is a warning of a possible bear market, similar to the one seen in 2018.While Bitcoin’s price remains subdued, one of the fundamental reasons to own Bitcoin received a shot in the arm when the U.S. inflation numbers rose to their highest levels since 2008. If inflation remains high, institutional investors may consider investing in Bitcoin to hedge their portfolios.Related: Bitcoin traders eye ‘crucial’ $38K level as BTC price action consolidates higherWhat are the levels that may suggest the downtrend could be over? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin turned down from the resistance line on June 10 but the bears have not been able to sustain the price down below the 20-day exponential moving average ($36,604). This suggests that buyers are attempting to defend the 20-day EMA.If buyers propel the price above the resistance line, it will nullify the developing bearish descending triangle pattern. The failure of a bearish setup is a bullish sign as it traps several aggressive bears who are forced to close their short positions, resulting in a short squeeze.That could result in a rally to $42,451.67 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($45,271). Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $42,451.67, the BTC/USDT pair could correct to $31,000 and consolidate in this large range for a few days.The trend will shift in favor of the bears if the pair turns down from the current level and breaks below the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone.Ether (ETH) rose above the 20-day EMA ($2,581) on June 9 but the bulls could not build upon this strength. The price again turned down on June 10, suggesting that bears are selling on every minor rally.If bears sink and sustain the price below the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could witness renewed selling that could pull the price down to $2,079 and then to $1,728.74.However, the 20-day EMA has flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) has been taking support near 40, suggesting a range-bound action in the short term.If the price turns up from the current level, the pair may move up to the 20-day EMA and then extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days. A breakout and close above the 50-day SMA ($2,929) will suggest the downtrend could be over.Binance Coin (BNB) rose above the 20-day EMA ($358) on June 9 but the bulls could not sustain the breakout. The bears pulled the price back below the 20-day EMA on June 10. However, the positive thing is that the bulls successfully held on to the trendline support.The bulls will now try to propel the price above $378.77. If they manage to do that, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to the stiff overhead resistance at $433. A breakout and close above this resistance could push the price to the 50-day SMA ($478).A breakout and close above this level will suggest the downtrend could be over. This positive view will be negated if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below the trendline. That could pull the price down to $291.06 and then to $211.70.Cardano (ADA) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($1.61) on June 10, indicating that the sentiment remains negative. The bears will now try to sink and sustain the price below the trendline support.If they succeed, the developing ascending triangle pattern will invalidate. This could result in a drop to $1.24 and then to the critical support at $1. A strong rebound off $1 could keep the ADA/USDT pair range-bound for a few days.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the current level and breaks above $1.63, the pair could rally to $1.94. A breakout and close above this resistance will signal that bulls are back in command. That could result in a retest of the all-time high at $2.47.Dogecoin’s (DOGE) rebound off the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern turned down from the 20-day EMA ($0.34) on June 10, suggesting that bears are selling on every minor relief rally.If bears sink the price below the neckline, it will complete the bearish head and shoulders pattern that could result in a drop to $0.21. The bulls are likely to defend this support aggressively.If the price rebounds strongly off this level, the DOGE/USDT could retest the neckline. If the price turns down from this resistance, the possibility of a break below $0.21 increases. That could result in a drop to $0.10.This negative view will invalidate if the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the moving averages. That could open the gates for a rally to $0.47.XRP turned down from the 20-day EMA ($0.93) on June 10 but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This indicates that bulls are buying on every minor dip.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is trying to sustain above 40, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair could rally to $1.10.A break above this resistance could challenge the 50-day SMA ($1.20). This view will invalidate if the price fails to break above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that bears are not willing to relent. That could result in a drop to the $0.75 to $0.65 support zone.The bulls tried to push Polkadot (DOT) back into the ascending channel on June 10 but failed. This shows that bears are selling at higher levels. The bears will now try to sink the price below $19.60.If they manage to do that, the DOT/USDT pair could start its decline to $17.50 and then to the critical support zone at $15 to $13.63. A bounce off this zone could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price bounces off the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA ($22.81), a retest of $26.50 is possible. A breakout and close above this overhead resistance could result in a rally to $31.28.The bulls tried to propel Uniswap (UNI) above the 20-day EMA ($25.58) on June 9 and 10 but failed. This shows the bears have not thrown in the towel yet. The sellers will now try to sink the price below the $21.50 to $20.46 support zone.If they succeed, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand and the UNI/USDT pair could be on its way to $16.49 and then $13.04.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off $21.50, the pair may again try to rise above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, a move to $30 is likely. If the pair turns down from this resistance, the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $30 to signal the end of the downtrend.Litecoin (LTC) has been trading close to the 20-day EMA ($176) for the past few days but the bulls have not been able to push the price above it. This suggests that bears are defending the 20-day EMA aggressively.The price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.If buyers drive the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the LTC/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($241). The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is attempting to sustain above 40, suggesting the selling pressure is reducing.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the triangle. That could sink the pair to $118.03 and then to $100.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is witnessing a tough tussle between the bulls and the bears near the critical level at $616.04. The bulls are buying the dip below $616.04 but the bears are defending the 20-day EMA ($667).The 20-day EMA is flattening out but the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting the bulls are trying to make a comeback. A breakout and close above the downtrend line will indicate that demand exceeds supply. That may result in a rally to the 50-day SMA ($905).Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the downtrend line, it will suggest that bears are selling on every minor rally. A break below $542.63 will open the gates for a further fall to $468.13.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

546,"While countries like El Salvador have welcomed Bitcoin with open arms, other regions are pushing to legally ban the digital currency. Although this may be, some industry experts believe that Bitcoin (BTC) is here to stay — for good. For example, during an exclusive interview at Bitcoin 2021 in Miami, Yoni Assia, CEO of eToro, told Cointelegraph that he considers Bitcoin to be the “king of crypto,” noting that the most popular digital currency is here to stay:Yet in order for this dream to become a reality, Guy Hirsch, managing director of eToro U.S., told Cointelegraph that people need to believe in the morality of decentralizing money:In order to prepare for a decentralized future, Assia mentioned that eToro is building a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto industry. As such, Assia explained that the combination of crypto assets and equities is important. “The majority of our clients trade both cryptocurrencies as well as stocks in the platform. I think that's definitely a trend that we'll see continuing in the future,” he said.Assia further mentioned that it’s good to see more institutions entering the crypto space, especially when it comes to innovating within decentralized finance, or DeFi:Moreover, Assia mentioned that he thinks there will be a transfer of over $100 trillion dollars over the next 10 years into native digital assets. He noted this will be spurred by the notion that nearly all financial assets will eventually be incorporated into blockchain networks moving forward."
547,"As Miami comes down from the “high” of having hosted the “largest-ever” Bitcoin event, it seems reasonable to ask: Does the Sunshine State’s entrepot really have what it takes to become “the world’s cryptocurrency capital?” — a new role foreseen by its dynamic mayor. If not, could Miami at least become the next Crypto Valley — i.e., a cradle for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation like the Swiss canton of Zug?The optics certainly look good. As the New York Times noted in its coverage of last week’s Bitcoin 2021 gathering, “The city has gone full crypto,” with Bitcoin ATMs sprinkling Miami’s Wynwood neighborhood. Meanwhile, crypto exchange FTX has secured the naming rights for the Miami Heats arena, while there was also a proposal by Miami mayor Francis Suarez to allow citizens to pay taxes with cryptocurrency, among other things.But others caution that a lot of hard work still awaits — and regulatory/legislative events have to take a favorable turn before Miami can lay claim to being the capital of anything in the rapidly evolving cryptoverse.“Miami cannot do this without the Florida state legislature passing pro-crypto legislation,” Zachary Kelman, managing partner at Kelman Law, told Cointelegraph, which followed with a question about Bitcoin 2021 being a milestone event and harbinger of big things to come. Kelman answered, “Yes, but in large part due to the pent-up demand for such a conference given the crypto bull market occurring during the pandemic.”Kelman is no crypto skeptic — quite the opposite. He belongs to the Florida Blockchain Business Association, which is actively lobbying for the necessary crypto-enabling state legislation. If that is secured, Miami could become a crypto hub, even without federal legislation, he said, because:Miami has other advantages over other emerging crypto hubs — even Wyoming, which already has crypto-supportive state laws — Hemang Subramanian, assistant professor at Florida International University’s business school, told Cointelegraph. Miami is an international city with a developed banking infrastructure, and many venture capitalists and high-net-worth individuals are interested in funding innovation. Moreover, “it is one the largest financial hubs in the country, with a large port and a huge expat population from South America, the Caribbean and Europe.”Benjamin Sauter, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim LLP, agreed with Subramanian that Miami was an appealing destination and business hub “particularly as digital currencies begin to take the Latin American market by storm.” Florida also lacks a state income tax — another plus, he told Cointelegraph. But those advantages still may be unable to transform the city into a global crypto hub, even with favorable state legislation:Lane Kasselman, chief business officer of Blockchain.com, which recently announced that it was moving its U.S. headquarters from New York to Miami, was understandably bullish about the company’s sunny new second home and told Cointelegraph, “Miami is already the [new] Crypto Valley, and the announcements last week prove it.” Mayor Suarez is acting as a vocal proponent for technology investment in the region, he added, and “Miami’s welcoming regulatory environment will help fuel crypto innovation.”What about the view from further afield? Thomas Nägele, an attorney who played a role in the evolution of Crypto Valley, told Cointelegraph, “I think that Miami is in a very good position to become a blockchain hub like the Crypto Valley in Switzerland and the crypto country Liechtenstein,” while adding several caveats:This last item, “legal clarity,” is of the utmost importance, Nägele stressed, and “the perfect example for that is Liechtenstein with its TVTG — also known as Blockchain Act — which provides the legal framework for the tokenization of assets.”Ian Simpson, senior marketing and communication manager at Bitcoin Suisse AG — a company based in the Crypto Valley — told Cointelegraph, “One challenge for larger cities and countries is that crypto can be ‘swallowed up’ by the wider tech ecosystem, and this can dilute the attractiveness to blockchain projects.” He added, “Close contact and access to ideas, talent and quality services are some of the things that have made Switzerland’s Crypto Valley what it is. We’ll have to wait and see how things develop in Miami.”When asked if Bitcoin 2021 should be viewed as a milestone event for the crypto and blockchain space, Simpson answered that while it was a welcoming event, particularly after all the lockdowns of the past year, “It does not seem to have marked any significant change or development in the community — and as we saw it had absolutely no effect on the markets.”Nägele, for his part, called it “a pity” that most European countries were on a quarantine list and were unable to join the Bitcoin 2021 gathering, “but what my friends were telling me, it was an amazing event, and this is always a good start for an ecosystem.” While Kasselman commented, “There’s no question we’ve reached a critical inflection point where crypto has moved from niche to mainstream,” he further explained to Cointelegraph:Overall, is it even possible to identify the crypto/blockchain world’s nerve center, and if so, could it change? It may shift from time to time, said Nägele, “depending on where attractive conditions exist for the relevant companies. Europe and especially Switzerland and Liechtenstein were certainly early adopters, and recently, Asia is catching up. I really look forward to welcoming Miami to the club, but finally, I hope that we consider the world as the crypto hub.”Simpson added, “The U.S. has a strong position in the blockchain and crypto space by virtue of its lead in technology and with the recent IPO of Coinbase. However, Europe and Switzerland seem to offer more openness on the regulatory side, and the Asian ecosystem also has a great deal of weight by virtue of scale.” But it is still difficult to point to a single center of gravity in the blockchain ecosystem, he added.Related: The female speakers who made an impact at Bitcoin2021 in Miami“While the U.S. and Europe get much of the press, Latin America and Asia show the fastest retail user growth,” added Kasselman. “It’s likely as crypto becomes more ubiquitous across financial services, we’ll see emerging markets accelerate adoption for the core products, and mature markets grow their usage of the expanding crypto ecosystem.”“I think Miami could easily be the American capital of crypto if it isn’t already,” noted Kelman. “However, without federal legislative support, it is impossible for Miami to become the international crypto capital,” and recent signs “point to more onerous federal legislation rather than crypto-friendly laws in the near term.”Subramanian said that regulation always follows innovation, and “in a democracy, the people’s ‘will’ will eventually play out.” That is, the requisite state and federal legislation will come eventually. “If Zug in Switzerland can become a crypto-blockchain haven, Miami can too. It is more diverse, more international, and much more capital-friendly,” he added."
548,"JPMorgan is the latest source to respond to El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as legal currency within the country.In a client note tweeted by @DocumentingBTC, the United States banking giant stated that there was little economic benefit to El Salvador adopting BTC as a parallel legal tender to the U.S. dollar.JP Morgan on El Salvador adopting #Bitcoin

549,"The United States Internal Revenue Service classifies crypto as property, meaning you can trigger taxes every time you use crypto to buy something. You might be using it to pay for a Tesla electric vehicle — oh, sorry, that’s not possible anymore — a cup of coffee or even a castle in Europe. You might be paying someone for services, either as an independent contractor or as an employee. But no matter what the transaction, you may have a gain or a loss, something quite apart from the income tax impact on the person you are paying. The tax impact might even be made more difficult by the wild fluctuations in value that tend to characterize crypto investments. Think about paying for services too: Say you pay someone as an independent contractor; to report the payment, you’ll need to issue them an IRS Form 1099. Whatever the type or amount of crypto you use, the IRS will say you paid them the current market value of the crypto on that day.When you pay an independent contractor and issue a Form 1099, you can’t enter “1,000 Bitcoin (BTC)” on the form. You must put the value in U.S. dollars as of the time of payment. The contractor you pay might keep the crypto or might sell or transfer it the same day, but that doesn’t impact your taxes.How about wages paid to employees? Wages paid to employees using crypto are taxable and must be reported on a Form W-2. They are also subject to withholding and payroll taxes.Related: Crypto taxes, reporting and tax audits in 2021However, if you pay someone in property, how do you withhold taxes? You could pay some cash and some Bitcoin and withhold plenty on the cash, but that can be complex and messy. Of course, you could also opt for paying the person as a contractor. But remember, worker status issues can happen in any context, including this one.Thus, investing and dealing in crypto inevitably involves significant tax issues, whether you like it or not. It is no secret that the IRS wants you to report your crypto gains. You can report crypto losses too, but the IRS does not care as much about whether you claim those. Income and gains, on the other hand, matter a lot to the IRS. The IRS still believes there are major compliance problems in the crypto community, so there’s continuing distrust and extra scrutiny.Related: More IRS summonses for crypto exchange account holdersThe latest evidence of this continuing issue is that the U.S. Treasury Department expects to publish new rules saying businesses that receive crypto worth more than $10,000 would have to file a currency transaction report with the government naming names and giving details. You might think you won’t get caught, but the risks are growing. The best way to avoid penalties, or worse, is to disclose and report as accurately as you can.Remember those 10,000 letters sent by the IRS to crypto taxpayers? And how about all the IRS summonses to Coinbase, Kraken and others? The hunt is still on, as the crypto tax question on IRS Form 1040 should indicate. The Department of Justice’s Tax Division successfully argued that the mere failure to check a box related to foreign bank account reporting is willfulness, per se; the same argument could get applied to crypto accounts.Related: The crypto FBAR: Implications beyondWillful failures carry higher penalties and an increased threat of criminal investigation. The Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS has met with tax authorities from other countries to share data and enforcement strategies about cryptocurrency tax evasion.When you file your taxes, the IRS asks a simple question: “At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?” It sounds pretty simple, yes or no, right? What could go wrong? It’s not asking for any numbers or details — although if you sold some, it should go elsewhere on your tax return. After all, since crypto is property to the IRS, any sale will produce either a gain or loss. Many other transfers will as well, even a swap of one type of crypto for another. The latest step was the announcement that the Treasury Department plans to impose new reporting requirements for crypto.Soon, banks and financial institutions will have to report information to the IRS. Exchanges, custodians and crypto payment services are slated to have to do the same. Curiously, the government is taking pages of its playbook from the rules surrounding cash transactions, even though the IRS said way back in 2014 that crypto was property, not currency.For cash, reports go on IRS Form 8300 for payments of over $10,000. The IRS even has a list of FAQs regarding reporting cash. For many years, businesses have been required to report cash payments of more than $10,000, which has prompted all sorts of (usually ill-advised) behavior by people to try to avoid doing so. So-called “structuring transactions” can be a crime, even if all the cash you are trying to use is entirely yours.Therefore, if the $10,000 baseline is implemented for crypto reporting, my guess is there will be people trying to keep something private who end up in trouble for trying to sidestep a reporting trigger. The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to report currency transactions above $10,000 to the IRS. This law also makes it a crime to structure currency transactions to avoid the reports. The IRS Criminal Investigation Division enforces the rules on cash transactions.Yet, a 2017 report said that the law is enforced primarily against individuals and businesses whose income was obtained legally. That’s what happened to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who was indicted over structuring his own money. Eventually, he was sentenced to 15 months in prison. Could crypto enforcement end up the same way?If the new crypto reporting threshold of $10,000 goes the same way as cash reporting has, some people may try to structure around the reporting. If they do, and if the rules are similar to the cash reporting rules, that could be quite dangerous.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal advice.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

551,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded in a higher range on Friday, with analysts keen to see which critical levels would fall next.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD retaining $35,000 support overnight on Thursday while so far staying clear of $40,000.A push higher had taken the pair to $39,000 before the consolidation phase began, but overall, Bitcoin was yet to make a decisive move up or down on longer timeframes.For popular trader Rekt Capital, $38,000 needed to be flipped to support.“The ~$38,000 area for BTC is the one to watch right now,” he noted on Wednesday, noting its significance in the current consolidation cycle.Since then, volatility has waned, but broad calls for a significant market drop may ultimately go unanswered.As Cointelegraph reported, fellow trader Crypto Ed was among those forecasting a return to near $30,000 as Bitcoin’s next move. On Friday, however, this was looking increasingly unlikely.“Printed a couple of HL’s and starting to think we don’t complete that leg lower,” he told Twitter followers, with a chart likewise highlighting a crunch point at near $38,000.Related: Bitcoin price hits stock-to-flow rebound level not seen since 2017 all-time highA look at buy and sell positions on largest global exchange Binance confirmed resistance at $38,500 and $40,000, respectively.

Traders were faced with losses of around 4% across major tokens on Friday, with only Amp (AMP) positing noticeable daily gains of 17%.Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance thus improved as it drifted higher, hitting 44% from under 42% earlier in the week."
552,"While El Salvador adopts Bitcoin as legal tender, one Dutch official blasted the cryptocurrency, calling for an urgent blanket ban.Pieter Hasekamp, director of the Dutch Bureau for Economic Analysis under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, published an essay entitled “The Netherlands must ban bitcoin.”In line with the essay’s title, Hasekamp lists a wide list of reasons why the Dutch government must enforce an immediate total ban on mining, trading and holding Bitcoin (BTC). According to the official, this could cause the price to plummet because Bitcoin “has no intrinsic value and is only valuable because others may accept it.”The executive cited a common anti-crypto narrative, arguing that any cryptocurrency is unable to fulfill any of the three functions of money as a unit of account, means of payment and store of value. He also cited other common anti-Bitcoin arguments, such as security concerns, risks of fraud and scams, and argued that the crypto is useful tool for criminal actors.Hasekamp said that the Netherlands has been lagging behind countries that have moved to “curb the crypto hype” in recent years. “Dutch regulators attempted to tighten up the supervision of trading platforms, but without much success. The Central Planning Bureau pointed out the risks of crypto trading in 2018, but concluded that stricter regulation was not yet necessary,” the official wrote.Related: Dutch regulators unsure of number of crypto investors in NetherlandsIn his essay, Hasekamp paid special attention to Gresham’s law, a monetary principle that states that overvalued currency, or “bad money,” tends to drive a legally undervalued currency, or “good money,” out of circulation. Calling Bitcoin “bad money,” Hasekamp argued that Gresham’s law could work the opposite way with Bitcoin:"
553,"Benoît Cœuré, Bitcoin (BTC) critic and the head of the innovation hub at the Bank of International Settlements, called El Salvador’s historic move to make BTC legal tender in the country an “interesting experiment.”According to Reuters, Cœuré made this assertion during the launch of the BIS’s fourth innovation hub in England on Friday, stating:As previously reported by Cointelegraph, El Salvador’s parliament passed a bill to make Bitcoin legal tender in the country. The legislative vote on president Nayib Bukele’s “Bitcoin Law” passed by an overwhelming supermajority of 62 out of 84 votes.Back in November 2018, Cœuré called Bitcoin the “evil spawn of the [2008] financial crisis.” Cœuré’s comments about the need for strict crypto regulations are a common theme within the BIS, with general manager Agustín Carstens also routinely calling for more stringent cryptocurrency laws.Cœuré’s comments are coming on the heels of similarly stark warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the wake of El Salvador’s decision. Reacting to the news, the IMF stated that the decision could pose significant legal and financial ramifications.Related: IMF plans to meet with El Salvador’s president, potentially discussing move to adopt BitcoinIndeed, reports indicate that Bitcoin could be a topic of discussion between the IMF and El Salvador’s president on a planned $1-billion program.On Thursday, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a consultation paper that placed Bitcoin in its highest risk category. As part of its recommendations, the global banking regulator called for banks keen on crypto exposure to hold $1 capital for every $1 worth of BTC held in custody."
554,"A Texas state regulator has officially affirmed that Texas state-chartered banks are allowed to store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) for their customers.The Texas Department of Banking, a state regulatory agency chartering state banks and supervising financial services, issued a notice on Thursday stating that local banks are permitted to provide crypto services in the state.The agency noted that Texas banks “may provide customers with virtual currency custody services, so long as the bank has adequate protocols in place to effectively manage the risks and comply with applicable law.”The regulator briefly explained cryptocurrencies, stressing that digital currencies do not exist in a physical form, but on a blockchain, and thus require the owner to hold private keys to access them. The authority further stated that banks can store crypto on customers’ behalf, either by keeping copies of the customer’s private keys or holding the assets directly in the bank’s custody by creating new private keys held by the bank.“As with the method of custody services, several secure storage options are available to the bank, each of which has distinctive characteristics pertaining to level of security and accessibility. The bank will have to determine which storage option best fits the circumstances,” the agency wrote.Related: US FDIC seeks insight on banks’ role in cryptocurrency marketsThe department also mentioned that the bank should confirm the existence of adequate coverage with its insurance carrier as a measure to protect its crypto holdings.The regulatory notice comes shortly after members of the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill to recognize cryptocurrencies under commercial law last month. Other jurisdictions in the United States, such as Wyoming and Nebraska, have been actively embracing crypto custody services by state-chartered banks, with Wyoming chartering Kraken exchange as its first crypto bank last September. Federally chartered banks also received authorization for providing crypto custody services in July 2020."
555,"Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of social media network Twitter and founder and CEO of financial services company Square, has confirmed he is planning to integrate Bitcoin’s Lightning Network sidechain with at least one of his businesses.On Friday, Dorsey responded to a question from Twitter user Deyonté, who had requested that Dorsey integrate the Lightning Network into Twitter or BlueSky — the decentralized social network Twitter has devoted manpower to developing since 2019.In response, Dorsey responded, “Only a matter of time.”Only a matter of timeDorsey’s comment appears intentionally vague, with the remark appearing open to be interpreted as confirming that either BlueSky or Twitter, or even both companies, could be eying a Lightning integration.Twitter user Mklad also suggested Dorsey’s pro-Lightning remarks could relate to Square’s recent acquisition of Jay-Z’s failed music streaming platform, Tidal.Dorsey’s tweet comes amid recent moves from Square to expand its digital asset operations.Earlier this month, Dorsey revealed that Square intends to develop an open-source non-custodial Bitcoin hardware wallet.

556,"Economist Nouriel Roubini and former risk analyst Nassim Taleb took aim at crypto at the CoinGeek Conference this week, while the always controversial Craig Wright boasted that the Bitcoin SV blockchain was on track to hit billions of transactions a second.Taleb, the author of best-selling economic books Black Swan and Skin in the Game, was a controversial addition to the lineup of the CoinGeek Conference in Zurich and came under fire on social media for giving Bitcoin SV legitimacy.Roubini, meanwhile, offered a “greatest hits” version of his attacks against crypto, familiar from crypto conferences prior to the pandemic.Taleb is gone. Calvin is going to brainwash him even more thoroughly at the Coingeek conference next week. He will be wined and dined and schmoozed and very soon he will be saying ""Craig is Satoshi"".Roubini argued that cryptographic tokens — which include Bitcoin SV (BSV) presumably — are unnecessary and should be isolated from the value of the decentralized data verification enabled by blockchain technology.“Data is very valuable, it’s the new oil,” he explained, lamenting that “99%” of the fintech application “has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies.” What is needed, Roubini explained, is a service that is “reliable, that stores the data, says who owns it and who pays for it.”Taleb followed Roubini on the panel, agreeing that the data utilities enabled by cryptocurrency should be understood as a separate phenomenon to the cryptographic tokens issued by many blockchain projects. He shared his belief that those who need crypto and those who can use it are not aligned, adding:Related: Bitcoin’s usefulness is on a whole other level, depending on where you liveThe host attempted to get the panel back on track, asking Taleb if he agrees that “BTC does not represent what the Bitcoin white paper describes.”In response, Taleb admitted he thinks Bitcoin, in its current form, does not resemble the white paper but countered that “the currency in the white paper may not be what we are looking for.”NChain chief scientist Craig Wright talked up BSV, asserting it was “never designed to be a currency, it’s digital cash” and went on to make the claim:As you might expect, the Bitcoiners who did tune in were hate watching the broadcast, including YouTuber BTC Sessions, who shared that they only “hopped on the stream for a second just to give it a thumbs down.”Wright’s chief critic, Arther van Pelt, also tuned in to throw stones and tweeted that the panel was receiving very little viewership, calling it a “clown show.”Hardly 650 viewers on YouTube when Ian Grigg, Craig #Faketoshi Wright, Nouriel Roubini and Nassim Taleb are on stage. ‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/dtwD8fE93v"
557,"The Bitcoin Mining Council made a formal debut on Thursday as the debate regarding the environmental impact of the digital asset intensifies.The Bitcoin Mining Council describes itself as a “voluntary and open forum of Bitcoin miners committed to the network and its core principles.” Its mandate is to promote transparency, endorse good practices, and foster Bitcoin education according to the official website.MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor is one of the founding members, who posted a call to arms on his Twitter feed on Thursday.The organization consists of a group of energy-conscious North American Bitcoin mining companies. It was first suggested by Elon Musk in a tweet in late May, but he has since clarified that he will have no role at the council. The site goes out of its way to underline this point:In addition to MicroStrategy, founding members include investment management firm Galaxy Digital, blockchain mining company Argo, blockchain technology firm Hive and Bitcoin mining company Riot. The founding members will cover any running costs and invite any Bitcoin miner from anywhere around the world to join. It stated that any miner joining should:The BMC will hold quarterly meetings in order to analyze mining trends, partner with industry researchers, gather data for educational purposes, and foster growth in the North American BTC mining industry.The group confirmed that it is completely independent of the Bitcoin network itself and has no intentions to disrupt its decentralization.It added that the council believes that Bitcoin’s energy usage is a feature, not a bug, providing tremendous network security. The energy consumption of global mining operations has come under the spotlight recently in the wake of Musk’s comments regarding its environmental impact.The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index estimates Bitcoin’s annual electricity consumption is currently somewhere between that of Holland and the United Arab Emirates.Related: Nic Carter takes aim at claims Bitcoin is an environmental disasterFollowing recent state clampdowns, China’s hash rate dominance is dwindling while the United States’ is increasing, as mining operations can tap into cheap renewable energy in states such as Texas.More firms are setting up operations in the U.S., attracted by this abundance of renewable energy. The latest collaboration between mining software company Luxor and institutional Bitcoin technology and financial services firm NYDIG aims to foster growth in the rapidly expanding industry.However, one of the biggest winners for geographical reasons is neighboring Kazakhstan."
558,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape, and enterprise blockchain integrations.This week, following a tumultuous few weeks of regulation, the Bitcoin world’s focus shifted to Miami and Latin America. Searches for Bitcoin on China’s most popular social media app WeChat stabilized between 1 million and 3 million per day, a stark difference from the peaks of over 10 million that were seen in late May.Baidu, China’s dominant search engine, restricted searches for exchanges Binance, Huobi and OKEx early in the week. Typically, large internet companies work under the watchful eye of government and party officials, making this move somewhat expected. Filtering out keywords isn’t always the most effective solution, as searches for “Binance App Download” still take users to the requested link. It’s worth pointing out that the government has limited authority in these cases since most of these big exchanges, particularly Binance, are registered in other countries and have a limited physical presence in China.More effective was the silencing of cryptocurrency influencer accounts on microblogging platform Weibo. According to reports on Cointelegraph, at least a dozen accounts were suspended with a message that they had violated relevant laws and guidelines. This can have a much more sobering impact on the Chinese cryptocurrency community, as influencers are often a primary source of information, especially for users who don’t access traditional western social media platforms.On June 9, a district government in western Xinjiang issued a “notice to immediately suspend virtual currency mining enterprises.” The report announced that companies engaged in digital currency mining must halt production by 2 pm on June 9 and report the suspension to a local reform commission. This resulted in significant drops in global hashing power, with Chinese-backed Ant Pool dropping by more than 30%. The last month has seen a bevy of regulations against mining companies as China prepares to try and meet carbon emissions goals. Miners are still scrambling to adjust to new regulations, with many heading to more lenient countries like neighboring Kazakhstan.The Monetary Authority of Singapore announced it has received over 300 applications for crypto payments and exchange licenses. Singapore is a common location for Chinese companies to domicile, as it is home to a thriving fintech sector but remains close to the mainland, both in terms of geography and cultural ties. One of the companies disclosed was internet giant Alibaba. Alibaba has come under the microscope back in China for its lending practices, so it’s no surprise that Alibaba and other Chinese companies might want to diversify their financial offerings in other regulatory regions.On June 7, China’s high-ranking Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued guidelines on accelerating the application of blockchain technology in the industrial sector. It targeted 2025 as the year that blockchain should penetrate fields such as supply chain management and traceability for internationally competitive enterprises. This will be of interest to a number of public and private chains that are able to develop within the confines of the Chinese regulatory framework. Despite cryptocurrency facing strong backlash, the Chinese government hasn’t backed down from its hopes for blockchain to be a driver of economic growth in the country.For those looking to better understand China’s ambitions in this area, government-backed Blockchain-based Service Network hosted a webinar about China’s pursuits in emerging technologies. China technology experts Winston Ma and Paul Schulte covered a number of topics including blockchain technology, central bank digital currencies and even some more controversial geopolitical issues. Cointelegraph’s Man in Shanghai himself was on hand to moderate, keeping an unbiased eye on things.On June 8, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority released a “Fintech 2025” strategy to enhance research on a central bank digital currency. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is working with the Innovation Hub of the National Bank for Settling and Clearing to bring a CBDC to the retail level. This area is an interesting space to watch to determine how the e-HKD will be similar to the e-CNY, and what that means for the financial future of the region."
559,"Some attendees of the Bitcoin 2021 event in Miami have tested positive for COVID-19 after returning home from the conference, leading to a wave of negative media coverage and social media speculation it could turn into a “super spreader event.”Bloomberg called Miami Bitcoin a “Covid hot spot” while Gizmodo reported the conference “may be the latest COVID-19 super spreader event.”Arcane Research chief investment officer Eric Wall was among those to contract the virus, tweeting on Thursday that he underwent a CT scan after suffering from a “high fever” and “chest pains,” with medical staff having suspected he may have a blood clot in his lungs. No blood clot was found, and Wall was discharged from the hospital and returned home.Luke Martin of automated trading software developer Coinist also admitted to testing positive for COVID-19.According to CNBC, at least 12,000 people attended the event, which did not require proof of vaccination or enforce a mask mandate. The event lasted for three days at Miami’s Mana Wynwood convention center, cramming into crowded auditoriums while social distancing was not enforced.The event was Miami’s first major conference since the beginning of the pandemic. According to a New York Times report, lines to enter the building “stretched for more than a mile.”Miami mayor and Bitcoin proponent Francis Suarez spoke at the event and was introduced on-stage as “probably the most irresponsible politician in all of America” and “the mayor of the meccas of freedom.”Here's some footage of the #Bitcoin Conference.

With an estimated 50,000+ visitors over 2-days, almost no one was seen wearing a mask.

As of now, it's unknown exactly how many people were exposed. I'll be sure to post any further updates! pic.twitter.com/QeVj0tJYEZSocial media reports have estimated the number of attendees and positive tests may be higher than mainstream reports. Influencer Mr. Whale told his roughly 235,000 Twitter followers that “dozens” of conference-goers have since tested positive, estimating the event could have seen more than 50,000 attendees.Related: The female speakers who made an impact at Bitcoin 2021 in MiamiA screenshot of an image retweeted by Bitcoin 2021 organizer Dylan LeClair that scathingly dismissed the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card system has circulated on social media.Our future captains of financeBitcoin 2021 was not the first crypto conference to have COVID-19 transmissions, with Torus Labs co-founder and CEO Zhen Yu Yong urging attendees of the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris and ETHLondonUK Hackathon in early 2020 to get tested when he was diagnosed with the coronavirus after participating in the events."
560,"The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, also called the MACD, is a trend-following momentum indicator used widely by traders. Although the MACD is a lagging indicator, it can be very useful in identifying possible trend changes.The MACD oscillates above and below a zero line, also known as the centerline. The shorter moving average is subtracted from a longer moving average to arrive at the value of the MACD. A signal line, which is the exponential moving average of the MACD completes the indicator.The blue line is the MACD and the red line is the signal line. When the blue line crosses above the red line, it is a signal to buy and when the blue line falls below the red line, it is a trigger to sell. A cross above the centerline is also a buy signal.Let’s have a look at how to use the indicator for better entries and exits from a variety of positions. Afterward, we’ll investigate how the MACD is analyzed during pullbacks and in an uptrend. Lastly, we'll take a brief look at the importance of divergences on the MACD.Compared to legacy markets, cryptocurrencies witness large movements in a short time. Therefore, the entries and exits should be quick to capture a large part of the move but without too many whipsaw trades.When a new uptrend starts, it generally remains in force for a few weeks or months. However, every bull phase has its share of corrections. Traders should aim to stay with the trend and not get stopped out by every minor pullback along the way.The goal should be to enter the position early as the new uptrend starts and remain with the position until a trend reversal is signaled. However, that is easier said than done. If the indicator gives too many signals, there will be several unwanted trades which will incur large commissions and be emotionally draining.On the other hand, if the time frames are chosen to give fewer signals, a large part of the trend could be missed as the indicator will be slow in identifying reversals.This problem was addressed by MACD creator Gerald Appel in his book, Technical Analysis: Power Tools for active investors.Appel highlights how two MACD indicators can be used during strong trends, with the more sensitive one being used for entries and the less sensitive one being used for exits.Related: Unsure about buying the dip? This key trading indicator makes it easierThe default value used for the MACD indicator by most charting software is the 12- to 26-day combination. However, for the subsequent examples, let’s use one MACD with the 19- to 39-day combination which is less sensitive and will be used for generating sell signals. The second one will be more sensitive, using the 6- to 19-day MACD combination which will be used for buy signals.Bitcoin (BTC) was trading in a small range in September 2020 and during that period, both MACD indicators were largely flat. In October, as the BTC/USDT pair started an uptrend, the MACD gave a buy signal when the indicator crossed above the centerline in mid-October of 2020.After entering the trade, watch how the MACD came close to the signal line on four occasions (marked as ellipses on the chart) on the sensitive 6- to 19-day MACD combination. This could have resulted in an early exit, leaving a large part of the gains on the table as the uptrend was only getting started.On the other hand, notice how the less sensitive 19- to 39-day combination remained steady during the uptrend. This could have made it easier for the trader to stay in the trade till the MACD dropped below the signal line on Nov. 26, 2020, triggering a sell signal.In another example, Binance Coin (BNB) crossed over the centerline on July 7, 2020, triggering a buy signal. However, the sensitive MACD quickly turned down and dipped below the signal line on July 6, as the BNB/USDT pair entered a minor correction.Comparatively, the less sensitive MACD remained above the signal line until Aug. 12, 2020, capturing a larger portion of the trend.Traders who find it difficult to keep track of two MACD indicators can also use the default 12- to 26-day combination. Litecoin’s (LTC) journey from about $75 to $413.49 generated five buy and sell signals. All the trades generated good entry (marked as ellipses) and exit (marked with arrows) signals.Related: 3 ways traders use moving averages to read market momentumTraders can also use the MACD to buy pullbacks. During corrections in an uptrend, the MACD drops to the signal line but as the price resumes its uptrend the MACD rebounds off the signal line. This formation, which looks similar to a hook, can give a good entry opportunity.In the example above, Cardano (ADA) crossed over the centerline on Jan. 8, 2020, signaling a buy. However, as the up-move stalled, the MACD dropped close to the signal line on Jan. 26, 2020 but did not break below it. As the price recovered, the MACD broke away from the signal line and resumed its move higher.This gave an opportunity to traders who may have missed buying the cross above the centerline. The sell signal was generated on Feb. 16 just as the ADA/USDT pair was starting a deep correction.Bitcoin’s price continued to make higher highs between Feb. 21, 2021, and April 14 but the MACD indicator made lower highs during the period, forming a bearish divergence. This was a sign that the momentum was weakening.Traders should become cautious when a bearish divergence forms and avoid taking long trades during such a period. The long bearish divergence in this case culminated with a massive fall.Litecoin shows how the MACD formed a bullish divergence during a strong downtrend from July to December 2019. Traders who bought the crossover above the centerline may have been whipsawed in September and again in November.This shows that traders should wait for the price action to show signs of changing its trend before acting on the MACD divergences.The MACD indicator captures the trend and also can be used to gauge an asset's momentum. Depending on the market conditions and the asset being analyzed,  traders may vary the period setting of the MACD. If a coin is a fast mover, a more sensitive MACD could be used. With slow movers, the default setting or a less sensitive MACD may be used. Traders can also use a combination of a less sensitive and more sensitive MACD indicator for better results.However, there is no perfect indicator that works all the time. Even with the above permutations and combinations, trades will move opposite to expectations.Traders should deploy money management principles to cut losses quickly and protect the paper gains when the trade moves as per the assumption.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

561,"Bitcoin (BTC) spending over three weeks in the $30,000 range is proving a crucial test for one of its best-known price models.As noted by Philip Swift, co-founder of trading suite Decentrader, on Thursday, Bitcoin is issuing a major challenge to the stock-to-flow price forecasting tool.BTC price action has been hovering in a lower corridor between $30,000 and $40,000 since mid-May. This has worried day traders, while vintage bulls have called for calm and a long-term mindset.As Cointelegraph reported, the stock-to-flow model continues to accommodate such behavior, even if its estimates call for a BTC/USD value closer to $70,000.Its creator, PlanB, has nonetheless voiced concern over the future. Should current levels remain for a longer period, his model risks becoming invalidated for the first time in its history.Highlighting spot price divergence from the stock-to-flow average, Swift explained that such instances have in fact occurred before. Each time, Bitcoin bounced off a given price point relative to the stock-to-flow average to eventually hit new all-time highs.“It’s a long time since price has been this far below S2F line,” he told Twitter followers.Previously, PlanB suggested that this year’s Bitcoin bull cycle is more reminiscent of 2013 than 2017 thanks to the veracity of May’s price dip.Both 2013 and 2017 ultimately saw a two-tier run to an all-time high. The first peak was followed by a significant drawdown in each instance, which then reversed to spawn a run to a new top.PlanB still believes that $100,000 per Bitcoin will appear this year, while stock-to-flow calls for either a $100,000 or $288,000 average price between now and 2024.Related: Bitcoin drops below $36K as century-old financial model predicts big BTC crashEarlier this week, he referenced two key day moving averages (DMAs) as a potential launchpad for a recovery in the coming months.“If June close will be $54K (or higher) and July, August also $54K (or higher), then 50DMA will bounce off 200DMA and stay above 200DMA,” he tweeted."
562,"On Friday, June 11, a total of $565 million in Bitcoin (BTC) options are set to expire. This is significant because the last couple of weeks have been a massive deception for bulls. After all, the price was struggling to sustain the $33,000 support.However, an unexpected bullish turn of events led to an 18.5% hike from the $31,000 low on June 8 to $38,491 today. This strong move saved the bulls because any level below $34,000 would have wiped 98% of the current call (buy) options.First, MicroStrategy, a publicly-traded company that holds over $3.2 billion worth of Bitcoin, concluded a $500 million bond offering on June 8, and the proceeds will be used to buy more BTC.On the same day, El Salvador's Legislative Assembly approved Bitcoin as legal tender in the country. President Nayib Bukele stated that accepting Bitcoin would be mandatory for all businesses. Furthermore, the government announced that it would eventually hold $150 million worth of BTC in a trust fund.The positive newsflow continued on June 8 after Victory Capital, a $157 billion asset manager, announced plans to invest in a private fund that tracks the Nasdaq Crypto Index, 62% comprised of Bitcoin, 32% Ether (ETH), and 6% in other altcoins.The initial picture slightly favors bears because the call-to-put ratio stands at 0.93, although this indicator values every option the same. However, the right to acquire Bitcoin at $42,000 in less than 24 hours is currently worthless, so this call option is trading below $40 each.Related: Report says El Salvador Bitcoin pump failed to attract smart money, for nowA similar effect is in place for the neutral-to-bearish put options at $30,000 and lower. Holders have no benefit in rolling it over for the upcoming weeks because these contracts also became worthless. Therefore, to better assess how traders are positioned for Friday's options expiry, analysts need to concentrate on the $33,000 to $41,000 range.Bitcoin soared over 11% to $37,100 on June 9, causing some neutral-to-bullish call options to enter a profitable position. With less than 24 hours until Friday's expiry, the call (buy) options up to $41,000 amount to 3,235 BTC contracts, currently worth $120 million.On the other hand, the neutral-to-bearish put options down to $33,000 total 3,045 BTC contracts, presently valued at $113 million. Therefore, both sides are virtually balanced for Friday's expiry.Had Bitcoin remained below $34,000, bears would have an $84 million advantage, but the sequence of positive events seems to have been just enough to salvage the situation.While there are no guarantees that the price will hold, at least the incentives for both sides to pressure the price are currently balanced.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

563,"Bitcoin (BTC) gained more free publicity this week as inflation data showed that prices are rising faster than even experts had anticipated.The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on June 10 from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also revealed that hourly average earnings for United States workers are at their lowest this century.One of Bitcoin's best friends is inflation. Its inherently deflationary nature allows its users to save for the future without worrying that inflation is eradicating the value of those savings.Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, central banks have launched unprecedented money-printing programs, and the consequences are now becoming worryingly clear. In May, 12 months after the coronavirus pandemic began to take hold outside of China, the U.S. CPI rose 0.6%.This is 5% higher than the same month last year and means that U.S. inflation is now at its highest since 2008, the year of the financial crisis.“The May CPI report shows reopening-sensitive categories dominating price pressures for a second straight month,” Bloomberg analysts said in comments accompanying the report.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bitcoin proponents were quick to raise the alarm.""The US just hit a 13 year high inflation rate. This was unexpected by policymakers and economists,"" Dan Held, growth lead at crypto exchange Kraken said in a series of tweets.Held noted that wages had failed to keep up with any changes, meaning that U.S. workers were earning on average less per hour than at any time in the 21st century, when adjusted for inflation.""Wages didn’t keep up with inflation, so workers got poorer. TL;DR wages are more 'sticky' than prices which can be adjusted much more easily,"" he concluded, highlighting a similar period in the 1970s.Other Bitcoin figures have seized on inflation in recent years as a prime example of how the fiat monetary system deceives those it forces to participate.While the CPI still looks relatively low in percentage terms, a plethora of assets are not included in the gauge. Examples of these are products and services which provide a citizen with reassurance for the future, such as real estate and college tuition.Related: Bitcoin is a 'masterpiece of monetary engineering' Michael Saylor tells Austin DavisMicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor and Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, have been especially vocal about the disparity.""CPI is a misleading measure of inflation,"" Saylor argued in March."
564,"The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), a global committee of banking supervisors and central banks, has proposed new requirements for banks that want to hold cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC).In a consultation paper published Thursday, the committee provided preliminary proposals for the prudential treatment of crypto exposure by banks.The paper built on the contents of the committee’s 2019 discussion paper and responses received from various stakeholders and international industry figures.Crypto’s perceived volatility and potential for illicit use led the BCBS to assign a 1,250% risk weight to Bitcoin. This essentially means that banks must hold $1 in capital for each $1 worth of exposure they have to Bitcoin.According to the paper, this would ensure that there is sufficient capital to absorb a full write-off of crypto-asset exposure “without exposing depositors and other senior creditors of the banks to a loss.”The BCBS proposed to split crypto assets into two broad categories: those eligible for treatment under the Basel Framework with some modifications, and assets like Bitcoin, which are subject to the new conservative prudential treatment.Related: Global banking regulator plans to hold consultation on crypto exposureThe first category would include tokenized traditional assets as well as “crypto assets with effective stabilization mechanisms” — i.e., stablecoins.The second group includes Bitcoin and other assets that “fail to meet any of the classification conditions” like applying a stabilization mechanism.The BCBS noted that a high risk weight of 1,250% will lead to a “conservative outcome” for direct exposures to crypto assets. Regarding crypto derivatives, however, the committee noted that “Care should be taken in defining what the ‘value’ is in the formula to ensure the outcome is similarly conservative.”"
565,"Dubbed as “the largest Bitcoin event in history,” Bitcoin 2021 consisted of 12,000 attendees from across the globe. Undoubtedly, Bitcoin (BTC) adoption is growing at an impressive rate. Yet judging by the attendance at Bitcoin 2021, men still appear to be the primary audience for Bitcoin. While the lines to the bathroom made it obvious that there were nowhere near as many female attendees as there were males, there were also fewer women speakers than men at Bitcoin 2021. For example, only 27 women are featured on the Bitcoin 2021 website, which consists of over 150 speakers in total.Although this was the case, the 27 women who did speak at Bitcoin 2021 left a lasting impact. The female speakers at Bitcoin 2021 discussed a number of different topics including regulations, technical aspects, legal requirements and more.United States Senator of Wyoming Cynthia Lummis discussed how regulators can encourage Bitcoin innovation in the country. Lummis was joined by Representative Warren Davidson for the panel “Bringing Bitcoin Innovation Home to America.”Lummis kickstarted the discussion by explaining how she got involved with Bitcoin, saying: “I got into Bitcoin after being Wyoming State Treasurer. I was looking for great stores of value.”Lummis mentioned that the “fun” thing about Bitcoin is that it’s very non-partisan and bi-partisan at the same time. As such, she noted that it’s a great space for those struggling with other issues that are decisive in Congress. “Bitcoin is a great ‘Switzerland’ kind of a place for us, where we can work on these issues and put aside some of the political consequences.”While Lummis made a number of notable points, the audience applauded her comment regarding Bitcoin’s use as an asset to interconnect with the U.S. dollar:Given Wyoming’s friendly stance toward Bitcoin, it was no surprise to also see Caitlin Long, CEO and founder of Avanti Financial Group — a Wyoming bank formed to bridge digital assets with the U.S. dollar payment system — speak at Bitcoin 2021. Long spoke on a panel entitled “Evolutions of Exchanges” and made a number of insightful points.For instance, when asked about centralization risks associated with exchanges, Long noted that the digital asset industry is making some of the same mistakes as traditional financial services:When asked about the ethos behind Avanti Financial, Long further remarked that “Satoshi gave us money that isn’t debt,” noting that Avanti is committed to solvency instead of liquidity. “A lot of folks are obsessed with liquidity, but Satoshi didn’t create anything designed to be leveraged and didn’t care about liquidity,” she said. Long additionally advised the audience to learn about circulation credit.The “Bitcoin for Billions, Not Billionaires” fireside chat featuring Elizabeth Stark, co-founder and CEO of Lightning Labs, and Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, was also interesting. The discussion focused on the importance of Bitcoin’s network effect, something which both Stark and Alden are very passionate about.Alden explained that Bitcoin’s network effect is important to understand when considering Bitcoin as an investment asset. The economist shared that, initially, she was wary of covering Bitcoin as an asset class due to its open-source nature, which could easily be replicated, along with its giant price run in 2017. However, after watching Bitcoin’s network effect over time, Alden noted that the digital assets could withstand its competitors while also maintaining its strong, devoted community. “Over time, my conviction kept growing and growing. By the time we had the early 2021 liquidity issue, that’s when I finally said ‘I’m in,’” she said.After monitoring Bitcoin’s network effect for some time, Alden noted that her fascination extended to the Lighting Network, a layer-two payment protocol. She explained that in some ways, the layer-two aspect is more reliant on the network effect than Bitcoin’s base layer since the key limitation of the second layer is liquidity:Another notable female speaker at Bitcoin 2021 was Hong Fang, CEO of OKCoin. Fang spoke on the “Giving Back to Bitcoin” panel, where she discussed how to prioritize investments in the Bitcoin space, who to invest in, and how to make the Bitcoin community scalable. “As to date, our investment in sponsoring the developers is up to $1 million, which is about $500,000 a year. To us, this is a significant amount of money, but when you think of the funding needs of developers, this is a small amount,” she said. As such, Fang noted that it’s important to keep Bitcoin developer funding diversified and flexible.An interesting point regarding Bitcoin and decentralization was further made by Alyse Killeen during the “Investing in the Bitcoin Ecosystem Panel.” Killeen told Cointelegraph that the panel mainly focused on the risks that can occur when money is centralized, such as inflation. With this in mind, she explained the importance of Bitcoin’s decentralization:To Killeen’s point, there are a number of rules associated with Bitcoin. Hailey Lennon, partner at Anderson Kill law firm, and Teana Baker-Taylor, general manager for Crypto.com U.K., made this clear during the “Bitcoin Makes the Laws” session.For example, Baker-Taylor explained how the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, relates to Bitcoin. Specifically, she explained the privacy issues brought about by the Travel Rule, which aims to require individual crypto users to provide information when sending or receiving Bitcoin across any blockchain network. “How are we supposed to record and store this information, and who is responsible for storing it? Several things have to be put in place to allow virtual asset service providers to be compliant with the Travel Rule,” she said.Lennon further touched on the topic of secondary market regulations, noting how great it is for companies to now have different licensing options:It’s also important to mention that there was one female artist featured at the event’s Bitcoin art gallery, which showcased an elaborate collection of Bitcoin-inspired artwork from various creators.Trew Love, a muralist and mixed media artist, told Cointelegraph that she was discovered by NFT Glee — a nonfungible token platform for artists and creators — and was curated within its collection by Evie Phillips, chief marketing officer of NFT Glee.Love noted that when she heard about the opportunity to join the NFT curation, she began to mint her collection. “I jumped on it and created an exclusive one-of-a-kind piece featuring Mike Tyson and a Bitcoin champion winning belt. I believe Bitcoin is the coin to rule it all,” she said.While a handful of female speakers discussed relevant topics on stage at Bitcoin 2021, notable female attendees had news to share with Cointelegraph.Vanessa Grellet, head of portfolio growth at CoinFund, told Cointelegraph that she plans to achieve two main goals moving forward. Grellet noted that CoinFund will take a multi-strategy approach to launch various vehicles related to different strategies such as NFTs, DeFi, farming and more. “We want to create specific vehicles for investors and to focus on those activities,” she commented. Secondly, Grellet explained that CoinFund will be expanding to become bi-coastal, including a location in Miami.Related: Women-led events may encourage long-term female participation in blockchainLisa Nestor, senior director of enterprise ecosystem for the Stellar Development Foundation, told Cointelegraph about a new partnership with Wyre, a blockchain payments company. Nestor noted that the Stellar Network is powering a new Wyre Savings API where fintechs can access yield-earning savings products leveraging USD Coin (USDC) on the Stellar blockchain.In addition to women discussing company growth and innovation, some ladies shed some insight on the quality of the conference. Mandy Campbell, head of content for OKCoin, told Cointelegraph that she had heard from a lot of inspiring women at Bitcoin 2021:Overall, while there were significantly fewer women speakers and attendees than men at Bitcoin 2021, the event was still high-level, informative and fun. Moving forward, though, the Bitcoin community may start to see more women participation at conferences as the topic gains momentum.For instance, Teodora Atanasova, VIP relations manager and founding team member at crypto-friendly bank Nexo, told Cointelegraph that Nexo sponsored the Bitcoin art gallery at Bitcoin 2021. Atanasova mentioned that she wasn’t previously aware that only one female artist was featured at the gallery.

566,"Bitcoin (BTC) logged its best daily performance on Wednesday since Feb. 8, the day Tesla announced that it had added $1.5 billion worth of BTC to its balance sheet.The flagship cryptocurrency surged 11.98% to $37,573 after El Salvador President Nayib Bukele passed legislation that approved it as a legal tender. In short, the Central American nation will now be able to price goods and services in BTC and will even accept the cryptocurrency for tax payments.Meanwhile, Bukele clarified that his government would not impose capital gains tax on Bitcoin investors. He also announced that El Salvador would use excessive volcano energy to mine the cryptocurrency, weeks after Tesla CEO Elon Musk ended its Bitcoin payment support over its alarming carbon footprints.I’ve just instructed the president of @LaGeoSV (our state-owned geothermal electric company), to put up a plan to offer facilities for #Bitcoin mining with very cheap, 100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions energy from our volcanos

This is going to evolve fast! pic.twitter.com/1316DV4YwTBut El Salvador's benchmark step to legitimizing Bitcoin as an upcoming store-of-value failed to generate bullish reactions from ""smart"" investors, according to Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Fund, a Singapore-based crypto investment fund.The chartered financial analyst said that Wednesday's upside sentiments in the Bitcoin market remained weak even after the El Salvador news. The popular Fear & Greed Index pointed towards ""extreme fear,"" while contracts of Bitcoin derivatives from smart money were net short during the BTC/USD's 11.98% rally.Trading activity also looked frail, noted Neo, adding:Ben Lilly, an analyst at Jarvis Labs, provided further anecdotes on why bearish continuation remains a real risk even as Bitcoin posts its best daily candles in months. He flashed at the latest spike in BTCUSD Shorts, a dataset that records the number of margined short positions on Bitfinex exchange, on the same day the pair rallied in spot markets.Dramatic escalation in BTCUSD Shorts typically leads to declines in the Bitcoin spot rates. Conversely, a crashing BTCUSD Shorts signals an imminent price rally.Meanwhile, Lilly also brought back ""Pablo"" into his bearish analogy.The analyst conceived the make-believe character last year to refer to a Bitcoin wallet owner that, according to him, played a major role in dumping and pumping BTC/USD markets on various occasions, including March 2020 crash.Lilly warned that the anonymous trader still sits atop a Bitcoin stash that he might dump later. He added:The CVD indicator added to the Bitcoin market's bearish bias. The indicator, shared by Lilly, implied a spike in Bitcoin selling orders having volumes between $100,000 and $10M.Lily said that market movers are not behind the El Salvador Bitcoin price pump, noting that ""they are letting price move about unencumbered.""Meanwhile, Bitcoin Dominance Index, a gauge to measure the benchmark cryptocurrency's strength against its rival cryptos, surged from 41.28% to 44.23%.The move uphill suggested that traders offloaded their altcoin positions to seek opportunities in the Bitcoin market, especially as the cryptocurrency became an official legal tender in El Salvador."
567,"Institutional investors have been showing a stronger appetite for a carbon-neutral Bitcoin (BTC) investment solution by One River Digital Asset Management.One River Digital, a crypto-focused hedge fund offering exposure to Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), announced Wednesday that an overwhelming majority of assets in its institutional Bitcoin fund have chosen to switch to One River’s new carbon-neutrality share class.In April, the company introduced a new system that calculates the carbon cost of Bitcoin mining and buys tokenized carbon credits in order to offset the environmental impact. Based on the estimated carbon emitted per one BTC and the market price of the offset required to neutralize that emission, the carbon cost of mining one BTC is equivalent to $55 per year, or 0.15% of the cost of one BTC. One River buys these tokenized carbon credits, validating them on a blockchain.One River Digital president Sebastian Bea told Cointelegraph that over 75% of assets in the company's Bitcoin private fund have committed to shift to its carbon-neutral share class. ""We estimate carbon emissions based on the electricity consumption of Bitcoin miners and average production for their location. Carbon offset tokens are immediately retired to the Ethereum protocol, the carbon credits are extinguished,"" he explained.Bea went on to say that the growing number of institutional clients moving into One River’s carbon-neutral BTC investing could be a signal of a wider investment trend. “We believe it is reflective of a broader shift in investor preferences, as transparency mounts across institutional portfolios. We look forward to further opportunities as the digital asset ecosystem seeks a 100% carbon-neutral future,” he noted.The latest news comes shortly after One River Digital filed for a carbon-neutral Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in late May. The carbon-neutral BTC ETF is designed to reflect the performance of Bitcoin on a “carbon-neutral basis” that is to offset the carbon footprint by purchasing and retiring carbon credits to cover emissions associated with Bitcoin in the trust.One River’s carbon-neutral BTC investment tools come amid growing debate over the carbon impact of Bitcoin mining, with Tesla suspending BTC payments for its cars due to associated environmental concerns costs month. Major Bitcoin proponents like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor believe that Bitcoin mining is the highest value use of renewable energy as well as the highest use of wasted or stranded energy. According to Blockcap data, Bitcoin was using less than 0.1% of human energy production worldwide as of May 2021.Disclaimer: This article was updated to specify that over 75% of assets in the One River Digital's Bitcoin private fund have committed to shift to its carbon neutral share class."
568,"The tide may have finally turned for cryptocurrencies in India as reports indicate a softer stance by the government toward crypto.According to a report by The New Indian Express on Thursday, the government’s hostile stance toward Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be shifting toward more common-sense regulatory policies for cryptocurrencies.According to inside sources quoted by the publication, authorities have dropped earlier plans for a blanket Bitcoin ban in favor of classifying cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class.The Securities and Exchange Board of India will reportedly be tasked with overseeing crypto regulations in the country in collaboration with the finance ministry.These inside sources also claim that Parliament will debate a comprehensive crypto regulatory bill during the Monsoon Session beginning in July. An expert panel created by the finance ministry is reportedly studying protocols for crypto regulation and its finding could form part of the parliamentary deliberations next month.Commenting on the emerging positive signals on the crypto regulatory front, Ketan Surana, a member of the Internet and Mobile Association of India said:Back in May, Indiatech.org, a technology lobby group in India, urged the government to define crypto as digital assets and not currencies.Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India remains a staunch crypto critic, with the central bank recently stating that its position on cryptocurrencies remains unchanged. However, the RBI has distanced itself from reports that it mandated banks to block services to crypto exchanges.Indeed, India’s Supreme Court overturned in March 2020 a 2018 RBI ban that prohibited banks from servicing cryptocurrency exchanges. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, three major crypto exchanges — Kraken, Bitfinex and KuCoin — are looking to enter the Indian market."
569,"JPMorgan’s cryptocurrency market analysts have pointed to the difference between Bitcoin’s (BTC) spot prices and BTC futures prices as a potential bearish sign for the market.In a Thursday note to clients, JPMorgan analysts led by global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote that the Bitcoin market has returned to backwardation — a situation when the spot price is above futures prices. The analysts said that the past month’s correction in crypto markets saw Bitcoin futures reversing into backwardation for the first time since 2018.According to the strategists, Bitcoin futures backwardation should be viewed as a negative sign for BTC price despite a major rebound on the market over the past two days, with Bitcoin hitting $37,500 on Thursday. The analysts stressed that the Bitcoin futures curve was in backwardation for most of 2018, a year when Bitcoin dropped 74% after hitting its then-historic high of $20,000 in late 2017:In the latest analysis, JPMorgan specifically looked at a 21-day moving average of the second Bitcoin futures spread over spot prices. The analysts observed an “unusual development and a reflection of how weak Bitcoin demand is at the moment from institutional investors” who trade futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The analysts also noted that Bitcoin’s weakened share in the total crypto market value is another concerning trend. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin dominance on crypto markets tanked to 40% in late May, marking the lowest share over the past three years after surging above 70% this January.At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s share in the total crypto market capitalization is 43%, accounting for $682 billion out of the total crypto market value of $1.6 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Some analysts like crypto index provider Stack Funds believe that BTC dominance could retest its previous highs in the short term."
570,"Bitcoin (BTC) neared $38,000 in a strong comeback on Thursday, but forecasts are mounting over an imminent retracement.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting local highs of $37,500 overnight on Wednesday, maintaining higher levels since.Versus its lows at the start of the week, the pair was up over 20% at the high.However, despite its gains, few traders believe that Bitcoin will stay strong for long. As Cointelegraph reported, demands for a dip below $30,000 support have remained in play throughout recent days.According to popular Twitter account Crypto Tony, Thursday will mark the day that the cooldown takes hold. He had previously mapped out a possible dip to around $27,000 in line with various other predictions.“So will today be the day we get that wave 2 drop or the C wave drop on Bitcoin,” he wrote in his latest update.Fellow trader Crypto Cobra, meanwhile, demands a broad 20% correction for the entire crypto market capitalization, something of which he remains convinced, provided that BTC/USD is below $42,000.Others were less brazen with their projections. Analyzing the four-hour chart on Thursday, Crypto Ed considered a bounce level nearer $32,000 should another leg down be necessary.“Not really clear this morning, hard to find the pieces of the puzzles and I could be totally wrong, hence only a 4hr chart,” he explained.Good news from multiple sources has buoyed the Bitcoin narrative in particular in recent days. El Salvador’s adoption announcement seemed to have a latent impact on markets, while on Wednesday, $157-billion asset manager Victory Capital joined the crypto bandwagon."
571,"Sovryn, a Bitcoin (BTC) money market protocol built on Bitcoin-based smart contract platform RSK, recently appeared to be shooting up through the decentralized finance rankings.On Wednesday, Bitcoin commentator Anthony Pompliano shared data to his 1 million followers from decentralized finance data aggregator DefiLlama, indicating the protocol had amassed a total value locked (TVL) of $1.95 billion — ranking it 14th for the sector and beating out DeFi darling Uniswap v3.Sovryn has a higher TVL than Uniswap V3.

I keep telling everyone that DeFi infrastructure on Bitcoin is the most mispriced opportunity in the market.

Proceed as you wish https://t.co/YZpcSrXW9DPompliano and many of his followers are aggrieved that Ethereum-focused platforms, such as DeFi Pulse, do not list Bitcoin DeFi projects like Sovryn and Stacks, with the influencer stating:Pompliano’s post about Sovryn has garnered criticism from Ethereum ecosystem proponents who refuted the idea that Sovryn had amassed a ten-figure TVL. “ChainLinkGod” suggested staked governance tokens may have contributed to an exaggerated TVL estimate.How is the market price of staked $SOV determined? I can't find any info on the token pricehttps://t.co/T5ILAtYUizSince Pompliano’s original post, DefiLlama has adjusted its data for Sovryn, now listing the project as having a TVL of just $52 million. The updated data now matches the TVL provided by Sovryn’s own Wiki.In a Thursday statement, DefiLlama confirmed that its previous estimate of Sovryn’s TVL was nearly $2 billion and had indeed resulted from including the capitalization of staked assets. The data aggregator added that it will soon issue an update to its website allowing users to choose whether or not staked assets are included in TVL data.Regarding the recent controversy on Sovryn:
1. We've removed staking from their TVL
2. We'll issue an update to the site that allows anyone to choose whether they want staking to be included or excluded on TVL
3. We'll re-add sovryn staking after the updateSince decentralized finance exploded in popularity during 2020, TVL has emerged as the dominant metric by which a protocol’s success is measured. However, many analysts have argued that TVL is reductionistic and should not be treated as the sole measure of a DeFi project’s progress.Speaking to Cointelegraph, CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong stated that much like how market capitalization has become the primary measure of a token or coin’s success, TVL has risen in popularity due to its simplicity, emphasizing the convenience of establishing “one number to compare against all DeFi protocols.”“It’s not the perfect measure [...], but it is the most straightforward measure for people to understand and use as a benchmark,” he added.Ong believes that total trading volume should be the primary metric that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are measured by, noting that volume “drives protocol revenue.” For the same reason, he argued that borrowing volume should be the principal measure of money market protocols.Ong also recommended that analysts place a greater emphasis on combining TVL with other key metrics to illustrate the capital efficiency of liquidity locked in a given protocol:Ong also argued that dividing a project’s TVL by its market capitalization or fully diluted valuation (FDV) is useful for comparing DeFi protocols operating in the same segment."
572,"Seattle-based mining software company Luxor has closed a Series A funding round led by institutional Bitcoin technology and financial services firm NYDIG.Luxor announced the $5 million funding round on June 9, adding that NYDIG will collaborate with Luxor on a number of mining-related ventures and hashrate-based products.Also participating in the equity round were mining companies Blockware Solutions, Celsius Network, DPO, Navier, and Supplybit. A number of angel investors along with Bitnomial, Hodl Capital, and Routemaster also participated.According to the announcement, Luxor and NYDIG aim to help grow the North American mining industry with Luxor working on making hashrate a commodity, and NYDIG providing Bitcoin investment and technology solutions to insurers, banks, corporations, and institutions.Luxor provides a software solution called Switch that employs a profit-switching algorithm designed to maximize earnings by switching between blockchains and venues to capitalize on the best block rewards. Nick Hansen, CEO, and co-founder of Luxor, commented:The announcement comes as China continues to crack down on crypto mining operations and U.S. lawmakers grow increasingly agitated over Bitcoin payments for ransomware attacks.As reported by Cointelegraph, China’s dominance over hashrate is dwindling while America's is increasing as mining operations can tap into an abundance of cheap renewable energy in states such as Texas.Robert Gutmann, co-founder and CEO of NYDIG, stated:On June 4, Cointelegraph reported that a number of Chinese mining operations were closing up shop on the mainland and seeking international expansion."
573,"A 21st-century space race appears to be brewing between Elon Musk and BitMEX, with both parties pledging to launch their respective crypto of choice to the literal moon first.On Friday, popular crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX announced it would be supporting space robotics firm Astrobotic Technology in the company’s mission to send its first commercial lander to the moon during Q4 2020.Noting that the mission aims to be the first instance in which “a private company leading a coalition of government, academia, industry, and international partners reaches the lunar surface,” BitMEX plans to make the occasion by delivering a one-of-a-kind physical Bitcoin (BTC) to the moon’s surface. Referring to Musk as a “Dogecoin protagonist,” BitMEX added:The announcement followed Musk’s early May news that SpaceX is planning to launch a Dogecoin-funded payload on one of its first rockets to the moon, asserting that Dogecoin (DOGE) would become the first cryptocurrency to reach lunar orbit next year.Musk responded to BitMEX’s newfound astronomic ambitions on Twitter, proclaiming: “A new space race has begun!”While replies to Elon’s tweet are largely his followers barracking for DOGE to win the crypto space race, others noted there are more pressing problems on Earth than whether one’s crypto token of choice is the first to enter the orbit of another celestial body.Can we take care of the problems here on Earth before we thrust ourselves into space, while homeless people sleep in the streets and the middle class struggles to get by?
Wtf is wrong with you? Look aroundWhile few projects exploring the utility of establishing crypto infrastructure from space have captured the mainstream imagination like Musk’s Dogecoin expedition has, the Tesla CEO’s plans to take cryptocurrency out of this world are not the first.Blockstream appears to have been the first in pioneering the use of crypto satellites, launching satellites to broadcast Bitcoin transactions from space in August 2017.In August 2020, Robonomics and Kusama announced an ambitious plan to develop “an interplanetary architecture” capable of relaying data between Mars and Earth using the Kusama network.CryptoSat outlined the concept behind its ambitious plan to launch a nano-satellite the size of a coffee mug into space in a November 2017 white paper, with the satellite slated to operate as an isolated cryptographic module from orbit. The team plans to prove the concept with a launch this year before sending an entire constellation of CryptoSats into orbit later on.Spacechain similarly launched in 2017 and has successfully deployed nodes in orbit. On June 3, 2021, the project announced that its multisig Ethereum payload destined for installation on the International Space Station had been launched aboard a SpaceX rocket."
574,"The cryptocurrency market flashed bullish on Wednesday as Bitcoin’s (BTC) price reversed course and rallied 20% to $37,500. For the past few weeks, analysts have been debating whether or not BTC was entering a long-term bear trend, and the argument has been further complicated by a mixture of positive and negative headlines, including the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador and authorities in China ordering Chinese search engines to block results for searches related to the top crypto exchanges in the country. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin has surged 20% from a low at $31,000 late on Tuesday to an intraday high at $37,450 as bulls look to take control of the trend.The move higher is seen as a bullish development for many including Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, who now feels that BTC is more likely to reach $40,000 than collapse down to $20,000. On the other hand, traders such as Rekt Capital believe that BTC needs to have a weekly close above $32,000 to avoid further downside. #BTC is now at Weekly support (black; ~$32000)

Wicking into the orange area (~$29000) is fine as long as $BTC can Weekly Close above the black level later this week#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/iDtjHdphKjThe steady flow of positive announcements combined with the renewed regulatory crackdown in China has led some traders to ponder whether a bullish reversal is at hand or if the current price action is nothing more than a bull trap. According to Delphi Digital, the clear head-and-shoulders pattern seen on the BTC chart is a potential bearish indicator. Despite this bearish pattern, the analysts also noted that a bullish RSI divergence has also formed, indicating the possibility of a trend reversal in the near future.According to Élie Le Rest, partner at digital asset management firm ExoAlpha, “the thesis for Bitcoin as a store of value is stronger than ever,” but he feels that the top cryptocurrency “needs to increase its dominance” in order for the current bull run to continue.Le Rest pointed to the news of El Salvador recognizing BTC as legal tender as “a huge step forward toward Bitcoin adoption,” and he expects other countries to follow suit in the coming months and years.Regarding Bitcoin’s future prospects, Le Rest mentioned that following the lower level retest of the $30,000–$40,000 range over the past few days, a break above $40,000 “could resume the bull run that took place a month ago.”Le Rest said:Traders have also been keeping a close eye on Ether (ETH), and Le Rest pointed to the “massive ETH outflow” seen on Tuesday as “a positive sign that the ETH bull run is not over yet,” but he cautioned that alternative chains like the Binance Smart Chain, Solana and Avalanche “are putting a lot of efforts to take their DeFi market share.”Bitcoin’s rally to $37,500 also provided a boost to many altcoins. Ether saw its price rally 14% from a low at $2,300 on Tuesday to an intraday high near $2,630, and Delphi Digital pointed out that the price of Ether is being supported by a decline in the circulating supply of Ether, as 23% of its supply is now locked up smart contracts.Other notable performances include a 23% gain in the price of Kusama (KSM) to an intraday high at $486 following the launch of the Kusama parachain auctions and an 18% gain in the price of the Curve DAO Token (CRV) to $2.50.The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.63 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 43%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

575,"Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is more likely to rally to $40,000 than slump to $20,000. This bullish outlook seems to be shared by traders as Bitcoin initiated a sharp recovery today.On-chain data also suggests that long-term holders (LTH) have again started accumulating Bitcoin after booking profits during the rally from $10,000 to $64,000.The total number of Bitcoin held by these long-term holders is 2.3 million more than what they held at the peak of the 2017 bull market. This shows the veteran traders remain bullish about the future prospects of Bitcoin.CoinShares' Monday “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly” report shows institutional investors pulled out $141 million from Bitcoin investment products last week. However, Ether (ETH), XRP and Cardano (ADA) products witnessed net inflows, suggesting money is exiting Bitcoin and entering select altcoins.However, the outflow from Bitcoin products is minuscule compared to the massive $4.2 billion that was pumped into them in 2021. This shows that most investors have held their positions despite the recent fall.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine whether the correction is over or if the prices could fall further.Bitcoin broke below the trendline of the symmetrical triangle on June 7, indicating the uncertainty resolved in favor of the bears. However, the long tail on the June 8 candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels.The bulls continued their purchase today, which seems to have trapped the aggressive bears who may have sold on June 7. However, the BTC/USDT pair is still not out of the woods yet because the relief rally is likely to face resistance at the 20-day exponential moving average ($37,925).If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The next leg of the downtrend could begin after the bears sink the price below the $31,000 to $28,000 support zone. Such a move may open the doors for a decline to $20,000.However, the relative strength index (RSI) has formed a bullish divergence, indicating the bearish momentum is weakening. The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close above the 20-day EMA, which could extend the relief rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($45,896).Ether once again turned down from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on June 7, indicating the bears are aggressively defending the zone between the resistance line and the 50-day SMA ($2,927).However, the long tail on the June 8 candlestick shows the bulls are buying on dips to the support line of the symmetrical triangle. This suggests the ETH/USDT pair could remain stuck inside the triangle for a few more days.The next trending move could start after the price breaks above or below the triangle. The buyers will have to propel the price above the 50-day SMA to gain the upper hand. Alternatively, a break below $2,079.94 could signal advantage to the bears.Binance Coin (BNB) broke below the trendline on June 8 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. The long tail on the daily candlestick suggests that bulls are attempting to defend the trendline.If buyers push the price above the 20-day EMA ($389), the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $433. A breakout and close above this level will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective at $608.60.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the trendline, it will suggest that bears have overpowered the bulls. That could result in a drop to $257.40 and then to $211.70.Cardano dropped below the 50-day SMA ($1.57) on June 8 but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. The long tail on the June 8 and June 9 candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels.The flattish moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This balance will shift in favor of the bears if the price breaks below the trendline. The ADA/USDT pair could then drop to $1.24 and then to $1.On the contrary, if the buyers propel the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.64), the pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $1.94. A breakout and close above this level could push the pair to the all-time high at $2.47.Dogecoin (DOGE) broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.36) on June 7 and fell to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. The bulls are trying to defend this level as seen from the long tail on the June 8 candlestick and the strong rebound today.However, unless the bulls push the price above the moving averages quickly, the bears will once again try to sink the DOGE/USDT pair below the neckline. If they succeed, the pair could decline to $0.21 and then to $0.10.The marginally downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls drive the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.39). The pair could then move up to $0.47.XRP broke below the $0.88 support on June 7, suggesting supply exceeds demand. However, the long tail on the June 8 candlestick indicates that bulls are trying to defend the $0.75 to $0.65 support zone.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.99) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that bears are in control. The relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, the possibility of a break below the support zone increases.If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to $0.45 and then to $0.39. Conversely, if the bulls push the price above $1.10, it will suggest the buyers are back in the game and a rally to the downtrend line is possible.Polkadot (DOT) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($24.99) on June 7 and broke below the trendline of the ascending channel. This suggests that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies.If the bulls fail to push the price back into the channel within the next few days, further selling could be expected. The gradually downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the downside.If the DOT/USDT pair breaks below $19.60, the next stop could be the critical support at $15. Conversely, if the pair re-enters the channel, it will suggest strong accumulation at lower levels.A breakout and close above the resistance line of the ascending channel will signal that bulls are back in the game.Uniswap (UNI) dipped below the $21.50 support on June 8 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. The long tail on the day’s candlestick shows the bulls are defending the $21.50 level aggressively.The buyers will now try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($26.81). If they succeed, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to the overhead resistance at $30. This level may act as a stiff resistance and if the price turns down from it, the pair could remain range-bound between $21.50 and $30 for a few days.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment is negative and traders are selling on every minor rally. That will increase the possibility of a break below $21.50. If that happens, the pair could start its journey toward $16.49 and then $13.04.Solana (SOL) turned down from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $43.38 on June 7 but the bears could not pull the price below the trendline. The altcoin rebounded off the trendline on June 8, indicating strong buying on dips.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If buyers thrust and sustain the price above $43.38, the SOL/USDT pair could move up to the 78.6% retracement level at $49.97. Such a move will suggest the recent correction is over. A break above $49.97 could clear the path for a retest of the all-time high at $58.38.This positive view will nullify if the price turns down and plummets below the trendline. A break below $33.60 could result in a decline to $25.70.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke below the $616.04 support on June 7, suggesting the bears are in command. However, the long tail on the June 8 candlestick indicates that bulls are trying to defend the $500 to $468.13 support zone.If the bulls can sustain the price above $616.04, the BCH/USDT pair could make one more attempt to rise above the downtrend line. If that happens, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($917).On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level or the downtrend line, then the bears may challenge the critical $468.13 support. A break below this level could extend the decline to the next support at $400.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

576,"On June 7, the United States government task force seized more than $2 million in Bitcoin (BTC) to pay a ransom following an attack on the Colonial Pipeline system. A warrant filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California shows that authorities recovered 63.7 BTC.As news of the recovery spread through mainstream media, some outlets suggested that the U.S. government somehow hacked the Bitcoin address in order to extract the funds. For example, University of Michigan professor and New York Times contributor Justin Wolfers tweeted:News that the government has figured out how to snatch bitcoin from the online wallets of cyber criminals surely reduces the use cases for Bitcoin even further.This triggered a discussion on whether an entity could break through SHA-256 encryption, and if so, why waste this ability on unlocking a Bitcoin wallet that only contains $2 million?The same type of cryptography is used by the National Security Agency, banks, foreign agencies, cloud storage systems, and most electronic devices like smartphones and communication apps.If governments wanted to create short-term havoc in the cryptocurrency market, they would need to make large sales to negatively impact the price. However, there would probably be at least 3 telling signs that would hint that this type of scenario was unfolding.The most likely vehicle for government entities to short (sell) is by trading CME Bitcoin futures. In addition to the price pressure, analysts would need to confirm a large increase in open interest, which is the number of contracts in play. Unfortunately, CME does not provide real-time data for this indicator.As shown above, each CME Bitcoin futures contract represents 5 BTC, so the 7,572 open interest totals 37,860 BTC. These contracts are financially settled, meaning that the winner is paid in dollars.While the current $1.25 billion open interest does not seem significant enough to create shockwaves, the figure did reach $3.3 billion in February as Bitcoin traded at $58,000. Therefore, a substantial and rapid increase in the open interest is a potential indicator of government-related activity.A large futures contract seller will cause a momentary distortion in the futures premium. Unlike perpetual contracts, these fixed-calendar futures do not have a funding rate, so their price will vastly differ from regular spot exchanges.By measuring the price gap between futures and the regular spot market, a trader can gauge the level of bullishness in the market. Whenever there's an aggressive activity from shorts (sellers), the two-month futures contract will trade at a 1% or higher discount.Notice how the July CME futures usually trade between a 0.5% discount and a 1.5% premium versus regular spot exchanges. However, during the May 19 crash, aggressive futures contracts selling caused the price to trade 2.5% below Coinbase.This movement can either occur during liquidation orders or when large players decide to short the market using derivatives.Even though most cryptocurrency exchanges have established their servers in remote locations, governments could try to seize physical servers or web domains.Investors who have been following the crypto sector since 2017 will remember that Alex Vinnik, the founder of BTC-e, was arrested and the website hijacked by the U.S. government in July 2017.In November 2020, Cointelegraph published an excellent article that explained how, according to a framework from the U.S. Department of Justice, it could be enough for a crypto transaction to ""touch financial, data storage, or other computer systems within the United States"" to provoke enforcement action.Any coordinated effort by governments to suppress cryptocurrencies will likely involve a massive ""anti-money laundering"" effort against exchanges, especially those offering derivatives products to retail investors.Thus, unless these 3 signs are in place, there is little reason to believe that a massive government-led campaign to disrupt the industry is underway.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

577,"Bitcoin (BTC) price reclaimed $36,000 heading into the New York session Wednesday as investors awaited fresh data on inflation in May and El Salvador approved a bill that made cryptocurrencies a legal tender in the country.The benchmark cryptocurrency surged 9.86% to an intraday high of $36,696, wiping off a portion of the losses it incurred in the previous session. In retrospect, the BTC/USD exchange rate had fallen to almost $31,000 on Tuesday over fears that the pair has entered a 2018-like bearish phase after topping out near $65,000 in mid-April.#Bitcoin on the charts: Key levels to watch come in at $30,000 and $47,000. Below $30,000 opens possibility for deeper setback towards the previous record high from late 2017 around $20,000. Back above $47,000 will put the focus back on the current record high. $BTCUSD #crypto pic.twitter.com/X6d23G0FiHOn the other hand, bulls kept projecting Bitcoin as a primary tool against inflation, with Mike McGlone, the senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, noting that the cryptocurrency's possibility to reach $40,000 in the coming sessions is higher than reaching $20,000. He said:Bitcoin received further upside boost from El Salvador. The Central American country, under the leadership of its president Nayib Bukele, became the first nation to approve Bitcoin as its legal tender.The law will take effect in 90 days, enabling Salvadorans to use Bitcoin for paying and accepting goods and services. They will also be able to pay taxes in cryptocurrency.Bukele also announced that El Salvador would use the country's ""volcano energy"" to mine Bitcoin. The announcement served as a response to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's Bitcoin payment suspension announcement over environmental concerns. Musk's decision led to a severe FUD among investors that caused a massive crash in the cryptocurrency market.Elon never anticipated his #Bitcoin energy FUD would be met with the Volcano energy hammer.Bitcoin's latest move uphill also emerged out of technical supports. At around $31,000, traders expressed a short-term bullish conviction because of the cryptocurrency's ability to hold $30,000 as support in the recent history.For instance, on May 19, Bitcoin jumped by more than 40% overnight after testing $30,000 as a price floor.Yuriy Mazur, head of the data analysis department at CEX.IO Broker, noted that BTC/USD could hold levels around $30,000 as support despite the latest setback. The senior analyst cited higher inflation behind his bullish analogy. He told Cointelegraph:The statements appeared despite concerns that the Federal Reserve would eventually hike interest rates to bring inflation to its preferred target of 2%. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen further clarified in her interview with Bloomberg that higher interest rates would be a plus.A higher rate tends to sap investors' appetite for hedging assets like Bitcoin and gold.But, according to Yuriy, a rate hike would not hurt Bitcoin's demand among investors, noting that expensive lending would reverse gains across the U.S. stock market indexes. He added:The U.S. CPI data will be released on Thursday."
578,"As is par for the course for Bitcoin (BTC), El Salvador becoming the first nation-state to adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender is now immortalized on the blockchain.Data from blockchain explorer service Blockchair shows block 686,938 bearing the message “asamblea aprueba la ley bitcoin” — meaning ""assembly approves Bitcoin law"" — which is the front-page headline carried by El Salvadoran daily Diario El Salvador on Wednesday.Esta es la portada de #DiarioElSalvador de este miércoles 9 de junio del 2021. #DiarioES #DES pic.twitter.com/D2tgNG2TPKPoolin, the third-largest Bitcoin mining pool by hash rate, was responsible for mining the transaction block that contained the message.This El Salvador headline announcing #Bitcoin has become legal tender, was just embedded into the blockchain. It will now remain there for all of eternity. pic.twitter.com/DtHiFDB4XMAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, El Salvador’s legislature passed a bill to make Bitcoin legal tender in the country. Meanwhile, a wave of support for BTC among key government figures in Latin America continues to emerge to the excitement of several Bitcoin proponents.Reacting to the growing trend, Chris Burniske, partner at blockchain-focused venture capital fund Placeholder VC, tweeted that move could be a means for Latin American nations to “strike back at dollars and debt.”Earlier this week, former United States President Donald Trump doubled down on his Bitcoin stance, stating that BTC was competing with the U.S. dollar.Poolin’s commemoration of El Salvador’s historic Bitcoin legalization move comes over a decade after BTC creator Satoshi Nakamoto etched The Times' front-page headline from Jan. 3, 2009, on the blockchain's genesis block:A few blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain also contain messages and other references meant to memorialize certain occasions.When block height 666,666 came around back in January, the “winning miner” included a verse from the Bible: “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good - Romans 12:21.”In April, Coinbase had Bitcoin mining pool F2Pool embed a New York Times article in block 679,187."
579,"United States foreign exchange company Interactive Brokers will offer direct cryptocurrency trading to clients within months, a report says.Speaking at the Piper Sandler Global Exchange & FinTech Conference on Wednesday, founder Thomas Peterffy revealed that the firm had opted to enter the crypto market.Quoted by CNBC, Peterffy hinted that client demand had been a major driver of the decision.“Customers certainly are asking for [crypto trading] and we expect to be ready to offer it to them by the end of the summer,” he said. Interactive Brokers offers traders a wide variety of assets in addition to currencies, including stocks, options, futures, bonds and funds, according to its website. As of 2019, its equity value totaled almost $8 billion.The move into crypto will presumably feature Bitcoin (BTC) first and foremost, with Peterffy nonetheless not naming specific tokens.“As for hurdles, the greatest hurdle is how do you keep you customers 100% safe,” CNBC additionally quoted him as saying.The announcement coincides with the latest chapter in Bitcoin's evolution into a mainstream asset class courtesy of El Salvador's pioneering legal tender move.As Cointelegraph reported, a senior Bloomberg analyst said Wednesday that Bitcoin is no longer ""speculative"" in nature.Despite seeing considerable selling pressure in recent weeks, BTC/USD is more likely to next hit $40,000 than $20,000, Mike McGlone of Bloomberg Intelligence added.The pair is up 6% on Wednesday after bouncing from $31,000 earlier in the week."
580,"Bitcoin (BTC) is “more likely” to hit $40,000 than $20,000, Bloomberg argues, as the largest cryptocurrency gains 6% in a day.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reclaiming the $35,000 mark amid new bullish forecasts from analysts.In a tweet on Wednesday, Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, argued that Bitcoin would sooner see a return to $40,000 than its 2017 all-time highs of $20,000.“Bitcoin Capitulation? $40,000 Appears More Likely Than $20,000,” he wrote.McGlone highlighted Bitcoin meeting its 20-week moving average as providing similar bottom signals to March 2020 — the height of the coronavirus-induced market crash.Moving averages continue to play a key part in concerns over where the BTC price is headed next.Bitcoin has been gaining on the back of news that El Salvador will be the first country in history to make it legal tender.The move is a major counterpoint to the sea of “bad news” triggers that have come from various sources in recent days and weeks, including former United States President Donald Trump calling it a “scam.”As Cointelegraph reported, many market participants still favor a return to bearish price action, such as a further retest of $30,000 or even lower.#BTC update
0.5fib level from the latest leg down is crucial imo.
Current bounce could be corrective to that 0.5fib level and down from there again.
In case the ABC turns into a 1-5, it is opening the gates for more upside towards $42k pic.twitter.com/VweyziWnwyFor McGlone, however, the El Salvador announcement, which first surfaced at last week’s Miami conference, marks an unequivocal turning point.“Woodstock-Like Bitcoin 2021 Miami Backs Mainstream-Adoption View: The June 3–5 Bitcoin 2021 conference further validated our view that Bitcoin has transitioned to a global digital-reserve asset and away from being a speculative crypto,” he tweeted on Tuesday.At the time of writing, BTC/USD circled $35,000 still while so far not turning the level into reliable support. "
581,"Software firm MicroStrategy saw $1.6 billion worth of orders in a recent junk bond offering — four times the initially sought amount.Earlier this week, the company announced it would issue $400 million worth of junk bonds in a private offering, with a view to using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin (BTC). Junk bonds are debt offerings by companies without investment-grade credit ratings and typically offer investors higher returns while carrying higher risk. Returns between 6.125% and 6.25% have been floated for the bonds, eclipsing the returns offered by treasury bonds.“The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by MicroStrategy Services Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of MicroStrategy, and certain subsidiaries of MicroStrategy that may be formed or acquired after the closing of the offering,” stated MicroStrategy’s announcement.One day later, the firm announced it would increase its bond offering to $500 million, after which it was inundated with $1.6 billion worth of orders.MicroStrategy currently holds the most Bitcoin on its balance sheet out of all publicly traded companies, amounting to a dollar valuation of around $3.2 billion — more than twice the value of Bitcoin held by Tesla ($1.4 billion).MicroStrategy’s stock price soared throughout much of 2020 and 2021 in line with the rising price of Bitcoin. But holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet wasn’t enough to stop MicroStrategy’s stock slide, which eventually came when the cryptocurrency market dipped. Since Bitcoin peaked in early April, the MicroStrategy share price has sunk by 45%.MicroStrategy also revealed the formation of a new subsidiary to hold its existing 92,079 Bitcoins, dubbed MacroStrategy LLC.Reaction to the news on social media was typically varied. Bitcoin supporters celebrated the news, noting the massive excess in demand for MicroStrategy’s bonds.Crypto skeptic Peter Schiff questioned the wisdom of purchasing an asset that has been historically volatile. Schiff asked how a sudden drop in the price of Bitcoin would affect MicroStrategy’s business operations.Let’s wait and see."
582,"United Kingdom-based fund manager Ruffer liquidated its $600-million Bitcoin (BTC) bet after growing nervous about the speculative frenzy in the cryptocurrency market, including huge rallies in meme-based tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE).The fund, which manages roughly $34 billion for wealthy clients and charities, started selling its cryptocurrency stash in December 2020, when the BTC/USD exchange rate rose to $25,000, the Sunday Times reported.It continued selling as the pair established newer highs in January 2021, breaking past the $40,000 level. Ruffer had wound up its remaining Bitcoin position by April, netting $1.1 billion in profits from the sales, or an 83% return for the fund.Ruffer’s sequential Bitcoin dumps appeared in moments that saw analysts predicting greater valuations for the flagship cryptocurrency. For instance, JPMorgan said in a report published in January that BTC/USD could rise to $146,000 as it competes with gold to become the world’s leading inflationary hedge.Guggenheim Partners chief investment officer Scott Minerd also called for a $400,000–$600,000 Bitcoin, believing that the cryptocurrency would be able to mousetrap gold’s market in the long run.Ruffer clarified that it would consider repurchasing Bitcoin as an insurance against inflation, with its investment director Duncan MacInnes telling the Financial Times that it would be assessing the markets “from the sidelines than from in the trenches.”But for now, MacInnes agreed, Bitcoin is too hot to hold especially when Dogecoin, a joke-based cryptocurrency, is valued at $40 billion. He said:Dogecoin, a satirical homage to Bitcoin, underwent a wild upside rally in 2021 as it rose 15,337% year-to-date at one point in time.Supportive tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as some of the leading catalysts behind the Dogecoin price rally, including reshared July 2020 meme showing the cryptocurrency storming the global financial system.It’s inevitable pic.twitter.com/eBKnQm6QyFBut the retail frenzy started dying in May after Musk called Dogecoin a “hustle” on a Saturday Night Live episode. The billionaire entrepreneur’s U-turn on the token caused panic selling across the cryptocurrency market, hinting that loss-making traders attempted to cash out gains from still-profitable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.Dogecoin fell 30% instantly after Musk’s statement. As of Wednesday, the cryptocurrency was trading more than 50% lower than its all-time high of $0.76.“You could see very clearly that there was a rise in speculative behavior,” said MacInnes while pointing at Bitcoin’s own rise from $30,000 to almost $65,000 amid the Dogecoin retail frenzy. Nevertheless, he added that at least the benchmark cryptocurrency’s boom had some rationality behind it.Lower-yielding bonds and devaluated fiat currencies left investors without a better traditional safe-haven asset. As a result, their traditional 60/40 portfolio strategy returned nothing, which led them to “new safe-haven, uncorrelated assets” like Bitcoin.Ruffer has shifted its funds to Bitcoin-rivaling anti-inflation assets, including gold, inflation-protected bonds and commodity stocks. The firm asserted that it would keep the cryptocurrency “on the menu” for the future."
583,"China’s stance toward decentralized cryptocurrency trading appears to be getting even tougher. Chinese journalist Colin Wu and crypto news site 8BTCNews have both claimed that as of Wednesday, search results for some of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges are pulling up zero results.Cointelegraph’s staff in China have themselves searched for cryptocurrency exchanges on the search engines and confirmed that results are inaccessible. However, a compound search such as “Binance Academy” or “Huobi Research Center” does still seem to be passing through the censors.If the situation continues, this appears to be the latest step in Beijing’s increasing censorship of cryptocurrency-related information via social media. On Monday, Weibo — China’s Twitter-like microblogging service with over 530 million monthly active users — suspended accounts belonging to multiple popular Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto-related content creators.Colin Wu, or Wu Blockchain on Twitter, has noted that searches for Binance, Huobi and OKEx are not showing up for users of Baidu and Sogou, two major Chinese search engines. In addition, both Wu and 8BTCNews claim that Weibo has imposed the same black-out measures, with Wu noting that Zhihu — an analog to Quora — has also followed in step.Censorship measures form just a part of China’s attempt to restrict various cryptocurrency activities, including mining and fundraising themes, deeming the latter illegal. Areas being targeted include financial and payment institutions’ provision of services related to cryptocurrency and token financing platforms that could be used as fiat-to-crypto gateways. The crackdown on mining has focused on the government’s concerns over the industry’s carbon footprint, especially in areas such as Inner Mongolia. At least three mining companies — BTC.TOP, Huobi and HashCow — have announced they would be ceasing activities on the mainland.As of yet, representatives from the targeted exchanges have not made any public announcement regarding the apparent social media censorship measures. Binance could not provide comment on the situation but noted “that Binance does not currently hold exchange operations in China.”"
584,"The cost of using the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains is on the rapid decline, as evidenced by a 93%–95% reduction in average transaction fees over the past couple of months.Fees are paid to the miners who process transactions on a typical proof-of-work blockchain. The size of the fee depends on the size of the transaction in bytes and how many transactions a coin has gone through in the past (as these need to be checked every time a coin is moved). Supply and demand for space also dictate the size of a transaction fee since blockchains have limited capacity.Both Bitcoin and Ethereum saw their transaction costs surge to all-time highs in 2021 in April and May, respectively, coinciding with their rising coin valuations and price peaks.Bitcoin’s average transaction fee hit $62.77 on April 24 — a figure that exceeded the $55 all-time high from December 2017, which stood for more than three years. By Sunday, fees had fallen as low as $4.38. That marked a 93% reduction and sent Bitcoin’s average fee back to levels not seen since December 2020, prior to 2021’s market pump.The same general pattern was witnessed on Ethereum, where average transaction fees rose as high as $69.92 on May 12. That was another all-time high for the cost of using Ethereum and was undoubtedly fuelled in part by the flurry of activity that accompanied the launch of decentralized finance and the Uniswap exchange, which has long been the biggest consumer of resources on Ethereum.On Sunday, Ethereum’s average fees were as low as $3.44 — a figure not seen since the first day of January 2021 — amounting to a 95% reduction. Fees on both blockchains tend to jump whenever there is a sudden increase to the coin’s price or a new application that increases network usage.As reported previously by Cointelegraph, the transaction count on both Bitcoin and Ethereum is also on the decline. Between January and June, the daily number of Bitcoin transactions fell from around 400,000, to just 175,000. Likewise, the number of daily Ethereum transactions fell from 1.6 million to 1 million between May and June alone, marking a 37.5% drop."
585,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been criticized for wielding what many perceive to be irresponsible influence over the cryptocurrency market. Musk regularly took to Twitter to post memes and hot takes on various cryptocurrencies throughout most of 2021, not least Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE).Musk soon added another coin to that list — CumRocket (CUMMIES). CumRocket is described as a “revolutionary deflationary token” aimed to be used by those in the adult film industry.On Friday, Musk posted a cryptic tweet with three words listed: Canada, USA, Mexico. Observers interpreted this as Musk cheekily writing the word “CUM,” and within hours, the price of a little-known token called CumRocket more than doubled.Fast forward 24 hours, and Musk was at it again. This time he posted a sequence of emojis that could reasonably be interpreted as “CumRocket to the moon.”–>Within just 10 minutes, the price of CumRocket jumped from $0.06 to $0.28 — a 366% increase. Predictably, the speculative pump didn’t last for long, and by the time of publication, the CUMMIES token price had fallen back to around $0.07.One of the first Bitcoin (BTC) exchange operators and co-founder of Zap Protocol, Nick Spanos told Cointelegraph he believes much of Musk’s market-moving activity is designed to appropriate more assets at a cheaper price than he otherwise would have.“Musk harmed countless people less fortunate than he in his selfish shilling and moves to get cheaper coin,” said Spanos.The prime example of this, if true, would perhaps be Musk’s announcement that Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and that the car company would accept BTC for payment. Less than a few weeks later, Musk enacted a swift reversal of sentiment on Bitcoin, which he derided for its environmental impact, and summarily removed it as a payment option on the Tesla website.Even if Musk just got bored of Bitcoin, his tweets to over 50 million followers amount to recklessness and an abuse of trust, says Spanos.“People believe in Bitcoin because it’s a path to monetary independence from central banks, and he’s attacking their trust with reckless tweets and abuse of influence. Instead of being a role model, he is revealing less favorable primal characteristics.”Musk has previously said he would welcome any investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission into the effect his tweets have had on the crypto market. Spanos said Musk’s arrogance and greed will have to be paid for, whether to the SEC, or anonymous hacker groups, such as Anonymous. (Anonymous has since denied responsibility for the video addressed to Elon Musk.)“Arrogance and greed cannot shield him from consequences. If the SEC isn’t going to sanction him for manipulating markets like they did before, perhaps the activists will,” said Spanos.“It’s not hard to imagine a scenario where people who trust their lives with his technology could see incidents where that trust maybe even catastrophically ends,” he added.As reported by the BBC, one woman lost 9,000 British pounds ($12,700) in a Bitcoin scam that was falsely presented as an official giveaway by Elon Musk. Such fake giveaways are nothing new in the cryptocurrency space, but would this one have occurred if Musk wasn’t already placing himself at the front and center of the cryptosphere?Whatever the answer, Spanos believes Musk’s time would be better spent actually using and implementing blockchain technologies and inventing ways for people to reach their own level of economic freedom.“If I were Elon, I would be double checking my penetration tests and spending more time implementing blockchain solutions — and finding ways to help the people rise to their highest level of freedom,” said Spanos."
586,"Bitcoin (BTC) headed toward $35,000 on Wednesday, boosted by historic news that El Salvador had made it legal tender. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed a swift uptick in BTC/USD on Wednesday as Bitcoin saw its first adoption move by an official state.The #BitcoinLaw has been approved by a supermajority in the Salvadoran Congress.

62 out of 84 votes!

History! #BtcWhile some celebrated the decision by El Salvador’s parliament, traders remained edgy. As Cointelegraph reported, expectations call for a short-term return to $35,000 before a reversal and deeper BTC price dip takes hold. “Bitcoin printing a higher low, expecting some more bounce today,” popular trader Crypto Ed summarized on Twitter.A starker warning had come from trader Crypto Cobra, who this week repeated forecasts of a significant write-down across cryptocurrency. This, he said, could cost tokens 20%, meaning that Bitcoin would target $25,000.Crypto Ed nonetheless added that a declining United States dollar, which as recently as Monday was on the up, could yet create the conditions for a “miracle” growth spurt in Bitcoin.“All we need for a bullish BTC,” he commented on the latest readings from the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY). Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s renewed upward trajectory had a generally positive knock-on effect for altcoins.A look at the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization showed gains typically reaching 3% on the day, with some exceptions up or down.Ether (ETH) was above $2,500, yet like Bitcoin, still over 5% lower versus its position a week ago. The overall crypto market cap stood at just under $1.54 trillion, with Bitcoin’s dominance at 41.6%."
587,"May was a testing time for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). The flagship digital asset was already wobbling after rallying to nearly $65,000 in mid April, owing to profit-taking sentiment among traders.Elon Musk accelerated the sell-off by reversing his company's plans to accept Bitcoin as payment for Tesla's electric cars.Later in the month, the People's Bank of China reiterated to the country's financial institutions against the use of virtual currencies for payments. Chinese authorities are also starting to keep a close eye on crypto mining — the process by which computers mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.More blows to the cryptocurrency sector came from the U.S. tax and monetary authorities, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who suggested that more regulations are needed.All and all, the flurry of negative updates caused the cryptocurrency market to lose more than $500 billion in May. Being the benchmark digital asset, Bitcoin also suffered the brunt of aggressive downside pressure, falling 35.50% in the month.Meanwhile, physical gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded its strongest months in May 2021 since September 2020. The funds across the globe attracted a combined total of $3.4 billion compared to September's $4.8 billion, according to data provided by the World Gold Council (WGC).In detail, U.S.-based gold ETFs experienced an inflow worth $2.1 billion. The European gold ETFs reported $1.6 billion worth of deposits. Nonetheless, Asian funds tracking the precious metal's prices noted an outflow of about $300 million.Strong demand for gold ETFs also contributed to the rise of its spot prices. As a result, the XAU/USD exchange rate jumped 7.6% in May to $1,912.785 an ounce.The polar opposite moves in Bitcoin and Gold markets indicated that a short-term negative correlation has been brewing between them. In addition, Wall Street veterans Nick Colas and Jessica Rabe also wrote in their DataTrek Research report that the sell-off in virtual currencies might have boosted gold's appeal among institutional investors.The market strategists projected Bitcoin as a riskier alternative to Gold. Meanwhile, they noted that the precious metal's value does not decline by half in five weeks because of Elon Musk tweets, nor does it respond to policymakers' ban threats.Bitcoin is largely a speculative bet for wealthy and small retail investors seeking quick profits. But the fixed supply of BTC has also seen it benefit from fears of rising inflation, similar to gold. Corporates including Tesla, Ruffer Investments, Square, and MicroStrategy added Bitcoin to their cash-ruled balance sheets.They did so to offset inflation risks brought forth by the Federal Reserve's unprecedented expansionary policies, including near-zero interest rates and a $120 billion monthly asset purchasing program. The high-profile investments played a key role in doubling Bitcoin prices in the first quarter of 2021, fueled further higher to around $65,000 by mid-April by an increase in debt-fueled leveraged bets and influx of new retail traders into the market.On the other hand, Gold ETFs reported six months of back-to-back outflows until May 2021. JPMorgan analysts in January 2021 reported that gold ETFs lost about $7 billion in the same period Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a trust operated by New York-based Grayscale Investments, attracted $3 billion.The lack of capital injection into precious metal funds also lowered its spot bids; XAU/USD closed the first 2021 quarter down 10.14% opposed to Bitcoin's 100% returns.In May 2021, another JPMorgan report suggested that large institutional investors secured their profits in Bitcoin to seek opportunities in gold. They cited open interest data in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that experienced its biggest drop since October 2020. JPMorgan analysts said:The statements also appeared as Ruffer Investments, a U.K.-based fund that manages about $33.95 billion for wealthy individuals and charities, also announced Tuesday that it has unloaded its entire Bitcoin position and has netted $1.56 billion in profits.Duncan MacInnes, investment director at Ruffer, told the Finance Times that they had shifted the funds into gold, commodity stocks, and inflation-protected bonds.Macinnes added that Bitcoin is still ""on the menu"" of Ruffer's potential investments in the future, noting that the world is desperate for new safe-haven against ultra-low bond yields."
588,"Bitcoin (BTC) edged closer to the significant $30,000 support on June 8 amid predictions that a major crypto correction was imminent.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD making repeated lower lows on short timeframes during June 8.A previous dip took the pair to $32,000 before a brief rebound, with that level subsequently giving way.At the time of writing, Bitcoin was plumbing to levels not seen since May's initial $30,000 correction, with BTC focusing in on $31,500.As Cointelegraph reported, traders have gone on record to predict a fresh capitulation event across cryptocurrencies, something that could shave around 20% off the total crypto market capitalization. Under such circumstances, Bitcoin could trade at $25,000 in the short term.""From a technical point of view its difficult not to see $30k being tested and probably break,"" Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite Decentrader, told Cointelegraph.A look at buy and sell positions on largest global exchange, Binance, shows support lining up at $30,500, with resistance curiously thin below $40,000.For on-chain monitoring service Whalemap, meanwhile, essential support areas for BTC/USD more broadly begin at $28,000.Analysts used the ""cohort-based realized price,"" a metric that extends realized price according to how large a wallet is, along with the prices at which current hodlers bought while Bitcoin was running to its $64,500 all-time highs.""To conclude, there is massive confluence at the 19k level which makes it super hard for BTC to go lower than that,"" the analysts tweeted.Nonetheless, should Bitcoin go below $20,000, it would be the first time in history that the high from a previous bull cycle has been broken."
589,"Bitcoin (BTC) is heading for ""absolute carnage"" that will result in a trip to around $25,000, a popular trader has warned as bullish signals disappear for BTC/USD.In characteristically direct tweets this week, Twitter user Cobra Crypto warned that 20% is about to be shaved off the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization.Bitcoin has suffered from downside over recent days despite ""feel-good"" news stories from the Bitcoin 2021 conference, including adoption in Latin America.Now, after BTC/USD lost 9% overnight, attention is turning not to a recovery but to a deeper price dip to test hodlers' ""diamond hands.""According to Cobra Crypto, the size of the capitulation will cost the $30,000 support that remained during the May retracement.""Absolute carnage within next 5 days or you can tell me how wrong I was,"" he wrote on June 4.An update gave a time limit of 48 hours from June 7 for the fresh losses to enter the market. Bitcoin, he argued, would not stop at $32,000.This isn't even the dump. Just wait another 48 hours max.At the time of writing, BTC/USD traded at $33,000, having toyed with $32,000 repeatedly over the course of June 8.Cobra Crypto added that he would ""scale back in"" to Bitcoin at prices below $28,000.Bitcoin's problems are meanwhile already spilling over into altcoins, some of which previously managed to buck the overall downtrend to deliver solid gains to holders.With the exception of Theta Fuel (TFUEL) and exchange iFinex's Unus Sed Leo (LEO) token, all top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap were in the red on June 8.A 20% reduction would bring the overall cryptocurrency market cap down to around $1.13 trillion, still preserving its trillion-dollar status.Crypto Cobra was not alone in predicting negative price moves. As Cointelegraph reported, fellow trader Crypto Ed is also betting on a further downturn for Bitcoin.""Beware, I think we still get 1 leg down, the bounce is weak,"" he warned in his latest update."
590,"Cryptocurrencies might be anathema for certain members of United States President Joe Biden's administration, but that has not stopped one staffer from owning a small fortune in Bitcoin (BTC).According to a report by Politico on Monday, Tim Wu, special assistant for technology and competition policy to the president at the National Economic Council, owns over $1 million in Bitcoin.Wu’s BTC ownership came to light after a recent personal financial disclosure that also revealed his ownership of Filecoin (FIL). Wu reportedly owns between $1 million and $5 million worth of Bitcoin as well as between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of FIL.The White House adviser’s Bitcoin pot allegedly constitutes a major portion of Wu’s financial portfolio, which is estimated to be between $4 million and $11.5 million in value. Based on his estimated Bitcoin ownership, Wu may hold between 29 and 146 BTC.Wu, a prominent legal scholar and Columbia University law professor, has previously argued against Bitcoin’s value proposition. Back in December 2018, Wu joined the chorus of critics labeling BTC a bubble as the premier cryptocurrency rallied to a then all-time high near $20,000.The legal scholar is also a noted critic of Big Tech firms and was responsible for coining the term “net neutrality” back in 2003. According to Politico, an anonymous source at the White House said Wu has recused himself from policy matters related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.Back in August 2017, Wu weighed in on the Bitcoin hard fork saga that led to the emergence of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). At the time, Wu criticized Coinbase’s initial decision to not support the fork and temporarily prevent its users from accessing BCH.Bitcoin and crypto in general are coming under increased scrutiny under the Biden administration, with the new anti-BTC narrative seemingly shifting toward ransomware attacks. Both Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have hinted at stricter cryptocurrency regulations."
591,"A recent run-up in Ether (ETH) prices against its top rival, Bitcoin (BTC), appears to be at the risk of exhaustion, even as analysts see the second-largest cryptocurrency as the stronger of the two.The ETH/BTC exchange rate has risen by up to 40.19% after bottoming out at 0.0553 BTC on May 23. The powerful rebound move reflected a spike in the capital flow from the spot ETH to spot BTC market. That also led analysts at Delphi Digital, an independent market research firm, to highlight Ether's ""formidable strength"" in the Bitcoin-quoted markets. They wrote:But a closer look into the ETH/BTC chart returns evidence that bullish traders might be heading into a bull trap.ETH/BTC formed a pattern that began wide at the bottom and contracted as the price moved higher. As a result, the trading range narrowed. Meanwhile, the volumes declined as the prices rose and the contracting pattern evolved.Classic chartists refer to the structure as a rising wedge. They interpret it as a traditional bearish reversal pattern, primarily because of the loss of the upside momentum on each successive high formation.Rising wedges mature as the asset reaches the level where its two trendlines converge. Nevertheless, bearish confirmations do not come until the price breaks below the wedge support in a convincing fashion. But if it does, the asset risks crashing by as much as the maximum distance between the wedge's upper and lower trendline.Therefore, the ETH/BTC rising wedge indicator suggests a decline toward 0.0648 BTC on a negative breakout attempt from the pattern's apex — the point at which the trendlines converge. Also, the 0.0648 BTC level served as support throughout May.Delphi Digital compared the responses of ETH/BTC to Bitcoin's cyclical tops in 2018 and 2021 to explain its bullish outlook for the pair.The firm stressed that ETH/BTC was comparatively a weaker instrument during the 2017 price rally than during 2021. The pair topped out mid-cycle — in June 2017 — even as Bitcoin continued climbing and reached $20,000 by year's end. By then, ETH/BTC had crashed by more than 85%.But a massive correction in Bitcoin prices in January 2018 offloaded capital into the altcoin markets, causing a short-term upside correction in BTC-enabled pairs. Ether also benefited from the money flow from Bitcoin markets, as it rebounded from 0.0231 BTC in December 2017 to 0.1237 BTC in January 2018 — a 435.44% rise.ETH/BTC then started correcting lower in the weekly sessions as both Bitcoin and Ether took a beating in dollar-quoted markets. The pair eventually crashed from 0.1237 BTC, then a year-to-date top, to as low as 0.0246 BTC in December 2018.But that is not the case with the ongoing ETH/BTC correction, noted Delphi Digital, writing:Whether or not ETH/BTC will undergo a negative breakout appears to depend on how Bitcoin performs in dollar-quoted markets.The BTC/USD exchange rate declined by up to 53.77% from its record high, near $65,000, and started consolidation later. Meanwhile, the ETH/USD rate also corrected in tandem with BTC/USD, plunging 60.59% from its all-time high of $4,384. That shows a strong linear correlation between the two digital assets.Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center NYC, told Cointelegraph that Ether would need to break its correlation with Bitcoin in the dollar-denominated markets to have an independent ETH/BTC trend. Until then, sharp downside moves in ETH/USD and BTC/USD would also mean a depressive ETH/BTC trend. He added:Yuriy Mazur, head of the data analysis department at cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO, added that the ongoing anti-inflation narrative could allow Bitcoin to resume its uptrend. As a result, the rest of the cryptocurrency market, including Ether, should follow suit. He told Cointelegraph:"
592,"Twelve months ago, the total value of cryptocurrency locked in staking programs was barely more than $1 billion. Today, there is $58 billion locked in decentralized finance, or DeFi. The adoption of DeFi has been a sea change that’s helped push the crypto industry into the mainstream, but it’s hardly the only one.Mainstream institutions including MicroStrategy and Tesla have poured billions of dollars into Bitcoin — and some have been buying the dip — while nonfungible tokens have evolved from CryptoKitties and CypherPunks to an artistic medium pulling in millions in bids for a new generation of digital artists like Beeple at famed auction houses like Christie’s and Sotheby’s.With a dramatic further disruption of existing industries like music, sports and property starting to take shape, NFTs look to be set for substantial continued growth in years to come.More broadly, the blockchain industry grew 639% year over year, according to DappRadar’s Dapp Industry Report for the first quarter of 2021. It’s now reaching 458,000 daily unique active wallets, the report found. With new users and investors come new risks, as the more than $100 million stolen from crypto users during Q1 2021 — mostly in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi) — shows.With all those changes and all those wallets, the technology cannot stand still, particularly when it comes to wallet security and functionality.Between those factors and a growing number of requests from its community, CoolBitX has unveiled a new and upgraded version of its CoolWallet, which first introduced Bluetooth technology in a hardware crypto wallet in 2016 and followed it up with its multi-asset supporting CoolWallet S in 2018.CoolWallet Pro adds more supported coins (including Polkadot, Cosmos and Tron) and advances in military-grade security to not only offer a more secure hardware wallet but also to allow more advanced users greater flexibility and options in how they put their stored assets to work — generating passive income in the form of straightforward coin staking as well as more risky endeavors such as DeFi staking and liquidity mining, which could potentially yield exponentially higher returns.The latest addition to the CoolWallet line adds an upgraded CC EAL 6+ military-grade hardware security chip (up from 5+ in the model S) that permanently locks away the wallet’s private key. It offers a number of authentication mechanisms, including biometric identity verification, in addition to PIN code and physical offline verification steps.But the real story is the CoolWallet Pro’s addition of substantial staking support features, CoolBitX CEO Michael Ou said.MORE INSIGHTS FROM COOLWALLET HEREPointing to “the proliferation of innovative financial products and services such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), DeFi and DApps that are creating compelling new use cases for cryptocurrency ownership and redefining the way we view digital assets,” Ou explained that advanced industry participants needed more than an update.“Our CoolWallet community has demanded a bridge to participate in this new economy, that matches and even improves the security and convenience they are used to with CoolWallet S.”To make the CoolWallet Pro a reality during a “historic period of digital asset adoption” meant working with a number of partners, most notably staking infrastructure firm Staked, “to allow users to spend, lend, borrow, and invest their tokens at their leisure anytime, anywhere, thus maximizing the value of their crypto assets,” Ou added.Still credit card-sized like the HODLer-focused CoolWallet S, the CoolWallet Pro is waterproof and uses patented compression technology to remain tamper-proof. It uses encrypted Bluetooth (military-grade AES-256 standard) to connect to the CoolBitX App.From there, CoolWallet Pro users can connect to the app to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Ripple, Stellar, Binance Coin, Tether, and all ERC-20 tokens. It adds three new cryptocurrencies for staking: Cosmos, Polkadot and Tron — with Binance Smart Chain, Kusama, Eth2 and Cardano to come.The staking process is simple. Choose a cryptocurrency to stake, then select an address and delegated proof-of-stake validator. An estimated reward will appear if available, and if it’s satisfactory, verify the transaction with your CoolWallet Pro card. You can manage the stake by either claiming rewards or unstaking your coins.Another option is X-Saving, which deposits Tether stablecoins and then distributes it to DeFi and CeFi options. Separate KYC identity confirmation is required.The app will add integrated DeFi, DApp, and NFT support in Q3. Down the line, in-app Web 3.0 WebView integration, and layer-two scaling support are also planned.Regarding NFT support, CoolWallet plans to integrate the leading current decentralized NFT marketplaces in the app to allow its users to trade, bid and enjoy their NFTs within the app. Users will even be able to create new NFTs with CoolWallet by utilizing an integrated NFT minting DApp.For DeFi, CoolWallet Pro won't just merely connect users to the vast ecosystem of DeFi projects, but establish a much deeper integration with DeFi aggregators. This will help CoolWallet Pro users to earn passive income from complex DeFi protocols with ease, and without the need for technical knowledge.Learn more about CoolWalletDisclaimer.

593,"Earlier this week, a Bank of America survey found that American hedge fund managers favor Bitcoin (BTC) over tech, but a Goldman Sachs poll with chief investment officers in Asia tells a different story.Goldman Sach Global Investment Research published a new survey polling 25 chief investment officers from different hedge funds in Asia. The results show that Bitcoin is the least favorite investment class for 35% of the participants.“We held two CIO roundtable sessions earlier this week, which were attended by 25 CIOs from various long-only and hedge funds,” wrote Goldman Sachs strategist Timothy Moe. “Their most favorite is Growth style but least favorite on Bitcoin.”New initial public offerings follow Bitcoin as the least favorite investment style with 25%.On the other hand, more than half (55%) favor growth investing, which is to invest in companies that offer strong earnings growth. This is followed by value-style investing (30%) — i.e., seeking out undervalued assets in the market.While the poll sample size is small for generalization, Goldman Sachs’ poll draws a stark contrast with the recent survey from the Bank of America (BofA). With responses from 194 fund managers with $592 billion worth of assets under management, the BofA survey suggests that the “long Bitcoin” bet is now the most crowded trade across all markets.According to the BofA survey, “long Bitcoin” has even surpassed trading “long tech,” with almost 45% of respondents favoring the largest cryptocurrency over tech. Trades identified as crowded have historically heralded an incoming top for their respective markets, BofA noted in survey remarks.Following a bearish month, Bitcoin has had a rocky start for June. As miners sold more than 5,000 BTC over the past week, Bitcoin crashed below $33,000 for the first time since May 23.The global crypto market lost about $500 billion this week alone. The last two months’ losses after the peak in April have completely wiped out the previous quarter’s growth in the market."
594,"The global crypto market lost $200 billion overnight leading into Tuesday morning, adding to $300 billion in losses for the week. Momentum pushed the global market capitalization down since Bitcoin (BTC) hit a recent peak in April, followed by an altcoin peak in early May. Following $1.1 trillion in losses since then, the previous quarter’s growth has been completely eradicated across the breadth of the crypto space.The recent slump also coincides with a marked decline in the number of transactions flowing through the Bitcoin blockchain. On May 30, the number of daily Bitcoin transactions dipped as low as 175,000 — a near three-year low that stretches back to September 2018, according to data from BitInfoCharts.The number of Bitcoin transactions hit 392,000 in January 2021 and remained fairly stable up until April 15 — two days after the coin price peaked. Since then, both have been in decline, with transactions dropping by more than 50% throughout May.The same general pattern was witnessed with Ether (ETH), where daily transactions sank from 1.6 million on May 11 (the same day the coin price peaked) to 1 million by Sunday — a 37.5% decline.The number of on-chain transactions doesn’t paint the full picture for Bitcoin or Ether, owing to the former’s use in the Lightning Network and the latter’s utilization by its own multitude of layer-two protocols.The dollar value of coins locked in the Lightning Network also declined heavily since hitting an all-time high of $76 million on April 14, dropping to $47 million by the time of publication.Whether the general decline continues is a matter of intense speculation for market analysts, who provide both optimistic and ominous predictions for the future direction of BTC’s price."
595,"Bitcoin (BTC) traded worryingly near $30,000 support on Tuesday amid fresh predictions of incoming lows.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed BTC/USD as the pair lost 9% overnight on Monday.No amount of good news was able to help bulls, with potential adoption breakthroughs in Latin America conspicuously doing nothing to boost lackluster price action.United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen likewise failed to lift the mood when she voiced support for higher inflation.Instead, Bitcoin dropped to $32,000 at the time of writing, coming off a rebound to $33,000.For popular trader Crypto Ed, the outlook was uninspiring — and even included a trip below the $30,000 mark.“It did the white ABC I posted before the weekend,” he told Twitter followers, referring to a forecast price rotation.As Cointelegraph reported, traders are already on edge over a potential “death cross” involving two key moving averages that could spell further downside.This could extend beyond the short term, Cane Island Alternative Advisors investment manager Timothy Peterson noted, thanks to BTC/USD now lingering below its 200-day moving average for almost three weeks.“This metric has *always* marked the end of a bull run and the start of a bear market,” he added in comments on Monday."
596,"One percent of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is currently tokenized as Wrapped BTC (WBTC), equating to nearly $6.2 billion worth of BTC. The milestone was acknowledged by the product manager of crypto custody firm BitGo, Kia Mosayeri, who tweeted the news on June 7. BitGo is the custodian for the Wrapped Bitcoin protocol, which was launched its Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token WBTC on Ethereum in January 2019.1% of all BTC has been wrapped into $WBTC! https://t.co/jOi0LZZUyiAccording to Etherscan, there are currently 187,610 Bitcoins wrapped on the protocol, equating to a fully diluted market capitalization of $6.18 billion. The current circulating supply of BTC is nearly 18.73 million, according to CoinGecko, confirming the 1% milestone.BTConEthereum estimates there are 240,620 Bitcoins that have been tokenized across various protocols for use on Ethereum, representing a combined capitalization of $7.91 billion. Wrapped Bitcoin exerts a clear dominance over the sector, representing 78% of all Bitcoin tokenized on Ethereum.Other leading Bitcoin tokenization protocols include second-ranked Huobi BTC with 37,906 BTC or 15.7% of the Bitcoin's supply, and the third-ranked RenBTC with 10,226 tokenized BTC. Synthetic BTC also holds 1,471 BTC, followed by imBTC with 1,169 Bitcoin, and TBTC with 916 BTC.The recent proliferation of yield farms and interest-bearing Ethereum-based DeFi protocols supporting tokenized BTC has been the primary force driving the sector’s growth.In late April, Ethereum-based BTC yield protocol BadgerDAO teamed up with RenVM to launch a bridge between renBTC and its own yield farms. DeFi Llama estimates that more than $540 million worth of assets is locked on the BadgerDAO platform."
597,"The crypto markets are against dropping, with Bitcoin (BTC) crashing below $33,000 for the first time since May 23 as Ether (ETH) similarly broke below support at $2,500.The downward momentum comes as bearish indicators continue to stack up for Bitcoin, with popular analyst William Clemente III identifying that miners sold more than 5,000 BTC over the past week — worth roughly $164 million at current prices.Miners have sold over 5,000 BTC in the last week pic.twitter.com/5pEvLgIls2Crypto author Timothy Peterson also highlighted that BTC’s price has remained below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) for 17 days consecutively.”This metric has *always* marked the end of a bull run and the start of a bear market,” he asserted.#Bitcoin price has dropped below 200-SMA for 17 consecutive days and counting. This metic has *always* marked the end of a bull run and the start of a bear market. pic.twitter.com/6dpiFbUI7AAlthough the markets appear to be posting a small intra-day bounce — with BTC currently hovering near $33,000 after dropping to $32,400 and ETH currently changing hands for $2,500 after bouncing off a local low of roughly $2,430 — both markets have crashed approximately 15% since posting respective local highs of $39,600 and $2,900, respectively, on Thursday.However, while both Ether and Bitcoin have been shedding value over recent weeks, capital flows for crypto investment products suggest that institutional investors are pivoting toward Ether.According to a Monday report from CoinShares, Bitcoin investment products saw record outflows of $141 billion this past week, while Ether products reported inflows of $22 million."
598,"The May 19 crypto market sell-off saw $1.2 trillion in value erased from the total market capitalization as the froth and excess leverage of over-hyped markets was quickly eliminated.But similar to a forest fire, whose destructive power is essential to the rejuvenation of a forest's ecosystem, dramatic market shake-outs are a vital part of the full life cycle of a developing market, as excesses that have accumulated are burned away and cleared in order to set the stage for a new round of growth.According to data from Glassnode, the past month saw a “historically large decline” in on-chain activity, “transitioning rapidly from booming on-chain economies at ATH prices, to almost completely clear mempools and waning demand for transactions and settlement.”This clearing of congestion helped address the rising cost of fees on both the Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) networks which have now “returned to mid-2020 levels of around $3.50 to $4.50” after experiencing short term spikes as high as $60 in April and May but given the lingering price action from BTC and Ether, traders are also worried whether the market has shifted from bullish to bearish.The drop in activity has resulted in a 65% decline in the total USD denominated transfer volume settled by the Bitcoin network and a 60% decrease in value transferred on Ethereum, marking the second largest declines for the networks behind the 80% drop for Bitcoin in 2017 and the 95% drop for Ethereum in 2018.Although the on-chain activity paints a grim picture for some, as short-term holders were the hardest hit by the downturn, a closer look shows that long-term holders (LTH) have started accumulating again, a sign that the worst of the shake-out may have passed.As seen in the chart above, the supply held by long-term BTC holders has begun to accelerate upward following a period of distribution that happened as the price rallied from $10,000 to $64,000. This rising figure indicates that the “LTH supply is now in a firm uptrend,” and is similar to the trend seen during the “late 2017 bull and early 2018 bear.”Glassnode said:Further bullishness can be found in the fact that the amount of BTC currently held by LTHs is 2.3 million more than at the peak of 2017, indicating that the long-term view of these token holders is that the market is headed higher.One final indication that the market may be consolidating in preparation for its next move higher can be found looking at the change in the liquid and illiquid supply of BTC over the past 6 months.As seen in the chart above, 160,700 BTC went from an illiquid state back into liquid circulation during the month of May, representing just 22% of the total supply that moved from liquid to illiquid since March 2020.This means that 78% of the BTC acquired since then remains unspent, indicating an overall positive outlook by long-term holders.While it's impossible to be certain about the next steps for the cryptocurrency market thanks to factors like unpredictable volatility, erratic tweets from influencers and the rumors of surprise government crackdowns, on-chain data indicates a positive long-term outlook that should resume once the current shake-out and consolidation periods subside.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

599,"Margin trading allows investors to borrow stablecoins or cryptocurrency to leverage their position and improve the expected return. For example, borrowing Tether (USDT) will allow one to buy Bitcoin (BTC), thus increasing their Bitcoin long position. Investors can also borrow BTC to margin trade a short position, thus betting on price downside. This is why some analysts monitor the total lending amounts of Bitcoin and Tether to gain insight into whether investors are leaning bullish or bearish.This week, some prominent analysts cited a surge in Bitcoin short positions on Bitfinex, peaking at 6,621 BTC on June 7. As Cointelegraph reported, independent researcher Fomocap found a visible correlation between margined short positions and the May 19 price crash.However, when analyzing a broader scope of data — including the margin longs, perpetual contracts funding rate and protective put options — there is no evidence of prominent players preparing for a surprise negative move.A single instance of Bitcoin margin shorts spiking ahead of the negative price swing should not be considered a leading indicator. Furthermore, one needs to factor in Bitcoin margin longs — an opposing, usually larger force.As the above chart indicates, even on May 17 the number of BTC/USD long margin contracts outpaced shorts by 3.6, at 39,000 BTC. In fact, the last time this indicator dropped below 2.0, favoring longs, was on Nov. 26, 2020. The result was not good for the shorts, as Bitcoin rallied 64% over the following 30 days.Whenever traders borrow Tether and stablecoins, they are likely long on cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, BTC borrowing is mainly used for short positions.Theoretically, whenever the USDT/BTC lending ratio goes up, the market is angled in a bullish manner. The ratio at OKEx bottomed at 3.5 on May 20, favoring longs, but it quickly returned to the 5.5 level. Therefore, there is no evidence of a significant movement favoring shorts on margin markets.Perpetual futures prices trade very close to regular spot exchanges, making the lives of retail traders a lot easier because they no longer need to calculate the futures premium.This magic can only be achieved by the funding rate charged from longs (buyers) when demanding more leverage. However, when the situation is reversed and shorts (sellers) are over-leveraged, the funding rate goes negative, and they become the ones paying the fee.As displayed above, the funding rate has been mostly flat since May 19. Had there been a massive surge for shorting demand, the indicator would have reflected the move.The call (buy) option provides its buyer with upside price protection, and the put (sell) does the opposite. This means traders aiming for neutral-to-bearish strategies will typically rely on put options. On the other hand, call options are more commonly used for bullish positions.Take notice of how the neutral-to-bullish call options outnumber the protective puts by nearly 90%. Had professional traders and whales been anticipating a market crash, this ratio would have been positively impacted.Investors should not make trading decisions based on a single indicator, as the remaining markets and exchanges may not corroborate it. For now, there is absolutely no indication that heavy players are betting on Bitcoin short positions.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
600,"United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen defended President Joe Biden’s latest massive spending package while speaking to Bloomberg. Yellen said it would be “a plus” for society even if it resulted in a higher interest rate environment.If rates inch higher, traders will explore the best possible options to hedge their portfolios. While gold is down about 2.5% year-to-date, Bitcoin (BTC) is still up 22% during the same period, even after the massive plunge in May.Bitcoin’s outperformance may not go unnoticed and several institutional investors are likely to make it a part of their portfolio along with gold.London-based asset management firm Ruffer booked a profit of more than $1 billion on an investment of $600 million in Bitcoin. Ruffer’s investment director Hamish Baillie in an interview with The Times said the company bought in November and sold its “last tranche in April.” Baillie said institutional investors, including Ruffer, are likely to continue buying Bitcoin.This suggests that Bitcoin is likely to attract huge institutional interest at lower levels, which may act as a strong floor. The larger the purchases by institutions at lower levels, the higher the price is likely to rally during the next bull phase.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine their next possible trending move.Bitcoin dropped to the trendline of the symmetrical triangle on June 5 but the bears could not break this support. The bulls successfully defended the trendline for the past two days and are attempting a rebound off it today.The buyers will have to push the price above the resistance line of the triangle to gain the upper hand. If they manage to do that, the BTC/USDT pair could extend the relief rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($46,784).A breakout and close above the 50-day SMA will be the first indication that the downtrend could be ending.However, the downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory suggest advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the triangle, the pair could witness panic selling. That may pull the price down to the critical support zone at $30,000 to $28,000.Ether (ETH) turned down from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on June 4 but the shallow correction shows the bulls are buying on dips. The price has risen back above the 20-day exponential moving average ($2,743) and the bulls are challenging the resistance line of the triangle.If buyers propel the price above the triangle and the 50-day SMA ($2,918), it will suggest the start of a rally to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,362.72. This level may act as stiff resistance but if the bulls arrest the next decline above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the downtrend could be over.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and slides below $2,550, the ETH/USDT pair could drop to the support line of the triangle. A bounce off this support could extend the stay of the pair inside the triangle.The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the support line of the triangle. Such a move could clear the path for a decline to $2,180.53 and then $1,728.74.Binance Coin (BNB) turned down from $433 on June 4 and the bears thwarted another attempt by the bulls to clear the resistance on June 5. This suggests the bears are aggressively defending the $433 level.Although the price traded below the 20-day EMA ($398) for the past two days, the bears could not sink the BNB/USDT pair to the trendline. This suggests that bulls may be regrouping to make another assault at the $433 level.If buyers succeed in driving the price above this resistance, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($492) and then to the 78.6% retracement level at $589.04.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and drops below $365, the pair may correct to the trendline. A break below this support will suggest the bears are back in the game.Cardano (ADA) turned down from $1.88 on June 3 but the bulls have not allowed the price to sustain below the 20-day EMA (1.67). This suggests the sentiment is turning positive and the bulls are buying on dips to the 20-day EMA.The buyers will now have to push the price above $1.94 to gain the upper hand. If that happens, the ADA/UDST pair could rally to the all-time high at $2.47. A breakout and close above this resistance will suggest the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest aggressive selling at higher levels. That could keep the pair range-bound between the 50-day SMA ($1.56) and $1.94 for a few days.The first sign of weakness will be a break below $1.33. That could open the doors for a further slide to $1.Dogecoin (DOGE) had formed a Doji candlestick pattern on June 5 and 6 near the 20-day EMA ($0.37), indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.If bears sink the price below $0.35, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the neckline of a large head and shoulders pattern. A breakdown and close below the neckline will be a huge negative as that could increase the possibility of a drop to $0.10.However, the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a few days of range-bound action. If the price turns up from the neckline, the pair could rise to $0.47 and remain stuck between these levels for a few days.A breakout and close above $0.47 will be the first sign of strength. It will clear the path for a northward march toward $0.59.XRP’s price is getting squeezed between the 20-day EMA ($1.03) and $0.88 for the past few days. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 44 indicate advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA and breaks below $0.88, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to $0.79 and then to the May 23 low at $0.65.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls propel the price above $1.10. If that happens, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($1.23) and then to the downtrend line.This is an important resistance to watch out for because a break above it will suggest the downtrend is over.Polkadot (DOT) has been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few days. The altcoin is attempting to bounce off the trendline of the channel and rise above the overhead resistance at $26.50.If that happens, the DOT/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($31.68) and then to the resistance line of the channel. If the price turns down from the resistance line, the pair may continue to trade inside the channel.However, if the bulls thrust the price above the channel, the momentum could pick up. That will also suggest an end to the downtrend.Conversely, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA or the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies to the moving averages. A break below the trendline of the channel will increase the possibility of a drop to $18.41 and then to $15.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($27.64) on June 4 but the bulls did not allow the price to drop below $25. This suggests a positive sentiment because traders are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.If buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance at $30, the UNI/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($32.79). This level may again act as a stiff resistance.However, if the bulls arrest the next decline at the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment has turned positive. That will enhance the prospects of a rally to the 78.6% retracement level at $38.15.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and plummets below $21.50. Such a move will suggest the bears have overpowered the bulls.Internet Computer (ICP) is struggling to rebound off the $103.71 support for the past two days, which indicates a lack of buyers even at these levels. This increases the likelihood of a break below the support.If that happens, the ICP/USDT pair could drop to the all-time low at $86.01. This is an important support to watch out for because if this level cracks, the pair could extend its decline to $60.The negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $120. That will indicate strong buying at lower levels. A break above $136.60 could open the door for a rally to $168.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading between the downtrend line and the support at $616.04. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($747) and the RSI in the negative zone suggest bears have the upper hand.If the price dips below the $616.04 support, the bears will try to pull the price down to the May 23 support at $468.13. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the decline could extend to $400.Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest buyers are attempting to make a comeback. The BCH/USDT pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($930).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

601,"A lackluster balance sheet, excessive debt load and over-leveraged exposure to Bitcoin have crashed MicroStrategy stock by more than 63% since February already. Nevertheless, the business intelligence company has ignored the risks of its frothy valuations, and it now wants to raise more debt and buy Bitcoin with proceeds (BTC).MicroStrategy announced on June 7 that it ""intends to raise $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in private offering [...] to acquire additional Bitcoins."" The company already holds more than 92,000 BTC, worth about $3.31 billion at current exchange rates — almost 1.5x its principal investment.MSTR plunged 2.17% to $469.29 per share after the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell on June 7. At its year-to-date high, it was changing hands for $1,135.In previous statements, MicroStrategy clarified that it is building up a Bitcoin portfolio as an insurance policy against the continuing devaluation of the world's major currencies. But with its back-to-back Bitcoin purchases, the company has effectively protected itself from more than just the U.S. dollar decline. Here's a hint: unprofitable business lines.A look into MicroStrategy's alternative asset holdings also shows that the company is overly skewed toward Bitcoin, with real estate accounting for less than 0.2% of the total investments.Its latest quarterly report also shows a weaker balance sheet as of March 31, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.55 — a significant debt load of $1.66 billion against an equity valuation of $0.37 billion.That is particularly risky when Bitcoin's price volatility is taken into account. MicroStrategy does not generate sufficient income to service its debt load and hugely relies on Bitcoin profits to do so. Atop that, it now wants to raise another $300 million, although its convertible notes are not due to mature until 2028.Juan De La Hoz, a closed-end fund/exchange-traded fund strategist, fears that MicroStrategy risks becoming insolvent should Bitcoin fall by more than 50% in the future, noting the flagship cryptocurrency's massive declines in the years 2014 and 2018. The analyst added that MicroStrategy would most likely liquidate its Bitcoin holdings to avoid insolvency.Hoz added that he would neither invest in cryptocurrencies through leverage nor invest in a company that did so, hinting at his extremely bearish outlook for MicroStrategy and Bitcoin.Bitcoin prices sleepwalked through MicroStrategy's announcement early in the U.S. morning before trading began on the NYSE. The BTC/USD exchange rate continued trading sideways while maintaining support above $36,000."
602,"Former United States President Donald Trump has once again slammed Bitcoin (BTC).Appearing on FOX Business on Monday, the former president remarked:TRUMP: Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam. I don't like it. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. pic.twitter.com/CXjALsJmXxTrump's comments are in line with his previously espoused views on Bitcoin. Indeed, back in July 2019 while in office, Trump stated that he was not a fan of Bitcoin and crypto.At the time, Trump identified price volatility as a major point for his anti-crypto stance while stating that cryptocurrencies were not money and that their value was based on “thin air.”As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the Trump administration specifically sought to enact anti-crypto policies, with Trump allegedly telling former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to “go after Bitcoin.”The final days of the Trump administration also saw the Treasury stir the pot with controversial regulations aimed at monitoring self-hosted wallets. This Trump-era policy has become even further expanded by the administration of Joe Biden, with the Internal Revenue Service also looking to close crypto-related tax loopholes.However, pro-crypto congresspeople like Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Warren Davidson continue to advocate for crypto wallet privacy rights.The conversation around cryptocurrency regulations in the United States seems to has shifted toward ransomware as the new focus for the anti-crypto crowd in Washington. A spate of ransomware attacks in the U.S. is likely responsible for the new narrative shift.Back in May, Cointelegraph reported that the Biden administration was examining gaps in existing crypto rules in the wake of the recent price downturn in the market."
603,"Many years ago, I ran hedge funds on Wall Street. With a long pause for philanthropic and government work, I eventually found my way to blockchain, and now, I spend my days writing about decentralized finance versus centralized finance. Some of my old Wall Street friends still run a lot of money in hedge funds, and back in 2018, they would tease me and ask if I was still “doing my crypto thing.” Even today, some of them still think that Bitcoin (BTC) is a Ponzi scheme. One of my dearest friends from my past days in finance recently sent me Nobel Prize winner and economist Paul Krugman’s opinion column on Bitcoin in the New York Times, which further reinforces the argument of the fake world of crypto. So, I took up the challenge to answer Paul’s claims.It is clear that Krugman doesn’t think highly of cryptocurrencies. It was clear in 2013 with his initial piece in the New York Times, titled “Bitcoin is Evil” (I sure hope he has not been short this entire time).But actually, I can see where he is coming from, and to be honest, I can think of so many aspects in which cryptocurrencies need to improve. Having said that, repeating the same old tired cliches such as “Bitcoin is only good for illegal activities” or “There is no real use for Bitcoin in real life” does not cut it anymore in 2021. Respectfully, I will say that I was hoping for more from a Nobel laureate in economics.Krugman starts off by comparing Bitcoin’s so-called lack of progress during the past 12 years — since its inception — with other technologies, such as Venmo, the iPad or Zoom that have thrived and become major parts of our lives.Well, let’s begin by examining Bitcoin’s public exposure. What started out as an ultra-niche software (sorry, Satoshi), grew into a $1 trillion asset class (at its peak) as the graph below shows — faster than any other asset — and has become one of the hottest research topics in leading central and commercial banks, as well as in tech companies all around the world. Not to mention, it has become the topic of multiple United States Senate (and other parliamentary) hearings concerning its regulation and economic impact.What’s even more interesting is that Krugman completely ignores the fact that this progress has occurred despite multiple governments’ repeated attempts to fight Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.In my opinion, the resilience of a government’s sovereignty can be measured in two major factors: its national security and its economy. What could be a better metric of economic resilience than a currency? In the past, Krugman has claimed that “fiat money [...] is backed by men with guns,” which may explain why in this article he ignores the fact that most governments perceive cryptocurrencies as a direct threat to their own currency, and as a result, they try to combat them. Some try to ban crypto, while others refrain from establishing a clear regulatory framework. This reason alone could explain why cryptocurrencies still have yet to become part of our everyday life.Related: Authorities are looking to close the gap on unhosted walletsKrugman goes on with the weak argument that he has never heard a clear answer for the simple question: What is cryptocurrency and/or blockchain good for?First, I am puzzled by this oxymoron because cryptocurrency is a use case of blockchain, and also because Satoshi gave a very clear answer in 2008 to this question: Bitcoin is here to replace central bank fiat money. I am sure Krugman has had the chance to discuss this with the most knowledgeable, intelligent blockchain and crypto experts out there.I will admit that other use cases for blockchain (other than finance) are not easy to come by, and it could have been that he was not convinced by the potential that perfect transparency and inclusion, provided by blockchain, could have on better supply chain management, financial and aid funds control, fighting corruption through cleaner public procurement platforms, eliminating elite capture, fighting the proliferation of minors’ abusive imagery, and more. Yet, I cannot comprehend how Krugman can overlook cryptocurrencies’ impact on the people living under crumbling economies, such as in Venezuela, or their potential to save billions of dollars in migrants’ remittance fees.Instead, Krugman suggests that cryptocurrencies may just be the most current Ponzi scheme, spiced with “technobabble” and “libertarian derp,” while adding in the same breath that gold is too. In fact, Krugman sees the two as similar: “Gold, after all, suffers from pretty much the same problems as Bitcoin.” In many circles, Bitcoin is referred to as “digital gold.” Funnily enough, I cannot think of a better supporting argument that crypto believers could have hoped for, other than Krugman’s quote. He later glorifies gold’s “mystique” and “semi-sacred status,” claiming that cryptocurrencies may never get to that. Maybe he is right; however, he does not explain how he reached this interesting conclusion. In essence, this argument is the equivalent of knowing for a fact that chocolate ice cream tastes better than vanilla.Related: Did Bitcoin prove itself to be a reliable store of value in 2020? Experts answerLast but not least, I want to address Krugman and others’ repeated argument that Bitcoin is closely associated with illegal activities, and whose Pavlovian conditioning to cryptocurrencies summons ransomware, drug trafficking and money laundering.Yes, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been, and still are, used by bad actors to finance their illegal activities. But by the way, so are cash, gold and bank accounts. In another piece, I explain how Bitcoin actually is better suited than fiat to help law enforcement prevent illegal financial activities.Allow me to go out on a limb and say: Most owners or users of cryptocurrencies are not criminals. They are law-abiding citizens, wherever on the globe they may be. It is the lack of clear regulations that exacerbates issues. Not only does the lack of regulation fail to block all the legal loopholes that bad actors exploit, but it also prevents most users from having clear guidance as to what they can and cannot do, thus putting everybody in the same bucket as alleged criminals. In my opinion, regulators must react faster and regulate crypto markets sooner rather than later. Some work hard to reach that goal, but most of them are not doing enough.While Krugman and I hold differing views on Bitcoin, blockchain and their value to the world, we do agree on one thing: They are here to stay. The more these topics are discussed and shared regardless of different opinions, the more people are exposed to the matter, learn about it and form their independent opinions.This is how concepts evolve. Actually, the fact that such a highly respected Nobel Prize recipient and economist wrote an opinion column about Bitcoin in one of the world’s most popular newspapers — twice already — proves the impact that cryptocurrencies have on our lives, and may have on our future. For us true believers, the potential impact and good that this technology can create in the future is reason enough to hold.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

604,"Bitcoin (BTC) hodlers who want to earn BTC tax-free will get help to stay in El Salvador, the country's president has said.In a tweet on Monday, President Nayib Bukele said that his government would ""help"" settle foreign workers.The announcement is one of many that continue to come informally from Bukele, now famous for attempting to put El Salvador on a form of ""Bitcoin standard.""At last week's Bitcoin 2021 confernce in Miami, he told the audience in a prerecorded video message that he would send a bill to lawmakers demanding that Bitcoin be made legal tender. Welcome to the future #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/j30vcZVXvJNow, as part of social media engagement with well-known cryptocurrency figures, Bukele suggested that those wishing to travel to work in El Salvador would get official support. Once made legal tender, Bitcoin income would not face capital gains tax.""We’ll help with this,"" he replied while debating the topic with podcast host Stephan Livera.Tu tienes Bitcoin? tu tienes residencia en el Salvador yo en cualquier momento caigo ... https://t.co/drpnIQ1lAjIn a separate tweet came promises of ""immediate permanent residence for crypto entrepreneurs,"" a move that spurred interest from figures such as Tron CEO Justin Sun and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, among others.As Cointelegraph reported, meanwhile, El Salvador's plan has already seen Paraguay make a similar move.Likewise using Twitter as a venue for publicizing still unofficial government plans, one congressperson hinted that a deal involving PayPal would shortly be announced by Asuncion.This likewise received a warm reception.""Now Paraguay? The sovereign level game theory starting to take shape just like many have been talking about for years,"" podcast host Preston Pysh responded. Criticism has nonetheless come mixed with concern for El Salvador. The political structure of the country has worried some, while others believe that there would be international backlash over a Bitcoin standard. Bukele, however, has already pledged to rise above external pressure.""Some powerful interests will try to make this historical #Bitcoin move fail,"" he wrote.Plan B Passport, a dedicated service helping Bitcoin owners move to more appealing jurisdictions such as Portugal, has yet to add El Salvador to its list of destinations."
605,"Emerging markets appear to be punching above their weight when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC) investment, offering further evidence of growing worldwide adoption, according to a new report from cryptocurrency analytics firm Chainalysis. A geographic analysis of realized Bitcoin gains revealed that investors in the United States generated $4.1 billion in returns last year, which is more than three times higher than second-ranked China, Chainalysis said. Although economic stalwarts such as Japan, the United Kingdom and Germany were near the top of the list, several countries are investing a lot more in Bitcoin relative to traditional economic metrics like gross domestic product.In other words, GDP doesn’t seem to be a strong indicator of who is generating higher return on investment in Bitcoin. A standout case is Vietnam, a country that ranks 53rd in GDP but 13th when it comes to realized Bitcoin gains. The East Asian country’s sharp pivot from a centrally planned economy to one embracing market reforms has allowed it to slash its poverty rate from over 70% to below 6% since 2002, according to the World Bank.Chainalysis also drew attention to the Czech Republic, Turkey and Spain, which rank 54th, 25th and 19th in GDP, respectively, but all fall within the top 20 in terms of realized Bitcoin gains.The 2020–2021 Bitcoin bull market began in October of last year, as the price had increased from around $11,000 to over $29,000 by Dec. 31. Bitcoin’s price would eventually peak near $65,000 in April before undergoing a sharp correction.Chainalysis was able to extrapolate country-specific data by analyzing location-based web traffic on various cryptocurrency exchanges. Cointelegraph asked the analytics firm how it was able to account for the potential presence of VPN usage by exchange users. While Chainalysis acknowledged the limitations, the company stood by its rigorous analysis of transaction data, stating:The report echoes what many crypto enthusiasts have been saying all along — Bitcoin gives investors in emerging markets unfettered access to a high-performing asset. This is especially important in regions that are facing high inflation and stricter government controls over bank deposits and withdrawals."
606,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls should brace for a potential onslaught from bears as the number of margined short positions on Bitfinex jumps by a little over 378%.Known to most by the ticker BTCUSD Shorts, the dataset records the number of bearish positions in the Bitcoin market. In simple terms, traders borrow funds from Bitfinex — their broker — to trade bet on bearish outcomes for the instrument BTC/USD. Meanwhile, the value of opened short positions is measured in BTC.The number of short margined positions on Bitfinex reached an intraday high of 6,468.2202 BTC this Monday, up more than 378% from its previous session’s low at 1,351.72 BTC.The spike prompted some analysts to alarm about a potential price crash in the Bitcoin spot market primarily because a similar wild BTCUSD Shorts uptrend at the beginning of last month had led the BTC/USD exchange rate down by almost $13,000 on May 19.For instance, independent market researcher Fomocap tweeted a chart that showed a visible correlation between Bitcoin spot rates and its margined short positions. The analyst highlighted two instances to note that two metrics moved inversely with some lag.His first example showed that on May 25, BTCUSD Shorts dropped lower, which was later led to a price rally in Bitcoin spot markets.The second example showed Bitcoin spot prices crashing after a spike in BTCUSD Shorts.EBlockChain, a TradingView contributor, said earlier on Monday that BTCUSD Shorts exceeding 200% and above is a “strong indication” of an imminent dump in Bitcoin spot markets. The analyst added:The boldly bearish statements for Bitcoin also came as its margin-longed positions rose steadily.BTCUSD Longs, another Bitfinex dataset that records the number of bullish margin positions, surged to as high as 44,538.6579 BTC on Monday. So, it appears, Bitcoin’s long exposure remained higher than short exposure in totality, illustrating that, to traders, the direction of the least risk was to the upside.But a sudden drop in Bitcoin spot prices could also lead leveraged long holders to dump their BTCUSD positions, which, in turn, incites further selling. Such an event is called “long squeeze.” May 19’s price crash, for example, had liquidated about $7.5 billion of long-leveraged positions across the cryptocurrency derivatives market.Jacob Canfield, a crypto trader, provided an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin following the May crash. Last week, the analyst stated that Bitcoin has already dropped by more than 40% following its May long squeeze — and now there is a lesser probability of facing another significant bearish move.After a long squeeze and liquidity is taken to the downside.

Liquidity is usually engineered to the upside and shorts get trapped thinking more downside is coming.

We already got 40% drop.

Now it’s bears turn to get rekt again.Meanwhile, the cost to fund long positions in the Bitcoin derivatives market remained mostly below zero following the May 19 crash. Negative funding rates cause bearish traders to pay fees every eight hours. The situation encourages market makers and arbitrage desks to buy inverse swaps — or perpetual contracts — as they simultaneously unload their futures monthly contracts.Analysts typically interpret negative funding rates as a buy indicator because they create incentives for buyers and squeeze short-sellers. Meanwhile, the funding rates become neutral as soon as shorts close their positions.Bitcoin’s ongoing consolidation move has many traders point out the possible formation of a bearish pennant structure.Not a big fan of this structure. $BTC pic.twitter.com/yO8bG66ZzrIn retrospect, bearish pennants are downside continuation indicators — i.e., their setup typically involves the asset breaking out of the range and continuing in the direction of its previous trend. For example, Bitcoin dropped from around $65,000 to $30,000 before forming the pennant. Therefore, its likelihood of continuing lower appears higher based on technical structures alone.Meanwhile, one bullish backstop for Bitcoin remains fears of higher inflation. This week, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics will release May’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The data will set the future tone for the Federal Reserve’s expansionary monetary policies, including near-zero lending rates and infinite bond-buying programs.Economists forecast that the CPI will rise to 4.7% for May compared to 4.2% in April.More evidence dropped in about investors’ intention to hold Bitcoin than to trade/liquidate it for other assets. For example, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode reported a decline in net exchange flows involving Bitcoin.Meanwhile, its rival CryptoQuant highlighted a significant drop in volume across the Bitcoin blockchain, hinting at a similar holding outlook via its “BTC: Active Address Count” metric.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

607,"European digital asset manager CoinShares is expanding the reach of its physically backed exchange-traded product (ETP) portfolio with a new listing in Germany.According to an announcement on Monday, CoinShares Physical Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) ETPs have cross-listed on major German exchange Deutsche Boerse Xetra.The digital asset manager started the year by launching a Bitcoin ETP named CoinShares Physical Bitcoin (BITC) in January. Listed on Switzerland’s SIX Swiss Exchange, each ETP is physically backed by 0.001 Bitcoin.Since then, the CoinShares Physical platform has launched Ether and Litecoin ETPs. CoinShares Physical Ether (ETHE) was backed with 0.03 ETH at launch, while CoinShares Physical Litecoin (LITE) was backed with 0.2 LTC.CoinShares chief revenue officer Frank Spiteri said that the CoinShares Physical platform now has over $380 million in assets under management and operates in 11 countries.The listing of CoinShares Physical Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin ETPs on Boerse Xetra follows approval from regulators to distribute the ETPs across the European Union, the announcement reads.CoinShares’ passporting to Germany enabled CoinShares Physical ETPs’ entrance into Germany, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, France, Denmark, Finland and Norway.“Focussing on market demand, we launched earlier this year, our institutional platform CoinShares Physical first in Switzerland and now in Europe,” CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti said. The Boerse Xetra listing offers European institutional investors an entry point into digital assets with the credibility of CoinShares, he added.Deutsche Boerse Xetra is no stranger to cryptocurrency ETPs. Last year, London-based ETC Group announced the listing of its Bitcoin Exchange Traded Crypto (BTCE) on the exchange. It was also one of two European exchanges along with SIX to list New York-based asset manager WisdomTree’s physically backed Ether ETP."
608,"United States lawmakers have deliberated on the prospect of banning cryptocurrencies as a solution to the ransomware attacks that have befallen U.S. institutions in the past month, and opinions appear to be mixed.The largest fuel pipeline in America was brought to a halt in early May when hackers infected the computer networks of Colonial Pipeline. Food packing company JBS was hit with a similar attack. Colonial Pipeline has since paid a reported $4.4 million in ransom.Senator Mark Warner addressed the matter during NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday, where it was put to him by reporter Chuck Todd that banning cryptocurrencies entirely could curb the growing trend where cyberattackers demand ransom in Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.Warner disagreed that crypto should be banned entirely, adding that good things had come out of distributed ledger technology but that its dark underbelly was now being exposed.“I’ve got a lot of questions about crypto. There were some good things coming out of distributed ledger technology, but we are now seeing some of the dark underbelly [...] and that’s why I’m focusing more on transparency,” he said.Warner claimed certain cryptocurrency “systems” could already be breached by authorities if they so desired. However, he said stopping the technology would simply redirect criminals toward different technologies.“The truth is there are ways that we can break through some of these systems, but [...] if there’s not some transparency of that payment, the bad guys will simply find another way to hide it,” said Warner.Senator Roy Blunt suggested cryptocurrency shouldn’t be left to run behind the scenes of criminal activities, arguing that cryptocurrency had become the main tool of ransomware attackers, owing to its untraceable nature and ease of use.“We have a lot of cash requirements in our country, but we haven’t figured out in the country or in the world how to trace cryptocurrency. So, one, fairly easy to do. People almost always pay the ransom. There are very few consequences. And you can’t trace the ransomware — the ransom payment of choice now. And we’ve got to do a better job here,” said Blunt."
609,"Bitcoin (BTC) begins another week below $40,000 — but with two major new landmarks under its belt.After falling over continued FUD from China over the weekend, Bitcoin adoption has also seen an unexpected first — from El Salvador and Paraguay.With the world potentially about to greet its first two “Bitcoin nations” in history, there’s plenty to be bullish about, but can BTC price action catch up?Cointelegraph takes a look at five things that may change the status quo in BTC/USD over the coming days.A cursory look at the wider macro climate delivers an interesting mixture for Bitcoin traders and hodlers.Inflation is still the talk of the town in the United States, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen revealing that she would be in favor of higher rates.Speaking to Bloomberg over the weekend, Yellen voiced support for President Joe Biden’s latest giant spending package and argued that this should be given credence even if it resulted in inflation.“If we ended up with a slightly higher interest rate environment, it would actually be a plus for society’s point of view and the Fed’s point of view,” she told the publication.Higher interest rates tend to improve Bitcoin’s appeal as a deflationary asset, but coming hand in hand with them is a surging U.S. dollar this month — something that traditionally pressures BTC/USD.After bouncing off 90, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) is now busy making up lost ground, bucking a downtrend that began in mid-March.Within Bitcoin, the word on everyone’s lips is “El Salvador.”After payments gateway Strike began making serious inroads in the country, President Nayib Bukele formally announced that he would send a bill to parliament to make Bitcoin legal tender.Should it succeed, El Salvador would be the first nation on Earth to do so, effectively adopting something akin to a “Bitcoin standard.”Bukele confirmed his plans during a video address at last week’s Bitcoin Conference 2021 event in Miami, at which Strike CEO Jack Mallers outlined the plans.Markets, however, were practically unmoved by the revelation — something that continued as a congress member from Paraguay took to social media to hint at plans for Bitcoin integration in a second world economy.“As I was saying a long time ago, our country needs to advance hand in hand with the new generation. The moment has come — our moment,” Carlitos Rejala tweeted on Monday.Rejala additionally thanked Bukele for his “example.”As Cointelegraph reported, however, El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin may come at a price. Reacting, commentators touched on Bukele’s authoritarian leadership, along with potential teething troubles resulting from an economy that uses the U.S. dollar doing so.For Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Avanti Bank, there may be bigger forces at play.“Bitcoin is hacking dictatorships, just like it’s hacking big tech,” she wrote in one of many tweets about the move.Look at immediate price action, and anyone would be forgiven for having cold feet over Bitcoin on Monday.For all the excitement of the conference, BTC/USD is firmly rangebound and minus a run of higher highs and higher lows, which could signal a breakout.Recent attempts at doing so — by escaping a narrowing “compression” wedge where volatility trends to almost zero — have all stalled.At the time of writing, Bitcoin traded at just above $36,000.With funding rates lessening, positive signs were just about visible in some areas of the market, but others are already sounding the alarm.Causing concern are short trades on major exchange Bitfinex. As popular Twitter account Fomocap noted on Monday, a rise in shorts has historically coincided with major volatility — usually to the downside.“Bitfinex sudden move in shorts always means something. From Nov 25 drop to May 19 rise,” he warned.This would cement existing fears that Bitcoin is not yet done with its bearish retreat. Opinion is split, as Cointelegraph reported — some are waiting for a return to $20,000, while others are convinced that such levels are out of reach for good.Bitcoin’s pain could yet be altcoins’ gain.With some cryptocurrencies scoring sustained upside despite a declining crypto market capitalization, hopes remain that an opportunist “alt season” can still emerge.Of particular interest this week is Ether (ETH), which against Bitcoin is approaching its recent local highs of 0.081 from last month.Currently at 0.076, ETH/BTC could be primed for a further breakout. Kyle Davies, CEO of Three Arrows Capital, even went as far as to describe the incoming move as “parabolic.”“If we hit .2 without making usd all time highs on both assets I’m just gonna not bother with crypto anymore,” Blockfolio’s UpOnly chat show host Cobie replied, capturing the general sense of frustration with current price action among traders.ETH/BTC hit its all-time high of 0.123 in early 2018 and has since failed to approach those levels again.On Monday, the majority of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap saw modest gains as Bitcoin dithered, while some outperformed, including Solana (SOL) with 10% returns and Tezos (XTZ) with 12%.“Could see some more upside here especially if Eth/BTC holds,” trader Josh Rager forecast on Sunday about SOL’s prospects.Bitcoin’s hash rate is showing signs of recovering, with a modest uptick from 125 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 134 EH/s in recent days.Difficulty is still due to decrease by around 8% at the next automated readjustment in five days’ time, compensating for a miner shake-up that accompanied recent volatility.Nonetheless, once-confident miners who had held through the dip decreased their holdings en masse last week, data shows.As noted by analyst William Clemente III, miner balances are down by 5,000 BTC compared to one week ago — a major turnaround.On June 3, 3,012 BTC left largest mining pool Poolin in what was the largest single outflow of 2021. Another 2,501 BTC moved a day later.Commenting, however, analyst Lex Moskovski acknowledged that the funds may not have ended up being sold.“This isn’t a sign for selling even if this day sees 3x of the outflows like this,” he tweeted."
610,"China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies has reportedly spread to social media. Weibo, China’s Twitter-like microblogging service with over 530 million monthly active users, has reportedly suspended several popular Bitcoin- (BTC) and crypto-related content creators on the platform.According to local reports, at least a dozen crypto influencers on Weibo were unable to use their accounts on Saturday. Weibo greeted other users who visited suspended accounts with a message saying the banned accounts violated Weibo guidelines and “relevant laws and regulations.”A Weibo user nicknamed ""Woman Dr. bitcoin Mini,"" who saw her account was blocked on Saturday, called Weibo’s action a judgment day for crypto influencers.Winston Ma, a New York University law school adjunct professor and former China Investment Corporation managing director, said, “The Chinese government makes it clear that no Chinese version of Elon Musk can exist in the Chinese crypto market.”The academic was alluding to Musk's controversial influence over cryptocurrency markets on social media. Ma also expects China’s supreme court to soon publish a judicial interpretation that may link crypto mining and trading businesses with China’s body of criminal law, according to reports.The government’s negative stance on crypto has echoed across all parts of the industry in China. After Beijing authorities started investigating crypto mining data centers’ energy consumption in April, Bitcoin mining became a risky operation in the country. Major miners have since announced that they will end their operations in the nation.Last week, financial regulators in China’s Hainan province warned citizens about illegal fundraising campaigns that use digital currency or blockchain as promotion material, stating that illicit token issuance and financing activities are forbidden.Cointelegraph reached out to Weibo for comment and will update this article should it respond."
611,"In October 2014, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology launched the MIT Bitcoin Project, an initiative that sought to give away $500,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) to its undergraduate students.Students were able to claim $100 worth of BTC in exchange for filling out a survey, equating to roughly 0.3 BTC at the time. The project was spearheaded by students Jeremy Rubin and Dan Elitzer, who raised $500,000 from university alumni and representatives of the Bitcoin community.The project was intended to encourage exploration into digital assets and foster the campus as a global hub for crypto research.With 3,100 students capitalizing on the offer and close to $200,000 worth of Bitcoin going unclaimed at the time, the university distributed roughly $33.8 million worth of BTC at current prices.While many of the students presumably spent their freely obtained Bitcoin stash, with the MIT coop bookstore launching support for BTC as payment for textbooks, school supplies and other MIT merchandise from September 2014, Bloomberg spoke to one student who still holds the Bitcoin MIT gave her seven years ago.Despite the value of 0.3 Bitcoin falling from $19,500 in mid-April to nearly $11,000 today, MIT alumni Mary Spanjers described her experience with cryptocurrency as “truly remarkable,” adding:Bloomberg also caught up with other MIT alumni who had quickly spent their Bitcoin, with several participants lamenting they had spent it on groceries or restaurants, including a nearby sushi joint that accepted Bitcoin as payment. Online forums suggest other students spent their crypto on beer, shoes and other trivial expenditures.Christian Catalini, an MIT associate professor who oversaw the Bitcoin Project, estimates that 10% of participating students had cashed out their BTC within two weeks, while 25% had exited as of the project’s completion in mid-2017."
612,"Asset manager Ruffer has taken more than $1 billion in profit from a $600 million Bitcoin investment it made in November 2020.Speaking to The Times, Hamish Baillie, investment director at the London-based asset management firm, revealed that Ruffer closed out its Bitcoin (BTC) position for more than $1.1 billion in profit during April:Baillie claimed that Ruffer became one of the first fund managers to buy BTC in what was a rare short-term investment for the company. At the time of the investment, Bitcoin’s price had cleared $15,000 and was pushing up to test the then-all-time highs near $20,000 that had been set in 2017.The investment director attributed Bitcoin’s late-2020 parabolic price rally to the pandemic lockdown and stimulus payouts in the United States. He said the company sold its holdings partly because younger investors would not be spending as much time trading crypto now that lockdowns are ending.The firm has moved the profits it made on the BTC trade into other “protective” assets such as inflation-linked government bonds. However, Baillie is confident that major financial institutions, including Ruffer and Goldman Sachs, will continue to buy Bitcoin, stating that another purchase is “certainly not off the menu”:Ruffer is not the only large financial institution that has been dabbling in crypto, with data from Bitcoin Treasuries suggesting that 36 publicly traded companies currently hold BTC on their balance sheet.Only six, or 16%, of publicly traded firms invested in Bitcoin are currently down on their position, including Nexon, Meitu and Seetee. The top three holders — MicroStrategy, Tesla and Square — are sitting on $5.2 billion worth of BTC between them."
613,"Research has revealed that one in five Australians believe that crypto is the key to homeownership as confidence in traditional savings dwindles.The survey, conducted by cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, found that an increasing number of young Australians are becoming disheartened by traditional investment options. Almost one-quarter of those surveyed expressed concern that the value of money in traditional cash savings is decreasing.The research saw partner YouGov queru 1,027 Australians aged 18 years and older online from May 3 until May 5. The data was weighted by age, gender and region to reflect the latest population estimates from the Ausralian Bureau of Statistics.The study found that 22% of the Australians surveyed believe investing in cryptocurrency is an easier way to save for a mortgage deposit than storing fiat in a bank account or other traditional savings methods.Nearly 40% of Millennials — respondents born between the early 1980s and the mid-to-late-1990s — said that crypto assets are a sound alternative to buying an investment property. Further, 31% of Generation X participants — Australians born between the mid-1960s to early 1980s — also believe crypto assets are better investments than real estate, while only 24% of Generation Z respondents — those born between the late 1990s and 2010 — echoed this sentiment.Almost half of the baby boomers surveyed — those born between the mid-1940s and mid-1960s — have not invested in crypto, citing volatility concerns.One in five survey participants either currently own or have previously owned crypto assets, while 14% stated they currently hold an active crypto portfolio. Nearly 85% of respondents who already own crypto assets plan to buy more.Kraken Australia managing director Jonathon Miller commented that while lagging behind the United States in terms of adoption, Australia is a rapidly growing market for crypto assets that is largely driven by demand from millennials:He added that it is the younger Australians who are changing the dynamic and expects the broader market to come around to the idea of investing in digital assets.Miller also emphasized the need for greater crypto education in Australia, and it looks like more is needed. Last month, Cointelegraph reported that more than half of Australian respondents from a different survey think Elon Musk invented Bitcoin."
614,"It’s the classic Anonymous modus operandi: a monologue worthy of a super villain, a perceived attack on an individual right or public good, some guy in a Guy Fawkes mask, and a whole lot of fizzbang-wowie video effects and voice distortion. But as the hacktivist collective takes aim at a new target in Elon Musk, the latest “expect us” threat prompts the question: who cares?Yesterday, a video purportedly from the Anonymous collective warned that there is now a joint intelligence working against him:Oh fuckhttps://t.co/f8A4baYgWUThe monologue was meandering, noting that “your fanboys overlook these issues because they are focused on the potential good that your projects can bring to the world,” taking aim at Musk’s background as the heir to a south African mining company, and accusing him of attempting to “create a Bitcoin Mining Council was rightly seen as an attempt to centralize the industry and take it under your control.”What really attracted the ire of this particular group, however, is that smaller fry investors may have been negatively impacted by Musk’s recent Twitter shenanigans.“Reading from the comments on your Twitter posts, it seems that the games you have played with the crypto markets have destroyed lives. Millions of retail investors were really counting on their crypto gains to improve their lives,” the masked man grumbles.Hey @elonmusk, I just met Martin, a Lyft driver in Miami, who told me he lost almost $10,000 investing in Dogecoin - which he got into because of your Twitter account. Maybe it's time to calm down.Anonymous is hardly the only party to have taken issue with Musk’s cynical Tweeting as of late, but it’s unclear if they can do something about it. The group’s power seems to have waned in recent years. Their peak arguably came during Project Chanology, an effort aimed at delegitimizing and degrading the influence of the Church of Scientology. They attacked websites, published secret information, and even sent a near-naked man covered in pubic hair and vaseline to trash a Church location. Bless you, Agent Pubit.In recent years, their successes have been fewer while their threats have been many. Recent targets include the government of Nigeria, the Minneapolis police department, and the prison system of Thailand. In all instances, it’s unclear what, if any, battles they managed to win.The efficacy or legitimacy of Anonymous' efforts are almost irrelevant, however. Anonymous and blockchain ideology are two overlapping, but ultimately separate intellectual movements, and incidents like this video highlight the differences between the two.Bitcoin was founded by a pseudonymous individual or collective named Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi chose to step away from his creation, freeing the tech of statements like Anonymous'. Bitcoin doesn't need anyone's help; it's an elegantly designed network which will all but certainly outlast Elon Musk, and it may even outlast all memory of his achievements.This is how cypherpunks fight: with code, not cosplay. Anonymous, respectfully, we're good."
615,"When an asset enters a bear phase and the headlines are negative, analysts project further downside, and the sentiment shifts from optimism to pure gloom and doom. This results in panic gripped traders dumping their positions near the bottom of the downtrend instead of buying. How can traders go against the herd and build the courage to buy in a bear market? It is not easy because if they purchase too early, the position may quickly turn into a loss. However, if they wait for too long, they may miss the early part of the rally.Although pulling the trigger during a bear phase is difficult, the relative strength index (RSI) indicator can identify market bottoms and favorable risk to reward scenarios.Let’s review a few examples of when to buy in a bear market.Bitcoin (BTC) topped out close to $20,000 in December 2017 and started a long gut-wrenching bear market that bottomed out near $3,300 in December 2018. During this period, the RSI entered the oversold territory (a reading below 30) on five occasions (marked as ellipses on the chart).In the first four instances, the RSI dipped close to or just below the 30 level but during the fifth time, the RSI dropped to 10.50. This is a sign of capitulation where traders who had been buying pre-empting a bottom or had held their positions in the bear market succumbed to fear and purged their holdings.Usually, long bear markets end after prolonged periods of fear-based selling. Smart traders wait for these opportunities and buy when the markets are deeply oversold, like when the RSI below 20.Fast forward to 2019 and 2020 when the RSI dipped close to 20 on two occasions and dropped to 15.04 on March 12, 2020.The first instance when the pair dropped to 19.60 on Sep. 26, 2019, turned out to be a losing trade because the price made a new local low weeks later on Oct. 23, 2019. This shows that traders should be ready to close their positions when the stops hit because if they don’t do that, the losses may keep growing.On Nov. 24, 2019, the RSI dropped to 22.32, just above the 20 level. For traders who keep a very tight stop, this would have also turned out to be a losing trade with the drop on Dec. 18, 2019. However, these were all small losses, which would not make a dent to the portfolio unless traders were using heavy leverage.The RSI plunged to 15.04 on March 12, 2020, and traders who were brave enough to buy after this drop would have made outsized gains had they held onto their positions during the bull phase, which topped out at $64,854 on April 14, 2021. This shows how after two losing purchases, traders eventually hit the jackpot using the RSI signal.During Ether’s (ETH) bear phase in 2018, there were four instances when the RSI dipped below or came close to the 20 level. The first opportunity offered a strong return to traders but the other two instances turned out to be losers.To avoid whipsaws, traders may add extra filters to keep them out of losing trades. One simple example could be that instead of buying just after the RSI drops below 20, traders may wait for the price to close above the 20-day exponential moving average for three successive days before purchasing.As seen in the chart above, the signal to buy in April 2018 triggered as the ETH/USDT pair rose above the 20-day EMA after dropping below the 20 level on the RSI. This trade turned out to be profitable as the pair witnessed a sharp up-move.The next buy signal in August did not meet the criteria because the price did not rise above the 20-day EMA for three consecutive days. The third trade in September would have turned into a minor loss but the one in November would have made a huge profit.Another important tool that can help warn traders of a possible trend reversal is a bullish divergence. This happens when the price continues to fall but the RSI makes higher lows, indicating the bearish momentum could be weakening.Litecoin (LTC) shows the formation of two bullish divergences during the 2018 bear phase. The first divergence that formed from August to September of 2018 turned out to be a false signal because the price did not rise above the swing high.However, the second bullish divergence from November to December of 2018 turned out to be a profitable signal right at the bottom, which was followed by a sharp rise within the next few days.Another example of a slightly longer bullish divergence can be seen in Ethereum Classic (ETC) from September to December 2019. During the period, the price made lower lows but the RSI formed higher lows. The ETC/USDT pair surged in the next few days after it broke above the swing high.VeChain (VET) also showed the formation of a bullish divergence from September 2020 to October 2020, which was followed by a huge bull run. This shows the bullish divergence is a useful tool, which if used wisely can benefit the traders immensely.Bear markets offer the opportunity to buy an asset at a significant discount but it is not easy to purchase when everyone is selling and the sentiment is negative.However, traders who use the RSI can develop an edge. An extremely oversold reading on the RSI is a sign of capitulation, which generally marks the end of a bear phase. This strategy can help traders pull the trigger when it matters.Sometimes, the RSI may give false signals, hence, traders can use additional filters like daily closes above the 20- and 50-day moving average to avoid whipsaw trades. Spotting bullish divergences can also alert traders that a downtrend may be ending.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

616,"While it was billed as the “one of the biggest announcements in Bitcoin's history,” the market seems to be puzzling over the landmark reveal that El Salvador’s sitting President will be submitting legislation to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. In a presentation at Bitcoin 2021 from Jack Mallers, CEO of Zap — developers of a previously low-profile Lightning Network wallet app named Strike — Mallers showed a short video from Salvadorian president Nayib Bukele where the leader of the 104th largest global economy announced the historic legislation. Strike currently has a 3.2 out of 5 star rating on the Google Play store.“Next week, I will send to Congress a bill that makes Bitcoin legal money,” Bukele said in the video.Welcome to the future #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/j30vcZVXvJBukele, who has been characterized as a strongman and an autocrat, consolidated his power last month by firing five judges as well as the country’s attorney general. A recent Reddit thread from a self-professed Salvadorian framed the move as one that will be popular both with Bukele’s supermajority party, as well as with the general populace. The move has been long-awaited in Bitcoin circles, with some speculating that nation-states would come to accept, transact in, and hold the world's largest digital asset as part of treasury reserves.A Tweet thread from Bitcoin advocate Caitlyn Long noted that it may be a “back door” way for banks to handle and custody BTC:1/ THREAD ABOUT A HISTORIC DAY in #bitcoin: #ElSalvador president publicly announced support for legislation to make #BTC legal tender. *IF* it does become law, it wld have many secondary effects. Steel yourselves bc a big fight on this probably coming thohttps://t.co/BrrNxaLzpZWhile the announcement led to widespread elation at the conference, the market response has been tepid. BTC is effectively flat on a 24 hour basis, and down 3.5% on a 14-day basis. Part of the muted response may be due in part to the exact nature of the announcement being unclear. A self-described hacker on Twitter noted that Strike is not trustless and is censorable, meaning that this implementation of BTC as legal tender won't be the anarcho-capitalist utopia some hodlers long for.Tried installing strike, the app that will be used in El Salvador to pay with bitcoin.

617,"When the sentiment in the market turns bearish, every bit of negative news, however insignificant, pulls the price down as traders panic sell. This is what happened after China’s social media giant, Weibo, suspended a number of crypto-related accounts and triggered fears that a wider crackdown could occur.In other news, a note from Goldman Sachs said their meetings with 25 chief investment officers of long-only and hedge funds revealed Bitcoin (BTC) as the least favorite asset for investment.While the news may be negative in the short term, it is unlikely to change the long-term story of Bitcoin. As the price corrects, several institutional investors are likely to consider crypto investments to hedge their portfolio against the possible surge in inflation in the United States.From the perspective of most traders, Bitcoin's current decline continues to represent a buying opportunity for the longer term. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the next few days.Bitcoin turned down from the 20-day exponential moving average ($39,127) on June 3 but is finding support near the trendline of the triangle. This shows that bulls are buying on dips, and bears are selling on rallies.The next trending move is likely to start after the price escapes from the triangle. If the bulls propel and sustain the price above the resistance line, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($47,198) and then to the pattern target at $52,622.90.On the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the trendline of the triangle, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could result in a drop to the $30,000 to $28,000 support zone.If this zone cracks, the selling could intensify as several traders who bought recently may exit their positions. That may pull the price down to $20,000.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have flattened out, and the relative strength index (RSI) is oscillating roughly between 40 and 60, indicating an equilibrium between buyers and sellers.However, this state of uncertainty is unlikely to continue for long and the price is likely to break above or below the triangle in the next few days. If the price breaks out and sustains above the triangle, it will suggest the setup acted as a reversal pattern.Conversely, if the price breaks below the triangle, it will suggest that the current consolidation was a temporary halt in a strong downtrend. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, hence traders may wait for the break to happen before considering fresh positions.Ether (ETH) turned down from the 50-day SMA ($2.908) on June 4 and re-entered the symmetrical triangle. However, the positive thing is that bulls did not give up much ground, indicating strong buying near $2,550.If the buyers drive the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair may again challenge the 50-day SMA. A breakout and close above this resistance could clear the path for a move to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,362.72.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the 50-day SMA once again, it will suggest that bears are defending the resistance aggressively. A break below $2,550 could pull the price down to the support line of the triangle. A break below the triangle will be the first indication that the bears are back in the driver’s seat.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $2,906. If that happens, the pair could rally to $3,600 and then to the pattern target at $4,083.26.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the trendline of the triangle. The bears will then try to pull the price down to $2,200 and then to the critical support at $1,728.74.Cardano (ADA) has been stuck in a large range between $1.94 and $1 for the past few days. The altcoin turned down from the resistance on the range on June 4 and has dropped to the moving averages.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the zone between the 20-day EMA ($1.66) and the 50-day SMA ($1.55). If the price rebounds off the current levels, it will suggest the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying the dips to the moving averages.A breakout and close above $1.94 will indicate the bulls are back in the driver’s seat. If the price sustains above this level, the ADA/USDT pair could retest the all-time high at $2.47. A break above this resistance will indicate the start of the next leg of the uptrend.This positive view will invalidate if the pair turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA. The bears will then try to pull the price down to the $1.33 to $1.22 support zone.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $1.94. This bullish setup has a target objective at $2.88. However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash to the target because the bears may mount a stiff resistance at the current all-time high at $2.47.The 20-EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a possible drop to the trendline of the triangle. A break below this support will invalidate the bullish setup and that may result in a drop to $1.36 and then to $1.The bears are attempting to stall Solana’s (SOL) relief rally at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $43.38. However, the sellers haven’t been able to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($36.39), which indicates the sentiment has turned positive.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for SOL on June 1, before the rally picked up momentum..The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen from the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for SOL flipped green on June 1 when the price was close to $32.10.The VORTECS™ Score has consistently remained in the green since then and the price of SOL has rallied to $43.33 today, recording a 35% gain in five days. This shows how the VORTECS™ Score gave an early indication of a counter trend rally even as other tools would have been bearish.The SOL/USDT pair rebounded off the 20-day EMA on June 4 and has bounced off the 50-day SMA ($39.42) today. This suggests the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.If buyers drive the price above $43.38, it will indicate the downtrend is over. The pair could then rally to the 78.6% retracement level at $49.97 and then to the all-time high at $58.38. The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, suggesting the buyers have the upper hand.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and slumps below the trendline. The pair could then decline to $25.58 and later to $21.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have turned up and the RSI is trading in the positive territory, suggesting the bulls are making a comeback. The up-move may pick up momentum if buyers thrust the price above $43.38.Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks the 20-EMA, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. The pair could then drop to the 50-SMA and then to the trendline. A break below the trendline will indicate that bears are back in the game.THETA is trading inside a descending channel. The bulls attempted to push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the channel on June 4 and 5 but failed. This suggests the bears are defending this resistance aggressively.However, the 20-day EMA ($8.19) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating the bulls have a slight advantage. If the THETA/USDT pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the buyers will make one more attempt to propel the price above the channel.If they succeed, it will suggest the downtrend could be over. The pair could then start an up-move to $13 and later to the all-time high at $15.88. This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could result in a decline to $6.The 4-hour chart shows the pair has turned down from the resistance line of the channel on two occasions. However, the bears have not been able to sink and sustain the price below the 20-EMA, indicating demand at lower levels.If the pair rebounds off the current level, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the channel. If they manage to do that, the next leg of the uptrend may begin.On the other hand, if the price breaks below the 20-EMA, the pair could slide down to the 50-SMA. A break below this support will suggest the start of a deeper correction.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

618,"While writing the world's most famous white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto defined the Bitcoin (BTC) mining process. It was established that the minting of new coins would take place through proof-of-work. To carry out this verification and to be able to mine the cryptocurrency, computers would need to solve complex mathematical calculations.In the beginning, there were not many miners. However, that changed before the first Bitcoin bull run. Mining competition skyrocketed, causing a sharp increase in the cost of machines capable of competing. Even more importantly, energy demand exploded with the new machines — which needed energy mainly for processing and cooling.After eight years, the energy demand for mining Bitcoin has grown — and today has reached 116.71 terawatt-hours per year, according to data from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, or CBECI. At first glance, this seems like a lot, right? But let's take a closer look at the data to gain a better understanding of the real impact that Bitcoin mining has on the environment.Related: Ignore the headlines — Bitcoin mining is already greener than you thinkSome influencers have recently appeared on social media and are associating Bitcoin with an alleged increase in the use of fossil fuel energy, especially coal. In fact, some countries — such as China — use coal as an important source of energy. But is that the main fuel for the energy used?According to a study published by the University of Cambridge in September:Also, according to the CBECI, 25,082 TWh of energy is produced in the world yearly. Only 20,863 TWh is consumed, meaning 16.82% is wasted. Bitcoin represents an energy expenditure of 0.47% of the total energy produced and only 0.54% of total electricity consumption worldwide.Another survey recently released by Galaxy Digital compares Bitcoin's use of energy to the use of banks and gold mining. According to the document, the gold industry uses 240.61 TWh per year, while the banking system uses 263.72 TWh.Even more alarming is what the CBECI points out regarding unused electronic devices. In the United States alone, with the electricity spent in one year by connected devices that are not in use, it would be possible to feed the Bitcoin network for almost two years.Therefore, it is clear that Bitcoin's energy consumption is not as relevant as it's said to be, when compared with global energy production and waste. Not to mention that this consumption of roughly 116 TWh is responsible for providing security and access to a dignified life for millions of people around the world.What we really should be aware of when talking about Bitcoin being green is its carbon footprint.Related: Is Bitcoin a waste of energy? Pros and cons of Bitcoin miningUnfortunately, much of the energy currently generated results in a high carbon rate, and that should be the main concern and focal point when discussing Bitcoin's environmental impact.According to data released in 2019 by the scientific journal Joule, Bitcoin's carbon footprint is between 22 and 22.9 metric tons of CO2. It is indeed a relevant amount that is comparable to Jordan or Sri Lanka’s emission rates. However, it is considerably less, for example, than the energy expenditure by the American military force, which according to data compiled by Statista emits 59 Mt CO2.Fortunately, there are simple ways to offset the carbon footprint left by Bitcoin. With the tokenization of assets, some companies have chosen to tokenize carbon credits, making it easier for miners and all those involved in some way with the cryptocurrency industry to lessen the impact caused by the generation of electrical energy used in mining machines.Looking ahead, our attention should be on the reduction of the use of fossil fuels, with the aim to diminish the remaining carbon footprint.It is worth noting that the environmental problem will not be solved only by reducing the use of fossil fuels. It is even more important to optimize the use of the generated energy while focusing on reducing any waste and unnecessary carbon emissions in the process.Related: The pandemic year ends with a tokenized carbon cap-and-trade solutionIt is not expected that energy consumption by mining will increase a lot in the coming years, as it is more associated with computing power than the adoption of Bitcoin itself. Therefore, the 116.71 TWh should remain stable for some time.To achieve the goal of a green Bitcoin network, crypto mining companies can do their part by buying carbon credit tokens and pushing for production with less use of fossil fuels. It is unfair — to say the least — to accuse Bitcoin or miners of degrading the environment while turning a blind eye to the other 99.54% of the energy generated.Bitcoin is open and can go to the ends of the Earth, regardless of limitations or prohibitions imposed by third parties. It is important to remember that this cryptocurrency was created to provide a dignified life to ordinary and underprivileged individuals, to prevent the depreciation of money, to guarantee purchasing power and to improve the quality of life.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

619,"Bitcoin (BTC) is facing difficulty breaching the $40,000 mark again after briefly crossing it on May 26. The cryptocurrency is currently exchanging hands at around the $36,000 mark, which is a 44% drop from its all-time high of $64,889 on April 14. Among others, a key difference between macroeconomic conditions affecting the cryptocurrency market as a whole is institutional demand.One of the key investment vehicles for set demand is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a BTC trust of Grayscale Investments, one of the most significant investment managers for institutions indulging in digital currencies. The trust allows investors to have exposure to the price of Bitcoin through a regulated traditional investment vehicle without having to buy, store and safe-keep their token directly.GBTC trades publicly on the OTCQX, an over-the-counter marketplace that enables stock trading. GBTC currently trades in the $30 range, 46% down from its all-time high of $58.22 on Feb. 19.Each share represents 0.00094716 BTC, with the share tracking Bitcoin’s market price, excluding the applicable fees and expenses. It has a minimum holding period of six months and a minimum investment requirement of $50,000, entailing that it is not ideally suited for retail investors.Due to implications of institutional demand that backs Grayscale and the fact it’s a regulated way of gaining exposure to Bitcoin, its products usually trade at a premium to the net asset value (NAV), or the current value of the holdings. The GBTC premium refers to the difference between the value of the assets held by the trust against the market price of those holdings.Before Feb. 23 of this year, this difference was always a positive number indicating a premium that hit its all-time high of 122.27% four years ago on June 6, 2017. Since the end of February this year, the premium has turned into a discount reaching an all-time low of -17.89% on May 16. Since this difference is driven by supply and demand factors in the market, a rising GBTC premium shows a higher inflow of Bitcoin into the trust, while a decreasing premium transitioning into a discount indicates a declining BTC inflow entailing that GBTC trades at a discount to spot price of Bitcoin.Cointelegraph discussed the implications of the change of the GBTC premium trend with Nikita Ovchinnik, chief business development officer of 1inch Network — a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. Ovchinnik said, “It looks like GBTC premium is a very good indicator of medium-term market sentiment. The premium turned negative at the end of April, and while the digital assets experienced a local boom, lack of institutional interest predicted May’s market cap shrinkage.”This trend is consistent with the number of Bitcoin the Grayscale trust has in its holdings, as it has been increasing gradually since Jan. 13 to reach its all-time high of 655,702.89 tokens on March 2. Since then, its Bitcoin reserves have been on the gradual decline for the first time ever to the current levels of 652,410.55 as of June 4. The trust currently has an AUM of $24.27 billion.The premium allows investors to leverage this opportunity through arbitrage opportunities. One way is for investors to borrow Bitcoin and use it as an exchange for GBTC shares. Once the six-month lock-up period ends, investors can sell the shares in the secondary market at the prevailing premium. With the funds they receive in this exchange, they purchase and give back the borrowed BTC tokens to the lender. In this process, investors pocket the difference in price created due to the premium, thus successfully executing their arbitrage. Ovchinnik further opined:In the traditional financial markets, the GBTC premium/discount can be compared to the pricing of closed-end mutual funds. Ideally, since the amount of Bitcoin by the trust is publicly disclosed, the value of the trust should amount up to exactly that value. Due to the aforementioned premium/discount factors, the value is not the same.Bryan Routledge, associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, told Cointelegraph that the “premium reflected its position as a ‘regulated’ alternative to owning Bitcoin,” thus, “an investor would pay a premium for the access via a trust.” Routledge also added that the GBTC premium shouldn’t be perceived as an additional cost:Despite GBTC trading as a discount in relation to NAV, there have been a few positive signs in the recent trend. The GBTC discount rebounded sharply between May 21 and May 24 from -21.23% to -3.86% before falling to around -12% as of June 3. This indicates that institutional interest is rising in tandem with reducing Bitcoin prices between these days.The direction in which the GBTC premium/discount moves could work as an indicator of market sentiment in the asset, especially among institutional investors.In addition to GBTC, another route for institutional and retail investors alike to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price volatility through a regulated channel is Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.Purpose Investments launched North America’s first-ever Bitcoin ETF on Feb. 18, which saw the assets under management (AUM) rise to over $500 million in under a week and subsequently crossed $1 billion in the same month. The ETF’s AUM currently stands at $714.6 million or 19,407.63 Bitcoin as of June 4 and uses the ticker BTCC.In addition to Purpose’s BTC ETF, Evolve ETFs launched its own Bitcoin ETF on Feb. 19 with the ticker EBIT. Although it lost out on the first-mover advantage that Purpose’s ETF gained, it currently has assets under management of $78.52 million, which is just over 12% of BTCC’s current AUM. Overall, there are several notable ETFs listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.Related: Carbon-neutral Bitcoin funds gain traction as investors seek greener cryptoWhat’s interesting to note about these ETFs is that the timing of their launch coincides with a decrease in the GBTC premium, which eventually turned into a discount. Routledge mentioned why this could be the case, “ETFs are a cheaper (transaction costs, fees) way to Bitcoin exposure. So, the premium on Grayscale has fallen — reflecting good old-fashioned competition.”The GBTC trust has a management fee of 2%, while the Purpose BTC ETF has a management fee of 1%, and the Evolve ETF fee is even less at 0.75%. Due to the success of the existing Canadian ETFs, the lure of the ETF market is such that even Grayscale has confirmed that it will be turning its products into ETFs instead.But before that, they would need the much elusive approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission that several firms have already applied for, including Fidelity and SkyBridge. For Ovchinnik, the existence of these new products is “very important over the long-term horizon, even though we might not see changes instantly.”Related: For the long haul? When Bitcoin nosedived, institutions held fastThe competition for the BTC ETF market share is set to heat up if the U.S. SEC approves any of the several crypto ETF applications it has received. Until that point, GBTC remains among the top indicators of institutional interest, with ETFs following at its heels and fighting for the same market participants.Furthermore, as the GBTC remains closed for new investments until September this year, drastic changes to the current GBTC discount are not expected, but a spell of positive trends as noticed between May 21 and May 24 could bring good news for the lack of institutional demand felt in the market."
620,"On April 14, Bitcoin (BTC) reached a $64,900 all-time high after accumulating 124.5% gains in 2021. However, a 27.5% correction followed over the next eleven days, marking a $47,000 local bottom.The popular Crypto Fear and Greed Index reached its lowest level in 12 months on April 25, signaling that investors were closer to ""extreme fear,"" which was a complete reversal from the ""extreme greed"" level seen during the Bitcoin rally above $60,000.This downward move from April 14 to 25 wiped out $200 billion from the altcoin market capitalization. Still, the recovery that followed could serve as a guide on what to expect when Bitcoin finally manages to exit the sub-$40,000 level.Altcoins posted a similar trend, bottoming at $850 billion on April 22 but fully recovering to a record $1.34 trillion high on May 10. There is no guarantee that this pattern will repeat, but there is no better source of information than the recent market itself.Many investors believe that altcoins consistently outperform when Bitcoin price takes off, but is that an absolute truth?Although that has been the case in 2021, Bitcoin was the clear winner in the last quarter of 2020 as it surpassed the broader market by 110%. However, analyzing the winners from the late-April bull run could provide interesting insights on what to expect for the next rally.Among the top-100 tokens, Ether Classic (ETC), Polygon (MATIC), Waves, and Fantom (FTM) were the clear winners. The winners were either scaling solutions or smart contract platforms, and the sector leader Ether (ETH) also outperformed the market.80% of the worst performers were sub-$1 coins which is precisely the opposite of investors' usual expectations. There's a persistent myth that cheap, nominally-priced altcoins will excel during altcoin rallies, but that clearly was not the case.Unfortunately, there is no way to predict when the current correction will be over, and altcoins historically do not usually excel during bear trends. This means calling 'alt season' at the first sign of Bitcoin's price recovery is an inaccurate strategy that can lead to financial ruin.A general rule of thumb for an 'alt season' kick-off is two or three consecutive days of 30% or higher accumulated gains on cryptocurrencies with little-to-no development, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Ether Classic (ETC).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

621,"Square Inc., a crypto-friendly mobile payments company, is planning to invest $5 million in a solar-powered Bitcoin (BTC) mining facility for Blockstream Mining, offering further insight into Jack Dorsey’s continued support for blockchain infrastructure. Chris Cook, Blockstream’s chief information officer, announced the collaborative partnership on Saturday, where he outlined plans to build the open-sourced mining facility at one of Blockstream’s United States operations.""Together, we plan to provide public transparency by sharing the project economics and knowledge we’ve gained from building a Bitcoin mine powered by renewable energy,” he said, adding:In addition to providing regular reports on the status of the project, the new initiative will also feature a so-called public performance dashboard, where anyone can pull real-time metrics of the mining facility.Bitcoin mining has been the subject of extreme media scrutiny after Tesla CEO Elon Musk decided to stop accepting BTC payments for Tesla cars, citing grave environmental concerns.MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor brokered a truce between Musk and the Bitcoin mining community last month by bringing both sides to the table for high-level talks. The industry-led Bitcoin Mining Council emerged out of the meeting, with miners vowing to accelerate sustainability initiatives.As for Square Inc. the Jack Dorsey-led company has been ramping up efforts to boost adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Cointelegraph reported Friday that Dorsey is strongly considering developing a Bitcoin hardware wallet in an effort to bring self-custody and financial inclusion to the masses.""If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community,” he said in a Twitter post."

623,"Elon Musk is definitely interested in digital currency, but it seems that he doesn’t want to understand it. At least, I worry that he doesn't have a deep enough understanding of Bitcoin (BTC) and decentralized systems in general.A decentralized system has to be secure, and proof-of-work (PoW) is the solution for Bitcoin to secure its digital asset. The more successful Bitcoin is, the more energy is required for PoW to secure the network. In other words, the reason that Bitcoin uses up so much more electricity than Dogecoin (DOGE), for example, is because BTC is much more secure than DOGE.Related: Experts answer: How does Elon Musk affect crypto space?From a power perspective, BTC uses up more energy in Bitcoin mining. This is due to the fact that Bitcoin is in a leadership position. The irony is that electricity is amorphous — amorphous in the sense that you don't know where it comes from. Just by looking at a kilowatt of electricity transmitted to you, unless someone told you, you don't know where it comes from. You have to track the origin source, where sometimes the source is green and renewable — such as solar, wind, hydro or geothermal — but sometimes the energy is dirty coal, nuclear and other dirty energy supplies that are out there.The main issue is that energy itself is neutral. Energy doesn't know where it came from. Energy is just energy — electricity. So, the irony is that with Elon Musk, the electric cars that he sells at Tesla are powered by the same energy that's used in the coal-powered BTC mining machines. It is ironic that he's been criticizing the mining machines for using up a lot of energy, as the Tesla cars are powered using a lot of energy that comes from all over the world. If you get to build and sell 10 million cars, they are going to use a lot of energy as a principle.The way to truly get rid of dirty energy is to shut down production at the source: the power plant. This is the only way to get rid of unsustainable sources of energy. If Bitcoin mining is necessary, you may think that Christmas lights are okay or turning on the air conditioning is okay when in reality, Christmas lights — in my opinion — are truly unnecessary. I can also argue that air conditioning is also unnecessary. On the other hand, washing machines and dryers are necessary, but if you really wanted to, you could try to do the laundry naturally, by hand and in the creek behind your house.These subjective concerns about what's right or wrong, or how one uses their electricity, come down to society. Do we allow society and the mature adults who live in it to choose how they want to use electricity? Should there be some standards, rules or even laws that would regulate it?If you can use washing machines or air conditioners, why can't you use Bitcoin mining machines? All of these appliances are wasting energy, but these examples are designed to make our lives easier and better.Whether it's the Paris Agreement or some other important international decree, the goal must be to eliminate dirty energy at its source, at the power plants, as mentioned previously. To be completely fair, many of the other industries use a lot of electricity: aluminum, steel, gold and silver mining — they all take up a lot of electricity and use a lot of energy, whether it's electricity or fossil fuel energy. In the end, it's a matter of judgment on which activity is good or bad. The answer here would be entirely subjective: For some, it’s good to mine gold or process steel, while mining Bitcoin is environmentally destructive. Conversely, I would argue that mining Bitcoin is good, and processing gold and steel is wasting money, energy and resources. After all, it's subjective.Elon Musk likes being famous, and he likes power — many people probably do. What's interesting is that with Bitcoin, he doesn't have influence on it, due to Bitcoin’s already strong following. In other words, he could not take over Bitcoin and set the direction for it, as it’s already too strong for that.Look at some of the top cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin: My brother, Charlie Lee, is the public face of Litecoin (LTC). Ether (ETH) has a very public founder, Vitalik Buterin. Behind Tether (USDT) is Jean-Louis Van Der Velde. Binance Coin (BNB) has Changpeng Zhao, so on and so forth, and they cannot be taken over because there are notable people in the driver's seats, so to speak. Finally, you have Dogecoin, which was created to be similar to a hobby project, but then the founders of Dogecoin seemed to have disappeared, and DOGE was not actively maintained.Here is an interesting theory: Elon Musk found out about the tragedy of Dogecoin and realized it could be something that he could take control over. He could become the new head of Dogecoin. (That's why I think he didn’t choose any other cryptocurrencies, as they had their own beloved founders and leaders). With such a strong, famous leader of Dogecoin, the price skyrocketed. That's my theory, but in general, I don't like centralized digital currencies. The fact that you can take over Dogecoin and set the direction single-handedly is a bad sign for Dogecoin. To me, that's not very interesting.This article is from an interview held by Max Yakubowski with Bobby Lee.

624,"This is Part Three of a multipart series that aims to answer the following question: What is the “fundamental value” of Bitcoin? Part One is about the value of scarcity, Part Two — the market moves in bubbles, Part Three — the rate of adoption, and Part Four — the hash rate and the estimated price of Bitcoin.If more and more people desire a certain good, and the same amount of units are in circulation, the price will obviously have a tendency to rise. It’s the supply-and-demand rule that governs any market in the world.If one year, a hailstorm destroys the tomato crop and there are fewer edible tomatoes than expected, it makes sense for the price of tomatoes on the market to rise, considering that the demand has remained the same. However, imagine for a moment that suddenly, people want to buy tomatoes much more than in previous years. The demand goes up and the availability of tomatoes goes down, therefore the price will go up a lot more than in the former case.Demand can grow due to two factors: participants are stable and the amount of requests increases or the amount of requests is stable but the number of participants increases. Even a combination of these two is possibleIn the example that follows, we’ve only assumed that the number of participants goes up for the same amount of goods. So, on the one hand, we have Satoshi Nakamoto who defined that Bitcoin (BTC) must become increasingly scarce over time, and on the other, there is a possible boost in the price of Bitcoin coming from new people who progressively enter the market.It is therefore a question of studying the adoption rate of cryptocurrencies in the world’s markets to understand where the value of Bitcoin is headed and, overall, where the cryptocurrency asset class can go in the future.The growth in the number of wallets is not exactly exponential, but close to it. In order to predict its growth in the future, you need to use a “power law” function that is able to best estimate its curvature. To do this, first we put the graph in logarithmic scale, then calculate the function that best approximates it.Though the function does not consider any potential future increases based on a rise in interest that could manifest in 2021 following an unexpected growth in Bitcoin, this exercise is used to estimate the growth over time in the number of wallets.To estimate the growth in the value of Bitcoin using the number of wallets in circulation, we’ll need to estimate the average amount contained in each individual wallet using a fairly simple function:Bitcoin capitalization / Number of walletsNow, we have an estimate of the Bitcoin value each wallet has on average. However, the data tells a completely different story: 70% of wallets have 0.01 BTC or less, while 2% of wallets own over 95% of Bitcoin in circulation, and the exchanges own about 7%.These reports help us understand the enormous growth potential of Bitcoin in the future, as those who own a large part obviously do not sell it since they know Bitcoin and its potential well. Those who have 0.01 BTC or less will be tempted to buy more, and of course, there are always new wallets opening every month.However, by taking the average, we can highlight an average value expressed in U.S. dollars of the content of these wallets:Since the average of these deposits is conditioned by the value of Bitcoin’s price, to best estimate a “range” of prices where Bitcoin could go, the red dotted line represents the tenth percentile of U.S.-dollar deposited wallets; while the dashed blue line represents the 90th percentile. This “range” allows us to frame what the entire capitalization of Bitcoin should be over time, based on the estimated adoption rate of Bitcoin.This estimate doesn’t consider several factors that could make it very prudent. For institutional investors entering the market, the average amount per wallet could go much higher than the blue band identified in the example.Obviously, these estimates should be taken as an intellectual attempt to understand the dynamics of Bitcoin, and absolutely cannot be considered a suggestion or advice on behalf of the authors.This graph shows that a goal of reaching a trillion in capitalization, or $1 trillion, is far from impossible, especially if interest in Bitcoin continues to rise in the coming months.Similar growth is also estimated by the makers of the rainbow chart:This graph is very useful because it summarizes the presumed growth rate of Bitcoin’s value and its bubble trend following each halving.Clearly, there is no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue to move with this logic, but it is important to note that it could do so in order for one to make objective, reasonable investment decisions according to these assumptions as well.This article was co-authored by Ruggero Bertelli and Daniele Bernardi.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

625,"Bitcoin came to life in 2009. More than a decade later, the present day looks back on an enormous amount of development that has built a surrounding industry, complete with other blockchains, assets and solutions. Some folks knew about Bitcoin (BTC) in its early years, while others have jumped on the train in varying droves since then. Looking back through Twitter’s history reveals a few tweets that were far ahead of their time. In 2010, one Twitter user saw Bitcoin’s potential, yet expressed skepticism regarding its future. Little did they know how common the term Bitcoin would become, surfacing as the topic of numerous mainstream news interviews and reporting.Just learned about bitcoin.org. Probably won't leave the realm of geeks, but it has some really neat ideas about electronic currency systemsSomeone else on Twitter thought they were behind the game, back in 2010! The tweet shows a post date of Dec. 1, 2010. Bitcoin’s daily price candle for that day reached a price high of around $0.23 per BTC, according to TradingView’s BraveNewCoin BTC Liquid Index. For reference, Bitcoin reached levels above $60,000 per coin in April 2021. I might be a bit late to the party but bitcoin is definitely the 2nd most interesting thing I have found in a while. http://www.bitcoin.org/Another Twitter user cashed in their Christmas present haul in 2011 for the digital asset.

Since then, some assets, such as Monero (XMR), have come into existence, touting greater privacy. Looking at ways to add more anonymity to bitcoin"
626,"Overconfident Bitcoin (BTC) bulls would need to battle more than just Elon Musk as a price prediction model — created by technical analyst pioneer Richard Wyckoff more than 100 years ago — also goes against their wild upside predictions.Dubbed as Wyckoff Method, the model involves a five-phase approach to determine price trends that majorly involve investors' psychological reaction to an asset's supply and demand.For example, in the case of accumulation, when an asset tends to bottom out following sharp price moves downhill, the five phases in order include Selling Climax (SC), Successful Secondary Test (ST), Last Point of Support (LPS), Sign of Strength (SOS), and ""stepping stones"" — that signifies more demand for the asset.On the other hand, the Distribution case appears like a 180-degree version of the Accumulation case, consisting of five phases that follow a strong price trend upward.The Preliminary Supply (PSY) signals a strong demand shift upward as price trends higher while accompanying increasing volumes. However, the uptrend ultimately exhausts, leading to an even called buying climax (BC). It follows a sell-off caused by a lack of demand near the asset's price stop against abundant supply. Wyckoff called the correction as Automatic Reaction (AR).Together, PSY, BC, and AR make Phase A.Meanwhile, Phase B involves a fake rebound towards BC, called Secondary Test (SET), followed by another drop that shows the asset's Sign of Weakness (SOW). Phase B also typically sees weak rebound attempts from SOW towards Upthrust (UT). Later, the transition to Phase C witnesses a terminal shakeout in distribution, known as Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD).Phase D involves an alarming lapse of demand against supply, also known as the Last Point of Supply (LPSY), leading to an all-and-all price crash in Phase E.Tempting Beef, an independent market analyst, alerted his followers that Bitcoin has entered the Accumulation cycle of the classic Wyckoff model. The pseudonymous entity flashed recent rebounds in the Bitcoin market, apprehensibly pointing at BTC/USD's potential to sustain a bullish trend above $40,000 on weakening supply and rising demand.But Tempting Beef presented a conflicting scenario by reimagining Phase A per Wyckoff Distribution schematics. The analyst marked the Bitcoin rebound from $30,000-low as a sign of PSY, leading up to BC, AR, ST, SOW, and other successive events mentioned across the Distribution phases.Bitcoin again landed itself in Phase C, which alarmed about demand exhaustion in the case of Wyckoff Distribution Events. It would mean that the cryptocurrency's point of least risk is to the downside — a price crash. Bitcoin's latest correction in the spot market surfaced following a yearlong rally. Between March 2020 and April 2021, the BTC/USD exchange rate ballooned by as much as 1,582%, logging an all-time high near $65,000.However, the pair wiped more than 50% of its price rally. The prices crashed, recovered, and they now consolidate sideways without hinting at a specific short-term bias for direction. Therefore, it now appears more like a Wyckoff Distribution model, since the phases follow a yearlong move upward, not downward.Meanwhile, Bitcoin has been consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle structure following its sharp downside correction after mid-May, hinting that the pattern is — in fact — a bearish pennant. Technically, bearish pennants send the prices lower by as much as the scale of the previous move lower.BTC/USD is trading at around $36,000, or 44.59% below its $65,000-top as of this time of writing."

628,"Challenges stimulate progress. Technology, pretty much like life itself, cannot be static. Only dynamics stimulate positive changes. Amid the collapse of the cryptocurrency market in mid-May, many retail and institutional investors began to lose faith in the bright future of cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin (BTC) in particular. Corporations and institutions, whales, and early adopters converged in a single impulse — the internet was overwhelmed by a wave of mistrust towards “cryptocurrency number one” as the best defensive asset, superior to gold and everything else that had been invented prior.One needs to see the full picture here to realize what’s happening. The last time the market suffered more or less comparable and significant losses was a year ago, in March 2020. This year, the panic sell-offs caused by a series of negative events — Elon Musk’s Twitter crusade against BTC, the rumoured court case against Binance and the latest crackdown on crypto from the Chinese government — bring to mind the tremendous collapse of digital assets at the peak of many asset rates in December 2017 and the succeeding “crypto winter”.Related: Experts answer: How does Elon Musk affect crypto space?However, many people who have little understanding of how the cryptocurrency market functions do not realize the depth of changes that the space has been through in recent years. Emotions are the worst enemy of an investor or trader in a rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem. It is worthwhile to look dispassionately at the facts and analyze the changes to understand the true value of ecosystems growing on the fertile soil of the blockchain.The investment mindset has changed in recent years. Even though it continues to be dominated by a highly speculative component, there is also a practical application for the settlement. Investors switched from short-term speculations to the long game. The number of Bitcoin ATMs has doubled since 2020. This dramatic rise clearly demonstrates a growing demand for the world's largest crypto assets. From a niche, the cryptocurrency industry has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry.Stablecoins — tokens pegged to their corresponding fiat asset such as the U.S. dollar, euro, etc. — have gained significant weight in 2020-2021. With the emergence of new platforms known as decentralized finance, or DeFi, protocols, opportunities appeared to offer profit without risks of the principal asset, for example. Such platforms are nothing more than distributed programs that provide clearing, custody and settlement services. Every year they take a larger piece of the pie from traditional financial institutions. The surge in activity in the environment of decentralized trading platforms also occurred because they do not have the same common vulnerabilities as centralized trading platforms in their infrastructure.Decentralized exchanges outperform centralized exchanges in terms of trading volume, demonstrating a thousandfold growth in trading volumes in the last year alone. Interfaces for interacting with DeFi can be created by any programmer anywhere globally, and the essence of this interaction is the development of a financial ecosystem running on the global blockchain. By now, DeFi's market capitalization has reached over $100 billion, and this trend will undoubtedly continue soon.Related: The rise of DEX robots: AMMs push for an industrial revolution in tradingSpeaking of examples, we can outline that even large companies like Deutsche Telekom have abandoned private blockchains and are studying public infrastructure, supporting nodes in networks such as Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, Celo, etc. This fact suggests that the world of decentralized finance is gaining ground in the global market for clearing, custody and settlement services — just as Bitcoin had previously secured the status of a shielding asset, removing gold from its throne.We observe that corporate demand accelerated when real rates on dollar deposits turned negative (central bank rate minus inflation). Inflationary expectations have intensified over the past year, fueling demand for long-term capital preservation. Today, Bitcoin is successfully winning the hearts and minds of not only speculators and hedge funds who, realizing the inevitability of the devaluation of dollar balances, vote with their money and transfer some of the treasury liquidity into digital assets.Related: Forecasting Bitcoin price using quantitative models, Part 2Meanwhile, divergence in the regulatory approach continues. Some jurisdictions have created bills, but they have no practical application. At the same time, other countries are just at the beginning of the road to create regulations, and some banally prohibit the use of cryptocurrencies — the recent example of China being a case in point.In the United States, for example, banks were allowed to provide custody services for cryptocurrency assets. The emerging markets of such countries as China, Russia and India stand apart, rushing from fire to fire, remaining uncertain and trying to propagandize something at the state level, offering potential investors the so-called ""technological candy."" Unfortunately, in practice, all projects that reach the world level often move to other jurisdictions — which is very sad.Related: Stablecoins present new dilemmas for regulators as mass adoption loomsThe future of the cryptocurrency sector is undoubtedly optimistic. Any period of ""cleansing"" and dumping of price ballasts, correction and decline, should be perceived as another round of evolution. In the near future, we should expect that investors will switch their attention from meticulous market monitoring, hype regarding coins (which does not carry any value to the community) and the expectation of new price records to the construction of products in developing areas. The cryptocurrency sphere is expecting the emergence of more convenient, reliable and accessible interfaces for mainstream investors interacting with the digital asset market, as well as 3.0 generation blockchains — for which fierce competition will erupt in the next few years.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

629,"At the bustling Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Congressman Warren Davidson, alongside United States Senator Cynthia Lummis, sat down to field interview questions. The interview took a turn toward privacy, with Davidson responding with comments on crypto wallets. “At the end of the year, if you think about it, Secretary Mnuchin was talking about banning private wallets,” Davidson said, responding to a question about the possibility of over-regulation in crypto. “That’s a horrible approach,” he added. “If we don’t protect private wallets, someone is going to try to ban them.”As Davidson mentioned, December 2020 saw the U.S. Treasury suggest strict overwatch on self-custodied digital asset wallets, with certain specifics, such as calling for more information from users transacting with wallets held away from crypto exchanges.“I wish the country would take the threat to privacy as seriously as they take the threat to the second amendment,” he said. The second amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives citizens gun ownership rights.Taking her turn at a response, Lummis noted the importance of teaching U.S. government folks on Bitcoin. “We’re trying to create a financial innovation caucus so we can use it to educate members of the U.S. Senate and their staffs about Bitcoin, its advantages, and why it is just such a fabulous asset to dovetail with the U.S. dollar,” she said. “It can be the underlying network, worldwide, to keep the dollar the global reserve currency, but still allow people to transact in a very freedom-loving way,” she said, adding:In recent years, Venezuela has seen soaring levels of inflation amid a broad economic decline that was partially tied to the oil-price collapse of 2014.The Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami thus far has hosted significant action in terms of speakers and discussions. The event will continue for a second day on Saturday. "
630,"The first official day of the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Florida yielded no shortage of newsworthy events. Thousands of conference-goers came together to take in speeches, interviews and panels from a wide array of guests, such as Miami mayor Francis Suarez, who spoke about the city’s efforts “to create the Bitcoin, blockchain and mining capital of the world.” Suarez’s track record is filled with various forms of involvement in the crypto and blockchain space, as he noted in his speech. “The days of a currency being tethered to a central bank are coming to an end,” Suarez said after expressing several favorable views about Bitcoin, including: “The U.S. will become a powerhouse for clean energy Bitcoin mining.”Other speakers, panelists and interviewees included Kraken head of growth Dan Held, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor and Draper Fisher Jurvetson founder Tim Draper, among many others. Peter McCormack, the host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, maintained one of the conference stages for some of the day’s action, introducing guests.We just had an amazing panel discussion on Picturing The Hyperbitcoinized World featuring #Bitcoin heavyweights @parkeralewis, @SaifedeanAmmou6, @danheld, and @real_vijay at #Bitcoin2021. Are you ready for a world where BTC is king? pic.twitter.com/OaHUuAg9JuDuring Michael Saylor’s time on stage, he was asked about his experience in the crypto space so far. “I realized that I first bought Bitcoin one year ago yesterday, and so this is the end of my rookie year,” Saylor said.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey also spoke at the conference today on the topic of the bankless population. “Internet needs a native currency,” he said during his interview. “We need to be able to transact with it every single day.”During a later on-stage discussion, Binance US CEO Brian Brooks said: “If you’ve never worked in a big bank, you have no idea how bad the problem is.” Brooks previously served with the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Before joining the regulatory body, he had several career stops, including spending years with OneWest Bank N.A.Take a peek inside the largest Bitcoin conference ever:Be sure to follow Cointelegraph on Twitter to keep up with all the latest happenings at Bitcoin 2021.

631,"Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone believes Bitcoin (BTC) is more likely to turn up and rally to $100,000 rather than correct to $20,000. In the June edition of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index report, McGlone said that Bitcoin’s correction had not dented its foundation and it was ""stronger, greener and less extended"" than in April.While Bitcoin has yet to witness a surge in demand, data from Coinshares show crypto funds have turned the corner and after two weeks of outflows, investors have pumped $74 million into cryptocurrency.Ether (ETH) products were leading the inflows with $47 million being pumped into them. Altcoins such as Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP) and Polkadot (DOT) each experienced more than $3 million in inflows.Novice traders seem to be in a hurry for the next leg of the bull move to begin. However, that is unlikely to happen quickly because after the recent market reset, the transfer of assets from weaker hands to stronger hands will take time. The reactions to Elon Musk’s tweets show some froth still remains.The crypto market may remain volatile as long-term investors are accumulating on lower levels but stopping their purchases at higher levels. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies and determine the critical support and resistance levels to watch out for.Bitcoin rose above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on June 3 but the bulls could not push the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($39,856). This suggests the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on relief rallies.The bears have pulled the price back into the triangle and they will now try to sink the price below the support line of the triangle. If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could retest the critical support zone at $30,000 to $28,000.If this zone cracks, panic selling may set in and that could result in a drop to the next major support at $20,000. Such a deep fall could delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close above the 20-day EMA. That will suggest the sentiment has improved and bulls are buying at higher levels. The rally could then extend to the 50-day simple moving average ($48,192).Ether broke above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on June 3 but the bulls could not push the price above the 50-day SMA ($2,895). This may have attracted selling from short-term traders and the price dipped back into the triangle today.The flat moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest a few days of consolidation. The pair could remain stuck inside the triangle for a few more days.A breakout and close above the 50-day SMA will signal the start of an up-move that could reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,362.72. Conversely, a break below the triangle may result in a retest of the critical support at $1,728.74.Binance Coin’s (BNB) relief rally hit a wall near the overhead resistance at $423.83 on June 3. This suggests the bears are defending this level and the bulls will have to push the price above it to gain the upper hand.If the BNB/USDT pair rebounds off the trendline, it will suggest the formation of an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $433. This bullish setup has a target objective at $586.The flattening 20-day EMA ($400) and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action. This view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the trendline. That could open the doors for a drop to $211.70.Cardano turned down from just under the $1.94 resistance today, suggesting the bears are defending this level aggressively. However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls are buying on dips to the moving averages.The buyers will now make one more attempt to drive the price above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could pick up momentum and challenge the all-time high at $2.47.Alternatively, if bears sink the price below the trendline, the ADA/USDT pair could slide to $1.59 and then to $1. A strong rebound off this support will suggest the pair could trade inside the large range between $1 and $1.94 for a few days.The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint also suggest a few days of consolidation.Dogecoin (DOGE) turned down from $0.44 on June 2, suggesting that traders are closing their positions on rallies. The bears have pulled the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.37) today, indicating weakness.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the DOGE/USDT pair continues its slide and breaks below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern, the selling could intensify. The bulls may try to arrest the decline at $0.21 but if they fail to do so, the pair may drop to $0.10.This negative view will nullify if the price bounces off the neckline and rises above $0.47. Such a move will indicate the bulls are back in the driver’s seat and the pair could then rally to $0.59.XRP’s failure to rally above the 20-day EMA ($1.06) suggests the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. If the bears sink the price below the trendline, the decline could extend to $0.79 and then to $0.65.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 44 suggest the bears have the upper hand. A break below $0.65 could clear the path for a drop to $0.56 and then to $0.45.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the trendline, it will signal strength. If the bulls push and sustain the price above $1.10, the XRP/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($1.27) and then to the downtrend line.Although Polkadot rose above $26.50 on June 3, the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggested selling by traders at higher levels. The altcoin has turned down today and broken below the $26.50 level.The bears will now try to pull the price down to the trendline. If this support holds, the DOT/USDT pair could again rally to $26.50. If the bulls sustain the price above this resistance, the pair may rise to the 50-day SMA ($32.64).Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, the pair could drop to the $15 support. If the price rebounds off this support, the pair could remain range-bound between $15 and $26.50 for a few days.The flat 20-day EMA ($26.45) and the RSI below 46 also point to a few days of consolidation.Uniswap (UNI) has again turned down from the 20-day EMA ($28.14) today, indicating the bears are aggressively defending this resistance. The sellers will now try to pull the price down to the support at $21.50.The bulls are likely to defend $21.50 aggressively as they had done on May 30. A strong rebound off this support will confirm the formation of a higher low. The UNI/USDT pair could then remain range-bound between $21.50 and $30 for a few days.This neutral view will be negated if the bears sink the price below $21.50. That will suggest the sellers have overpowered the buyers, resulting in a drop to $16 and then to $13.04.On the contrary, a break above $30 could push the price to the 50-day SMA ($33.27) and then to the 78.6% retracement level at $38.15.After trading in a tight range between $103.71 and $120 for a few days, Internet Computer (ICP) broke above the overhead resistance on June 3. However, the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows the bears used this rally to sell and trap the aggressive bulls.The ICP/USDT pair turned down sharply today and the bears are now trying to pull the price below the $103.71 support. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the all-time low at $86.01. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the pair could decline to $60.However, if the bulls defend the $103.71 support, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The buyers will have to sustain the price above $120 to signal the possibility of a consolidation between $103.71 and $168.The relief rally in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the downtrend line today, indicating the bears are defending this level aggressively. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($780) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest the bears are in control.If bears sink the price below $616.04, the altcoin could drop to $468.13. This level may act as a strong support. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the price above the downtrend line.If they succeed, the BCH/USDT pair could rally to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $919.60. A break above this resistance could open the doors for a rally to the 50% retracement at $1,059.07.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

632,"When it comes to China, few things are crystal clear, and the nation’s recent crackdown on crypto mining is no exception. The State Council’s Financial Stability and Development Committee reported on May 21 that it is curtailing Bitcoin (BTC) mining amid financial risk concerns, which prompted the South China Morning Post to proclaim that “China’s place at the centre of global bitcoin mining is fading.” “We are seeing the cryptocurrency market enter a path to ‘de-China-isation’ — first on trading and now on computing power, based on a series of stronger steps taken against cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin mining last week by Beijing,” Wang Juan, associate professor on blockchain at Xi’an Jiaotong University and a member of the OECD Blockchain Expert Policy Advisory Board, told the publication.But maybe not. Darin Feinstein, founder and executive chairman at Blockcap — one of the largest crypto miners in North America — isn’t absolutely convinced that Bitcoin mining is finished in China, the world’s current mining center. In 2017, China made a similar announcement, he told Cointelegraph, further explaining:Still, three mining companies — BTC.TOP, Huobi and HashCow — announced they were closing shop on the mainland, while China expert Bill Bishop reported in his newsletter “Sinocism” that the eight government draft measures taken against mining activities in the Inner Mongolia region were “harsh,” and “it is going to be much harder to think that this is just a passing crackdown and that things will return to normal relatively soon.” Other provinces and regions, including Sichuan and Xinjiang, might follow suit.No one can be certain what is going on behind the curtain in China, as Feinstein notes, but it’s worth asking: What is the real impetus behind the latest (apparent) crypto mining clampdown, and why now?Is it purely to ward off financial risks, as the state announced, or might something else might be involved, including energy/environmental concerns? Will China-based mining businesses now move offshore, and if so, where might new crypto mining centers arise?Finally, is this another signal that energy-intensive proof-of-work validation protocols, the sort used by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, are increasingly problematic in an ecologically anxious world?“Control over monetary policy and financial systems is important for a central government, and Bitcoin is a threat to that,” Ethan Vera, chief operating officer of Luxor Tech, told Cointelegraph in reference to the new mining restrictions, adding, “Bitcoin is clearly cementing its place in the world and proving itself as a valuable store of value for people globally. This threatens the old systems.”Yu Xiong, associate dean international at Surrey University and chair of business analytics at Surrey Business School, cites environmental concerns as the number one reason for the crackdown. Countries like China, which have declared they want to become “carbon neutral” at some point in time — 2060 in the case of China — are now feeling increasing pressure “to stay away from emissions-intensive sectors.” Bitcoin mining is one sector that can be easily sacrificed “without too much cost at the national level,” Xiong told Cointelegraph.Why now? “Bitcoin grew too fast recently and has impacted many investors’ behavior,” said Xiong, adding, “Governments normally want to see a sector grow reasonably rather than radically — so some action had to be taken.”It might not necessarily be the end of mining on the mainland, however, in Xiong’s view. The sector could emerge later as a regulated industry. To put things in economic terms, “they already earned money in this round, so now they cash out, wait for the price to go down, then join again,” according to him.“It is too early to tell the actual effects of the vice premier’s comments,” said Vera, adding, “We have seen a couple hundred megawatts of power requests cross our desk this week.” He further explained:Vera suggested that ecological concerns about the energy usage and carbon footprint of crypto mining may be something of a “scapegoat,” while Feinstein opined that the environmental question had some nuances. For instance, in the Sichuan region, “the majority of power is renewable, sourced from a large collection of hydroelectric plants running renewable energy. Those plants have massive excess energy during the Chinese rainy season,” with electricity costs close to zero.Elsewhere, though, China uses vast amounts of coal, Feinstein continued. “I would assume that to meet their internal climate goals, the coal regions will face pressure to close,” while miners located where renewable energy sources are prevalent may face fewer restrictions. “But we have yet to see a comprehensive document come out, so it’s pure conjecture at this point.”Winston Ma, adjunct professor at New York University School of Law and author of The Digital War: How China’s Tech Power Shapes the Future of AI, Blockchain and Cyberspace, told Cointelegraph that environmental concerns were, indeed, a large factor in the clampdown, and while hydropower — as used in the Sichuan region — is considered as clean energy, “the Chinese government has pledged to meet energy efficiency targets, which could still limit the expansion of high energy-consuming industries like crypto mining,” adding:Feinstein, however, disputes the carbon footprint and energy consumption arguments — insisting they lack context. “The total energy produced in the world is 160,000 terawatts per hour of energy. This is all energy from every source. The Bitcoin network uses 120 TWh of that energy. That means, simply, that the Bitcoin network uses .00075 of available energy in the world,” or less than one-tenth of 1%.Similarly, the carbon released “as a result of the energy used in plugging the machines into the grid power” is also less than 0.1%, and that number drops sharply as more mining rigs switch to renewable energy sources. Feinstein added:If China is indeed down-throttling crypto mining, will North America replace it as mining’s regional center — as some were suggesting even before the new restrictions? Who else might profit?According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, Bitcoin currently consumes around 110 terawatts per hour per year, while Ethereum adds another 44.5 — according to Digiconomist — and this doesn’t even include other PoW cryptos, so if a significant portion of that gets shut down in China, it will have to find a new home. Says Vera:“If the Chinese miners are nervous about future policies, they will slow down on new equipment purchases,” said Feinstein, “and those equipment purchasers will go to the next-best customers, which I believe are in the United States. So, we should see United States mining companies increasing hash rate.”But there are potential hindrances here, including the lack of infrastructure companies to supply the electricity needed to power the computers that validate crypto’s block transactions. “In terms of plugging those machines in, you need to have [...] companies building enough infrastructure at a pace to accommodate those miners. Currently, the demand to plug in miners exceeds the available infrastructure,” Feinstein said.Related: North American crypto miners prepare to challenge China’s dominance, Cointelegraph Magazine“Kazakhstan and Canada are regions that Chinese miners are talking about these days for potential relocation,” adds Ma. But relocating may not be as simple as it sounds. “Chinese miners may have to deal with unfamiliar partners, unstable power supplies and unexpected new compliance costs. Adding on the relocation costs, probably only the biggest and most resourceful mining operators can make the exodus smoothly.”It’s important to note that all of the large Bitcoin ASIC manufacturers are located in China, Thomas Heller, co-founder and chief business officer of Bitcoin mining service provider Compass Mining, told Cointelegraph. Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan are the only three companies with new-gen Bitcoin ASICs. Heller stated further:Elsewhere, “Russia and Kazakhstan are preferred for shifting large quantities of old-generation miners due to lower power prices,” added Heller, “while North America is more suitable for new-gen units. The challenge right now in North America is a severe shortage of rack space for hosting miners.”Taking the longer view, what does all this contention say about Bitcoin — and other cryptocurrencies that use energy-gobbling validation protocols? Is this a sustainable sector over the longer term? “While we don’t believe the crackdown in China has to do with the environment, we do think it’s a pressing issue in North America,” answered Vera, adding further:Bitcoin can continue to grow, especially if all its mining pools move to renewable energy, Xiong told Cointelegraph. Indeed, the sector has the opportunity to be a shining example to other industries — i.e., “the first sector that achieves Zero Carbon.”Elsewhere, Xiong wrote that “regulations and rules should be enacted as soon as possible to standardise bitcoin’s coin mining behaviour, and explicitly require that only renewable energy sources such as solar energy and hydrogen energy can be used for cryptocurrency mining.”All in all, have the recent events marked the beginning of the end of Chinese crypto mining dominance — estimated to be as high as 80% of the world’s capacity — though some put it lower?“In the long term, nearly all of Chinese crypto mining rigs will be sold overseas, as Chinese regulators crack down on mining at home,” wrote BTC.TOP founder Jiang Zhuoer in a blog post, as reported by Reuters. “China will lose crypto computing power to foreign markets,” including European and United States mining pools.Related: Carbon-neutral Bitcoin funds gain traction as investors seek greener cryptoReflecting on the similar mining clampdown announcement by China in 2017, Feinstein told Cointelegraph: “I would predict a similar result this time. These miners will be mining in 2024 when we can expect another similar announcement. We will see certain countries banning Bitcoin and mining over and over again forever. If it was possible for a country to completely ban Bitcoin or Bitcoin mining, it would only happen once.”But maybe the paradigm really has shifted. “We still believe that China will play a role in mining in the long term,” stated Vera. “But this event has fundamentally changed the way Chinese miners perceive domestic risk and will encourage international expansion.”"
633,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell by almost 5% on June 4, continuing the decline into the Friday session as investors grappled with Elon Musk's cryptic tweets on the cryptocurrency, raising speculation that the Tesla CEO might dump the firm's remaining 43,2000 BTC stash.#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/lNnEfMdtJfNonetheless, Bitcoin's move downside also coincided with a big spike in the U.S. dollar index (DXY), raising speculation that more than one factor accelerated the cryptocurrency's dramatic plunge during the late Thursday and early Friday session.In retrospect, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, surged 0.18% to reach a three-week high of 90.627 after Musk's tweet. Meanwhile, the same period witnessed Bitcoin prices crashing by 9.31% to hit an intraday low of $35,593.The chart below illustrates Bitcoin's immediate response to Musk's tweet — a big red candle on hourly charts followed by extended declines. However, while not reacting exclusively to Musk's anti-Bitcoin tweet, the dollar also starts rising on sustained upside bids in traditional markets, eventually logging its biggest daily gains since September 2020.Seasonal cryptocurrency traders perceive Bitcoin as an anti-dollar asset, primarily because the benchmark crypto proposes to work as a haven against fiat devaluation. The narrative has picked momentum primarily after March 2020's COVID-19 pandemic-led global market crash.The event prompted the Federal Reserve to unleash unprecedented supportive measures, including near-zero interest rates and unlimited bond-buying programs, to safeguard the U.S. economy from the pandemic's aftermath. Meanwhile, the U.S. government launched three consecutive stimulus programs — $2.8 trillion in March 2020, $900 billion in December 2020, and $1.9 trillion in March 2021 — to help Americans through direct-check payments with more likely on the way. The expansionary policies upped the U.S. public debt burden from $24.97 trillion in April 2020 to $28.174 trillion in April 2021. As a result, the dollar's strength against major currencies has plumbed by more than 12.5% since March 2020. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's performance in the same period sits at the north of 855%.This Graph Shows The Development Of A 1000 USD Investment In #Bitcoin and traditional investments such as #Stocks, #Gold or #Dollar.

Bitcoin Despite Of The High Volatility Heavily Outperformed All Of Them In The Recent 10 Years. pic.twitter.com/TIae6U7PToThe overnight Thursday decline in the Bitcoin market confirmed a brief negative correlation with the U.S. dollar on short timeframes.However, on the weekly chart, the two assets continue to trend inversely to one another, reminding that Musk, with his $1.3 billion BTC exposure in a $690 billion market, remains irrelevant against much more pressing macroeconomic concerns, including inflation.Tesla continues to struggle to generate earnings from its electric vehicles' sales, showing the company's first-quarter filings. Of the $594 million it reported, only less than $100 million came from its actual business — the rest, on the other hand, came through the sale of its profitable BTC holdings (~272 million) and regulatory credits.In short, Musk's Bitcoin game is similar to that of a retail trader.The billionaire entrepreneur has so far treated cryptocurrency as a tool to offset his company's underperformance.That is further evident with his flip-flop moves on accepting BTC as payments, followed by tweets that he might have Tesla dump its entire Bitcoin holdings, further leading to his breakup meme — that incidentally arrives on the same day when global media reported a 50% decline in the sales of Tesla cars in China over quality issues.Tesla's China orders halved in May - The Information https://t.co/byiMlnKqWk pic.twitter.com/uSYoh9n5eiBut Musk's influence on the Bitcoin market is reducing with each of his anti-crypto tweets, proves the scale of the cryptocurrency declines. For example, his mid-May Twitter spat with crypto influencers crashed the BTC/USD exchange rate from as high as $58,000 to as low as $30,000 — a circa 42% decline. But even then, the pair pared almost 30% of those losses later.In comparison, the latest Elon Musk candle ended up wiping only $3,500 off the Bitcoin valuation, logging a circa 9% intraday loss. Attributing this dump to Elon is a denial that the break out had no volume and couldn't break the 39,5k resistance. When he tweeted the price was already dropping after maybe 3 attempts to breakHence, Bitcoin continues to trade upward long-term, driven higher by the same anti-dollar fundamentals that attracted companies like Tesla to it in the first place.

634,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be just 10 years away from seeing mass adoption in an event known as ""hyperbitcoinization.""That's according to participants of the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, who on June 4 delivered surprisingly optimistic verdicts on when hyperbitcoinization will come.Speaking on a panel, The Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Ammous, Unchained Capital head of business development Parker Lewis and Kraken growth lead Dan Held all gave their deadlines for when Bitcoin will effectively take over global finance.""I'd say a decade,"" Lewis began.That would involve the Bitcoin network onboarding billions of new users by 2031, but as the panel noted, the rate of adoption since 2011 has already produced hundreds of millions of Bitcoiners.""I'm going to be a little more conservative than Parker and say maybe 15 years to 16 years — you know, four more halving cycles,"" Ammous continued.His perspective is similar to that of PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price models, who previously estimated that after several halving cycles, it will become impossible to measure Bitcoin's price in dollars. This is because as a currency with no bottom, the potential for Bitcoin to grow in U.S. dollar terms is infinite.""I would say at least a decade for hyperbitcoinization would be the most likely and actually conservative estimate,"" Held concluded.As Cointelegraph reported, the stock-to-flow model predicts an average BTC/USD price of either $100,000 or $288,000 this halving cycle, depending on which type of model is used.So far, PlanB has remained unfazed by the recent rout that took over 50% of Bitcoin's value off its latest all-time highs of $64,500."
635,"Sberbank and VTB, the two biggest banks in Russia, are not willing to move into the cryptocurrency market in the near future as their CEOs believe that crypto is either too risky or fake money.Sberbank CEO Herman Gref said that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are probably the riskiest type of investment alongside the equity market. In a Thursday interview with local TV channel NTV, Gref claimed that a banking deposit is the best investment option as it is associated with the least amount of risk despite low returns:Andrey Kostin, the CEO of VTB — Russia’s second-largest bank — went even further, arguing that crypto is “fake money.” In a Friday interview with Bloomberg, Kostin said:Kostin expressed confidence that central bank digital currencies will displace crypto, stating that private banks were initially “a bit concerned” about giving all the power over money to the Bank of Russia.“The banks were a little bit concerned that the central bank would take their business but I think we’ve found the solution that actually customers will stay with the banks while the cryptocurrency will be controlled and issued by a central bank,” he said.It is perhaps unsurprising that the aforementioned CEOs are unsupportive of private digital currencies, as the Russian government — itself no major proponent of cryptocurrencies — owns major controlling stakes in both Sberbank and VTB.Yesterday, Oliver Hughes — the CEO of private digital bank Tinkoff — announced that the Bank of Russia won’t let it launch crypto services despite the demand from clients.

636,"Bitcoin 2021, the biggest Bitcoin event in history with a sold-out crowd of at least 12,000 attendees in Miami, is kicking off with some of the world’s biggest industry players.The conference will be one of the largest crypto gatherings to emerge following the COVID-19 pandemic, with organizers expecting more than 50,000 attendees. An unofficial part of the conference kicked off Thursday with a “Whale Day” featuring Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz and BitGO CEO Mike Belshe.The event is positioned to be something “more like a music festival,” featuring multiple stages, including the main “Nakamoto Stage” as well as side stages like “Stacking Sats Stage"" and ""End Of Fiat Stage.""The conference is hosted by Bitcoin Magazine, a crypto publication co-founded by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin back in 2012. Initially set to take place in Los Angeles, California, Bitcoin 2021 was relocated to Miami earlier this year as mayor Francis Suarez began campaigning to establish Miami as the “world’s cryptocurrency capital.”“Mayor Francis Suarez is making a play to establish Miami as the Bitcoin capital of the world, so naturally he’s asked us to bring the largest Bitcoin conference in history to his city, as soon as it’s safe for attendees and residents,” the event organizers said in March.Mayor Suarez himself is set to be the opening speaker of the main conference day one, kicking off the event with opening remarks at the main Nakamoto Stage at 9:00 am ET.Cointelegraph will be on the ground covering the latest developments live on Twitter. But if you’d like to experience the atmosphere of the event, do make sure to tune into our YouTube channel.The event will feature some United States government officials including Senator Cynthia Lummis and U.S. pro-crypto Representative Warren Davidson. Sworn into the Senate in January, Lummis showcased her support for Bitcoin (BTC) earlier this year, adopting the laser eyes photo as part of a laser-eye flash mob on Twitter. Davidson and Lummis will talk at a panel “Bringing Bitcoin Innovation Home To America” at 3:35 pm ET.Bitcoin 2021 will also feature major former U.S. government regulators including Chris Giancarlo, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Brian Brooks, a former acting comptroller of the currency of the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the current Binance US CEO. Giancarlo and Brooks are set to discuss financial innovation at 1:45 pm ET.Other notable Nakamoto Stage speakers include BitGold creator Nick Szabo, Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, former presidential candidate and congressmember Ron Paul, and major crypto and blockchain investor Tim Draper.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is set to discuss the crypto industry’s opportunities to bank the unbanked with Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein at 12:25 pm ET.Some of the world's biggest celebrities are not missing on the major Bitcoin 2021 event. Paris Hilton announced her attendance in a Thursday tweet, stating that she loves being a part of this the crypto community. She made a major move into the cryptocurrency industry earlier this year, stating that she was bullish on non-fungible tokens in her April article about NFTs.The #CryptoQueen has arrived in #Miami for @TheBitcoinConf! ✈️ So excited to go to the #BitcoinConference to hear all the leaders in this space speak. I love being a part of this amazing community. And can’t wait to perform tonight at @11Miami! See you there! pic.twitter.com/m24f8WpeIVStay tuned to Cointelegraph for updates and coverage of the most notable crypto players at this year’s Bitcoin 2021 conference. "
637,"Elon Musk’s tendency to sway the crypto space with devil-may-care tweets was on display again on Friday, as numerous coins lost between 10–18% in the wake of Musk’s latest Bitcoin (BTC) meme.The Tesla CEO’s tweet which showed a Bitcoin sign next to a broken heart emoji could have been interpreted as fairly cryptic, but within minutes the crypto market responded by plunging into a sea of red, as close to $100 billion departed the global market cap.Industry executives, while concerned with the influence Musk exerts on the crypto space, are now growing hopeful that Bitcoin can escape his gravitational pull. Friday’s sell-off was actually an example of this, said the chief operating officer of payment network Mercuryo, Greg Waisman, who pointed out that the latest drop wasn’t quite as violent as others had been in the past.“To a large extent, Bitcoin investors are learning to ignore tweets from Elon Musk and this was made evident as the price drop was not as huge as we have seen before. Bitcoin investors strive to maintain a united front by limiting how they panic sell. This is a good start for Bitcoin,” said Waisman.Waisman said traders were slowly accumulating the industry knowledge that will eventually make Musk’s tweets irrelevant, adding that factors like jurisdictional regulations would become a more accurate driver of markets in the future.“We are getting to the point where crypto stakeholders will react only based on relevant fundamentals. The cryptocurrency industry is growing towards maturity, and to a large extent, knowledge accumulation is taking the center stage,” said Waisman.“As market stakeholders get additional knowledge, they will learn to base their decisions on the influences that matter most, like regional regulations,” he added.Nick Spanos, co-founder of ZAP Protocol, agreed that previous tweets from Elon Musk had proven more destructive to Bitcoin than the one posted on Friday. Spanos said this was a sign that traders were beginning to ignore Musk’s influence.“After today’s tweet of Elon Musk which has pushed Bitcoin price down by roughly 5%, there is some sort of resistance from the coin. But despite its drop Bitcoin is comfortably trading above the critical price level of $36,000,” said Spanos.“From previous trends, the cryptocurrency usually sees steeper plunges but the current 6.83% is a sign that the market is proving to be unmindful of the billionaire’s influence,” he added.Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at CEX.IO, shared similar sentiments, noting that the entire crypto market couldn’t bow to mere individuals like Musk for much longer and that global regulatory matters would soon take center stage.“I feel at some point the crypto market will grow independent of influence from influential people like Elon irrespective of their large follower base on Twitter and only bow to influence from regulators and happenings in the global and international market,” said Anissimov."
638,"Bitcoin (BTC) losing over 50% in a month may have a big silver lining as lower prices set up a classic bull flag.On Thursday, Philip Swift, creator of the Pi Cycle Top indicator, said that this year could still see a major Bitcoin price high.Pi Cycle Top uses two moving averages — the 111-day and the 350-day multiplied by 2 — to determine likely market tops with an error range of just three days.It has proven extremely accurate, and current conditions are setting up a crossover from the two averages which suggests a return to bullishness.“The 111dma (orange line) continues to rapidly drop below the 350dma x 2 (green line),” Swift commented on Twitter.This provides a firm counterpoint to short-term price action amid fears that a so-called “death cross” of two other moving averages may cause pain in the coming weeks.Last week, analyst Filbfilb, who together with Swift heads trading suite DecenTrader, laid out the potential for significant moves up or down for BTC/USD.“Price action is some way from the 20 Week Moving Average (WMA) which is typically the line between Bitcoin being either in a bull or bear market and as such remains a bearish scenario for Bitcoin,” he wrote.As Cointelegraph reported, however, a consensus is building that a local bottom has formed at $36,000 for BTC/USD. This was predicted even before the latest drama involving Elon Musk."
639,"Its infamous circular directing banks to cease servicing crypto firms may have been overturned in the courts but India's central bank is showing no signs of softening its stance towards cryptocurrencies.Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das reiterated the institution's position in a recent press conference following a statement on monetary policy, stressing:The governor's comments come after the Reserve Bank of India had been prompted to clarify that banks should not continue to cite the Reserve Bank of India's now-defunct circular as grounds for refusing services to crypto firms. Recent media reports had suggested the document was still providing an alibi for banks reluctant to deal with entities from the crypto space, despite the fact that the Supreme Court had ruled the ban disproportionate and struck it down in March 2020.Das told reporters that the central bank wants to ""set the record straight"" and  “that particular circular of RBI has been set aside. Therefore it is not correct to refer to that circular.” Despite its repeal, banks have continued to be reluctant to open up to the industry amid a general atmosphere of uncertainty regarding the future of crypto in India. This year, an anonymous source claiming to be a senior official in India's Finance Ministry suggested a long-discussed blanket ban on cryptocurrencies may yet be implemented in the country.While keen to clarify the status of the circular, Das emphasized that banks should continue to follow due diligence measures when it comes to dealing with cryptocurrency-related clients. The central bank has repeatedly pointed to the risks of money laundering and terrorism financing that it fears cryptocurrency usage can facilitate. In parallel, it has been exploring the possible need for a central bank-issued digital currency."
640,"Some of Dogecoin’s (DOGE) observable metrics depict a blockchain in violent flux amid the fallout from the meme coin’s Coinbase Pro listing. The dollar amount sent across the blockchain in a single day exceeded $47 billion on Thursday — a 690% increase on the figure from less than a week before.Dogecoin’s price climbed 40% in a single day shortly after Coinbase announced it would open its doors to Doge deposits on Coinbase Pro on Tuesday, June 1, with a view to commencing trading on June 3.Trading across five trading pairs went ahead on Thursday, and by Friday morning DOGE/USD had become the fourth most traded pair on the exchange, behind Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) and Polygon (MATIC).Coinbase processed $185 million worth of Doge trades in the past 24 hours, according to publicly available market data. Meanwhile, Dogecoin shed much of its Coinbase gains immediately after trading began, as the coin price slid 18% from $0.43 to $0.36.As the coin price oscillates, so too does the blockchain’s usage stats. Massive fluctuations in activity are common to blockchains, and so their meanings aren’t always easy to decipher. The dollar value of coins sent across the blockchain climbed 690% in the space of five days, jumping from $6 billion to $47.5 billion, according to data from Bitinfocharts.com.At the same time, the average transaction value on Dogecoin increased 449%, climbing from $313,000, to just over $1.7 million, all while the number of transactions being processed remained relatively steady.Similar spikes in activity were noted in the days leading up to 4/20 day, when Reddit traders coordinated Dogecoin’s surge to a valuation of $0.420, and also during the market peak of early May.Times of volatility often prompt huge movements of coins from wallet to wallet, or from wallets to exchanges, and the most recent Dogecoin distribution data suggests very few wallets are actually doing the moving.The 100 largest Dogecoin wallets currently account for 67% of the coin supply. That figure is a 38% increase on the figure from 2018 when just under half of the supply was held in the top hundred wallets. At present, just 565 addresses contain almost 80% of the Doge supply."
641,"GCash, a major digital wallet in the Philippines, is reportedly considering introducing crypto trading services.GCash CEO and president Martha Sazon announced that the firm is looking at offering users the ability to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) on its platform.In a Monday interview with The Philippine Star, Sazon said that GCash is exploring cryptocurrency trading in order to keep up with financial innovation. “While we may be considered a disruptor now, it is important in this digital age that we should be mindful of all types of disruptions out there. It’s important to know what the trends are, whether locally and globally and crypto is part of that,” she said.Sazon said that firm is looking at potential integration options and related partnerships, through which it could introduce crypto trading. “Just like in any introductions, you need a platform, a working business model, a partner, so as soon as those are satisfied, perhaps,” Sazon said.GCash is one of the most popular electronic wallet platforms in the Philippines, with at least 40% of Filipinos having a GCash account, according to Sazon. The platform is operated by financial services company Mynt, a subsidiary of Globe Telecom, which operates the largest mobile network in the Philippines.The firm’s potential move into the cryptocurrency industry follows significant growth on the platform, with GCash’s user base spiking over 20% from 33 million to 40 million customers in February. “We will continue to innovate and provide relevant and accessible financial services for all,” Sazon noted.Should GCash adopt crypto services on its platform, the firm would follow similar moves by some of the world’s largest digital wallet and payment service providers like PayPal, Square, Venmo and Revolut. PayPal rolled out its first crypto services last year when it started allowing United States residents to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies."
642,"Bitcoin (BTC) bounced off a predicted floor on Friday as the dust settled on the latest market collision with Elon Musk.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as the pair recovered to levels nearer $37,000 on Friday.Previous strength this week, which had seen a push toward $40,000, abruptly ended in defeat after Musk released another cryptic tweet. In it, the Tesla CEO appeared to suggest that he had moved on from Bitcoin to some form of alternative.The market sold off, but the biggest casualties this time were altcoin traders. Bitcoin only fell by $2,000 — significantly less than during other episodes involving Musk’s tweets.For popular trader Crypto Ed, who predicted that Bitcoin would need to hit $36,000 again anyway before continuing higher, the bottom was now in.“Just need to reclaim some levels and we’re good to go again,” he said, commenting on the market on Friday.Most reactions among Bitcoiners, however, were tongue-in-cheek — part of a wider narrative that reminds spectators that Musk is of no importance to Bitcoin’s strength.Who forgot to invite Elon to the #Bitcoin  conference?Elon's #Bitcoin tweets are a result of being single-handedly destroyed by Ford, the company that made the Taurus and Pinto, with their F-150 Lightning. Sorry you got destroyed Elon but don't take it out on Bitcoin.Short-term barriers to a recovery nonetheless remained. Of particular interest to traders were funding rates on the day, flipping positive after previously favoring longs.In an ironic twist, Musk’s favorite token, Dogecoin (DOGE), lost more than most in the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, trading down 14% at the time of writing.As ever, seasoned market participants called for a longer-term perspective on Bitcoin.Veteran trader Peter Brandt, who said that $21,000 would be the ultimate floor for BTC/USD under current circumstances, was firmly in favor of a bullish continuation.“Why would someone bail out of non-leveraged longs when the market already had 80% of worst-case drop?” he argued earlier in the week.Another publicly bullish opinion came from Bloomberg Intelligence, which in its latest monthly report described cryptocurrencies en masse as “discounted and refreshed.”“Bitcoin is more likely to resume appreciating toward $100,000 resistance rather than sustaining below $20,000,” it summarized.Fundamentals remained stable for Bitcoin, with hash rate — and therefore miners — unresponsive to Musk."
643,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has brought more stress to the cryptocurrency markets by posting another series of cryptocurrency-related tweets on Thursday.Bitcoin lost around $2,000 in a matter of hours after Musk took to Twitter to post about Bitcoin (BTC) again.The Bitcoin price reacted immediately, dropping from around $38,700 to $37,500 in an hour. Bitcoin continued falling as Musk kept tweeting more cryptic posts in the thread including another breakup-themed tweet on falling crypto prices as well as a post on Dogecoin (DOGE).pic.twitter.com/MLhu6oOwgcBitcoin subsequently dipped to as low as $36,400, dropping over 6% over the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $36,322, according to data from CoinMarketCap.The price action comes shortly after Bitcoin attempted to retest $40,000 yesterday, with some traders suggesting that BTC could face a correction before continuing an upward trend.Musk’s new Bitcoin tweets spurred another wave of outrage in the crypto community. Some questioned the credibility of Musk’s tweets regarding Bitcoin.For anyone thinking @elonmusk 's tweets have any credibility and you sold your #Bitcoin

He just tweeted ""CUM"" ‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/Z4x4yUeBw7Musk has been widely criticized in the community since he announced the suspension of Tesla's BTC payment option amid environmental concerns about Bitcoin mining, causing BTC to drop nearly $30,000 in mid-May.Musk has emerged as a major Bitcoin price influencer on Twitter, previously causing major optimism on the market by announcing a $1.5 billion worth Bitcoin purchase in February. Following BTC payment suspension at Tesla, Musk hinted that the company could dump its Bitcoin holdings from its balance sheet.Musk’s latest tweets come right before the Miami Bitcoin 2021 event that is set to kick off this morning, touted as the “largest Bitcoin event in history.”"
644,"The Miami Bitcoin 2021 conference officially kicks off on June 4 and with it has resurfaced controversy over crypto tribalism involving some of the industry’s leading figures.Organizers expect attendance exceeding 50,000 for the Mana Wynwood Convention Center hosted conference. Among the attendees in Miami this year is the founder of Quantum Economics and a former Senior Market Analyst at eToro Mati Greenspan.Writing today, Greenspan highlighted a growing rift in the crypto community in what he described as a ‘toxic problem’. The financial advisor had inadvertently ignited a social media storm with the innocuous comment that Bitcoin 2021 would be “Biggest crypto conference ever!”Greenspan was told in no uncertain terms that it was a “Bitcoin conference” intended only for BTC enthusiasts. Bitcoin Magazine editor Pete Rizzo set him straight:Greenspan replied that “Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency sir”, however, it only served to fuel the tirade from Bitcoin maximalists claiming exclusivity on the event.This really is a shitshow. pic.twitter.com/vrAVxiko0pThe Miami Bitcoin 2021 conference will run until June 5 and play host to a vast pool of industry luminaries ranging from former congressman Ron Paul, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, the Winklevoss twins, and Morgan Creek Digital partner Anthony Pompliano. To be fair to the organizers they have been crystal clear that it's a Bitcoin Only Event/No Altcoins Allowed in the Telegram channel:A clearly disappointed Greenspan retorted that there was clearly a lot of insecurity among the Bitcoin crowd, and eventually tired of the debate exclaiming: “This really is a shitshow.”Bitcoin maxis sounding so insecure in this thread. Name calling and even threats, just for using inclusive verbage. WTF?!

You don't own Bitcoin and crypto isn't after your lunch. So chill the F out. https://t.co/I31S4vWoCEIn his newsletter today he clarified his thoughts on the topic:Greenspan said that “zealotry” was unproductive and urged the community to “focus our energy toward a common enemy and not spend our time and efforts on infighting. It doesn't help.”The Bitcoin-only vibe extended beyond Greenspan with some questioning why Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had made an appearance after various photos of him surfaced including one with Miami’s pro-crypto Mayor Francis Suarez. Buterin actually unveiled Ethereum at the Bitcoin Miami 2014 event.DeFiPulse co-founder Scott Lewis saw the funny side of things:lolol bitcoin maxis are gonna try to go 2 days without talking about ethereum.

645,"Major crypto solutions provider Blockchain.com is moving its United States headquarters from New York to Miami in an attempt to spur aggressive growth over the next few years.The $5 billion firm intends to hire 300 new full-time employees in the region over the next 18 months. The news broke a day before the city played host to the world’s largest Bitcoin conference, Bitcoin 2021.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez made the announcement at City Hall with Blockchain.com CEO Peter Smith. He explained that not only will the move boost local employment but it will also be an investment in the local science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) community via educational programming. Suaraz said:Blockchain.com cited a key driver of the move was “the city’s welcoming regulatory environment serving as a hotbed of crypto innovation.” The firm's global headquarters will still be based in Londonn, however, Miami will stand as its U.S. HQ.  Blockchain.com also has offices in San Francisco which will remain.Blockchain.com, with a $5 billion post-money valuation, is arguably the biggest blockchain-related company poached by Miami since Mayor Suarez began his intense crypto push. The company services 32 million users across 200 countries.Over the last year, Suarez has made it clear that he wants to landmark Miami as the country’s crypto center. Crypto finance firm XBTO Group purchased a new Miami office in April, Scott Minerd from global investment firm Guggenheim Partners and Peter Thiel associate Keith Rabois have also bought property there. Crypto exchange FTX secured a 19-year deal for naming rights to the Miami Heat arena, and Borderless Capital announced a $25 million fund for Miami-based crypto businesses on June 2.Suarez has also held meetings with the Winklevoss twins, Elon Musk, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google CEO Eric Schmidt in an effort to convince them of Miami’s benefits.Suarez has demonstrated a personal conviction as well, publicly revealing that he owns Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), and is planning on “buying the dip”."
646,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape, and enterprise blockchain integrations.Last week’s column had a look at the recent crackdown on cryptocurrency miners as China heads towards a more carbon-neutral policy. This week, the Southwest province of China was humming a slightly different tune as the Sichuan Energy Regulatory Office organized a symposium on the topic. The province has a heavy mining concentration due to low cost energy generated from a developed hydroelectric power system. The symposium failed to reach a resolution, leading to speculation that the green energy of the province will lead to much more positive regulation.Zhang Nangeng, CEO of mining-machine manufacturer Canaan, added to this speculation by calling for China to make allowances for green-energy powered miners. “For-profit miners prefer regions with low electricity prices that indicate oversupply, and likely energy waste. Bitcoin miners also help create jobs in impoverished regions and contribute to fiscal coffers,” pointed out the CEO. It seems unlikely that China will continue to allow miners to abuse coal-powered electricity in regions like Inner Mongolia, but for Sichuan there is definitely an argument to be made in favor of the lucrative mining industry.On June 2, national television channel CCTV-13 reported on virtual currency fraud in their News Room segment. In the report, they introduced how a virtual currency TRTC was listed on Uniswap before having all the liquidity removed. Blockchain smart contract auditor SlowMist was also featured as they demonstrated how the fraudulent activity was conducted. In the TRTC case, 59 ETH were removed from the pools, worth about $100,000. CCTV-13 concluded by warning about the risks of financial fraud on cryptocurrency platforms such as Uniswap. On Twitter, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams mistakenly tweeted about the segment, confusing the video clip as a positive report. Apparently Adams hasn’t spent as much time practicing his mandarin as other early Ethereum pioneers Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood, who both have a decent grasp of the language.In a Chinese-language interview on May 29, Binance founder CZ distanced himself further from Binance Smart Chain by claiming that it has no control over the chain and that it was not responsible for the creation of it. He coyly suggested that BSC has been a community project and that he rarely speaks to the team behind it. Binance and competing Chinese exchanges may be rethinking their positioning after a series of hacks and exploits have haunted the various ‘smart chains’ that offer further utility to exchange tokens and their users.Despite the increasingly harsh regulatory environment, China hasn’t backed down on its pro-technology stance. On May 31, new blockchain technician standards were released from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The standards detailed what skills and core competencies are required to work in the industry.Beijing is launching another digital yuan lottery as it continues to push the release of the central bank digital currency. The Beijing Local Financial Supervision and Administration announced on June 2 that the government will distribute the free currency to citizens who apply before June 7. This comes in the same week that former People’s Bank of China director Yao Qian stated that the digital yuan was not to be used as a surveillance tool. He claimed the technology was initially developed to counter the private sector’s control of the payment sector. The western world might remain skeptical on this point but the need to balance the private sector is certainly plausible, given the national dominance of Alipay and WeChat pay."
647,"Ether (ETH) has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) by 32% since May, and even though there has been a steady flow of bullish reports from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, derivatives metrics show elements of bearishness in both assets. Bitcoin is trading 41% below its $64,900 all-time high, and that move has driven the ""Crypto Fear and Greed Index"" to its lowest level since March 2020. While retail traders fear the dip, global investment firm Guggenheim Investments has filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for a new fund that may seek exposure to Bitcoin.Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin when he said:Ethereum overtook Bitcoin in terms of miner revenue and network value transacted right as a report from Goldman Sachs revealed that the global investment bank believes Ether has a ""high chance of overtaking Bitcoin as a dominant store of value."" The report noted the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and the nonfungible token (NFT) ecosystems being built on Ethereum.Notice how Ethereum miners' revenue significantly outpaced revenue for Bitcoin miners in May, reaching a $76 million daily average. This figure leapfrogged Bitcoin's $45 million in miners' revenue, including the 6.25 BTC subsidy per block, plus transaction fees.A similar situation happened with the amount transacted and transferred on each network. For the first time, Ethereum presented a significant advantage, according to this metric.The chart above shows the Ethereum network settling $25 billion per day on average, which is 85% higher than Bitcoin. Stablecoins certainly played an important role, but so did the $50 billion net value locked in decentralized finance applications.When measuring the futures contract premium, both Bitcoin and Ether display similar levels of bearishness. The basis rate measures the difference between longer-term futures contracts and the current spot market levels.The one-month futures contract usually trades with 10%–20% premium versus regular spot exchanges to justify locking the funds instead of immediately cashing out.As depicted above, the futures premium has been below 10% since the May 19 crash for both Bitcoin and Ether. This indicates a slight bearishness, although far from a negative indicator, known as backwardation.To assess Ether traders' optimism, one should look at the 25% delta skew. The metric will turn positive when the neutral-to-bearish put options premium is higher than similar-risk call options. This situation is usually considered a ""fear"" scenario. On the other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of upside protection and points toward bullishness.Similar to the futures premium, Ether options' 25% delta skew has been ranging above 10% since May 19. This indicates that market makers and whales are unwilling to offer downside protection, indicating ""fear.""Albeit distant from a highly adverse situation, both Ether derivatives indicators point to a complete lack of bullishness, despite the altcoin's 270% gain year-to-date.In the face of this disappointing data, some analysts will find the ""glass half full,"" as it leaves room for a positive surprise. Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, or EIP-1559, which is expected for July, will create a base network fee that would fluctuate based on network demand. The update also proposes to burn transaction fees, thereby introducing deflation to the Ethereum ecosystem. OKEx analyst Rick Delaney stated that it ""may enhance the asset's appeal among the planet's wealthiest investors.""The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

648,"A trade is profitable only if both the purchase and the sale are done at the right time. Many times, traders sell their positions too early and leave profits on the table or they keep holding on to the trade even after the trend changes. This leads to profits evaporating, and many times the trade turns into a loss.While it is important to trade with the trend, it is also important to keep an eye out for signs of a reversal. If traders learn to spot these warning signs, they can avoid buying at the tops and selling at the bottoms, which is a common experience for many new traders.One tool that can help traders spot trend reversals is the relative strength index (RSI) indicator.The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes and as it moves between 0 and 100. Generally, it is used to spot the overbought and oversold levels on any asset.An asset is deemed to be overbought when it exceeds its intrinsic value, either in the short term or long term, and this is an early sign that it could be vulnerable to a correction.Similarly, oversold readings suggest that the selling has been overdone and the asset is trading at a price below its intrinsic value. These assets are considered ready for a rebound.The RSI is assumed to favor the bulls if it trades between 50 and 100. On the other hand, if the RSI is between 0 and 50, it signals that the bears have an advantage. A reading of 50 on the RSI is considered neutral, indicating a balance between the bulls and the bears.The default setting on most charting software designates a reading above 70 as overbought and below 30 as oversold. However, if traders use only these values as their guide for buying or selling, they are likely to buy too early during a bear phase and sell in the initial stages of the bull phase.Therefore, it is important to understand how to use these overbought and oversold readings to maximize profits.Let’s see some examples to better grasp the basics.As shown in the chart above, Binance Coin (BNB) broke above its previous all-time high and started the next leg of its uptrend in February of this year. The coin was at $52 when the RSI rose above 70, indicating it was overbought. Had the traders sold at this point, they would have missed a large part of the future gains.Remember, when a coin starts a new uptrend by breaking out of a range or critical resistance levels, the possibility of the RSI remaining in the overbought territory is high. This is because professional traders identify the start of a new uptrend and start buying without waiting for a dip to purchase. Due to the sustained buying, the RSI remains overbought for a considerable duration.Therefore, in this instance, the position should not be closed just because it has risen above 70.If the RSI rises above 85 during this early period, it is time to be cautious. The BNB/USDT pair shows that the RSI rose above 95 on Feb. 19 when the price hit a local high at $348.70.From there, the altcoin corrected 46% to $186.10 on Feb. 23. During these phases of frenzied buying, it is difficult to predict a top, hence traders should tighten their stops to protect their profits when the RSI starts to trade above 85.On April 12, the RSI again rose above 85 and made a local top. This suggests, traders should be watchful when the RSI reaches 85 even during strong bull phases.Another point to note is that from February to mid-May, the RSI never dipped into the oversold territory. During bull phases, the RSI generally takes support between 40 and 50. When the price dips between these levels, traders should become cautious and look for other supporting signals to initiate long positions.As shown above, Bitcoin (BTC) started its uptrend in October 2020. Notice how the RSI jumped and remained above 70 in the first few days of the start of the bull run. However, the RSI did not reach the extremely overbought zone above 85 during this period.The RSI rose above 85 in January and traders who sold during this period caught a local top. As the price corrected, the RSI dropped from the overbought territory to close to 40 level, which offered a buying opportunity to traders.Ether (ETH) also started its bull run in November 2020 but the RSI did not sustain in the overbought territory. The RSI jumped above the 85 level only in early January and traders who sold at this stage would have been early in booking profits. This shows there is no indicator or strategy that will work every time.However, traders got two more buying opportunities when the RSI reached the 40 level. This would have given them an opportunity to re-enter the market and capture a large part of the remaining bull run.The RSI rose to 83.46 on May 11, just shy of the 85 mark and the biggest altcoin topped out on May 12. This shows that the 85 level is no magical figure and traders should become cautious when the price nears it.The RSI is a momentum oscillator, thus, when price rises, so should the RSI. However, at times the RSI diverges from the price action. In situations like these, even when the price moves up, the RSI fails to do so.This phenomenon is called negative or bearish divergence. This is a warning sign that the bullish momentum may be weakening.The above chart is a good example of a negative divergence, which resulted in a massive fall. The RSI made a high above 89 as Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high at $41,950 on Jan. 8. However, as Bitcoin continued to make higher highs, the RSI continued to make lower highs. This was a sign that the bullish momentum was waning.When a negative divergence forms, traders should become cautious and wait for the price to react downward before selling. In this case, the breakdown below the 50-day simple moving average or the break below the 45 level on the RSI was a sign that the trend may have run its course.The RSI rose above 95 on Feb.19 when BNB reached a new all-time high at $348.70. From there, the price continued its up-move but the RSI made lower tops, forming a negative divergence.This provided ample warning to traders that the bullish momentum was weakening and the altcoin was ready for a trend change. Traders could have sold their positions when the RSI dipped below the 45 level or when the price broke below the 20-day exponential moving average and then failed to rise above it on May 15.Polkadot (DOT) is another good example where the negative divergence resulted in a sharp fall. However, in this case, the RSI did not give a sell signal. Therefore, it is important to not rely on one indicator alone. A break below the moving averages was a signal that the trend was changing and traders could have sold there as the RSI was already signaling weakness in momentum.The RSI is an important indicator that can help signal the end of a bull phase. Extreme readings in the overbought territory and negative divergences both can be used to book profits on positions before the trend shifts.Rather than trying to time the top, traders should consider selling when the RSI and moving averages signal that the trend is losing momentum.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

649,"Despite a massive drawdown in May, the Bitcoin (BTC) bull market appears to be intact, with a $100,000 price target more likely than a retrace to $20,000, according to Mike McGlone, Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist. The June edition of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index report described Bitcoin as ""stronger, greener and less extended"" than during the height of the rally in April. For that reason, the flagship digital currency is more likely to reach the coveted six-figure mark this year than incur a deeper correction back down to 2017 highs.McGlone cited an overextended rally, Chinese restrictions and unwarranted focus on Bitcoin’s energy use as the primary catalysts for the May correction, which included a more than 50% drawdown peak-to-trough.“Bitcoin’s 2021 Foundation Is Firm,” McGlone wrote, adding:He continued:Still, analysts are divided about BTC’s trajectory in the short to intermediate timeframes. Several theorists are forecasting a retest of its 2017 high, with at least one classic indicator predicting a bottom of around $16,000. Others, such as on-chain analyst Willy Woo, have said the bottom is likely in thanks to improving network fundamentals and higher adoption rates.Veteran trader Peter Brandt has speculated that the worst of the BTC price correction may not be over, but he told his Twitter followers that it’s not wise to bail if they’re holding spot positions:Big picture perspective on owning $BTC in appropriate size with money you can afford to lose

Market topped $64,7kf
Market corrected to $30,0k
Worst I can envision is $21,0k

Why would someone bail out of non-leveraged longs when the market already had 80% of worst case drop?Cycle theorist Bob Loukas believes there’s a good chance that BTC's price bottomed last month, but he did warn of an intermediate downtrend over the next 60 days. “Intermediate trend is now down,” Loukas tweeted on May 27. “But secular bull trend providing counter balance.”Nevertheless, he acknowledged the potential for downside risk exposing the $20,000 handle, noting the difficulty of trading without a clear trend in place.Still looking at chopping 60day cycle #bitcoin. Difficult to trade for most. Everyone with off the map price predictions confirms. Mostly observing personally for now (trades).

There is downside risk to $20k (trend is down) so a have plan just in case.https://t.co/13vdALGfSX"
650,"From Thursday through Saturday, a throng of crypto faithful will gather at the Mana Wynwood Convention Center in Miami for the Bitcoin 2021 conference. Bitcoin 2021 perhaps holds even greater significance than usual, as participants can gather in a physical location after COVID-19 restrictions forced many other crypto conferences to go virtual.This year’s conference boasts a stellar cast of members of Congress, celebrities, cryptographers, CEOs and other crypto proponents, with the total attendance anticipated to exceed 50,000 people.Some of the personalities expected at the event include Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, Bitcoin (BTC) permabull and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and the Winklevoss twins — Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — among others.Mayor Suarez recently revealed that he bought Bitcoin after the United States Senate passed its $1.9 trillion stimulus bill back in March.Bitcoin 2021 will also see pro-crypto government officials like Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis as well as former heads of U.S. financial watchdogs like Chris Giancarlo and Brian Brooks. Giancarlo is a former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, while Brooks recently served as the acting comptroller of the currency.Saylor, the Winklevoss twins and Anthony Pompliano will headline the two fireside chats on Friday, while Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla, Square Crypto’s Steve Lee and freelance journalist Aaron van Wirdum will appear in fireside chats on Saturday.On topics related to scalability, Zap CEO Jack Mallers will talk about businesses utilizing the Lightning Network, while the MIT Bitcoin Project’s Jeremy Rubin will appear in a panel titled “Bitcoin is DeFi.”With the recent criticisms of Bitcoin mining, it is perhaps unsurprising to see a few panels dedicated to the subject, with titles like “The Moral Case for Bitcoin” and “Bitcoin Mining Fixes Our Energy Problems.”Other panels planned for the event will explore topics concerning on-chain analytics, proof of reserves and banking the unbanked.Cointelegraph's editorial team will be on sight to provide the latest updates on the biggest events as well as to conduct interviews and even livestreams through YouTube and Twitter. Stay tuned!"
651,"Bitcoin (BTC) is slowly but surely preparing to flash the ""buy"" signal, a key indicator suggests as a trading frenzy reignites memories of the GameStop debacle.In its latest report from June 3, Stack Funds highlighted the Puell multiple nearing the green ""buy"" zone — a signal to enter the market.The Puell multiple is one of the best-known BTC price tools. Its readings judge the likelihood of a sell-off or uptick based on miner profitability. Currently, it makes little sense for miners to sell unless out of sheer necessity.""The metric is now trading at the 1.40 level, closer towards the green zone, where miners have a lesser incentive to sell. This signifies potential buying opportunities should the multiple declines to below 1.0,"" Stack Funds head of research Lennard Neo explained.As Cointelegraph reported, Stack Funds is not alone in arguing that the chances of a further price dip are worth considering. Traders are also eyeing a retracement, with at least one saying that it is all but certain that further upside will only come after a return to $36,000 for BTC/USD.Neo further pointed to several other, albeit unnamed, metrics pointing to a bullish continuation this week that cover the short- to mid-term range.Meanwhile, a return to volatility — now firmly in the cards this week — could come from retail traders.In a scene reminiscent of the GameStop stock trading escapades from quarter one this year, Reddit users have turned their attention to another underperforming company's equity and inflated its price accordingly.AMC Entertainment, a loss-making United States movie theater chain, has seen huge gains — at one point over 1,000% year to date — and filed to sell 11 million shares. Should history repeat itself, some argue that investors could reembrace altcoins next — in particular, memecoins to complement the ""meme stocks"" phenomenon.It might like in last January.
First, $GME and $AMC pumping...
And then main cryptos + altcoins.Most of the major cryptocurrencies were flat on June 3, however, with Dogecoin (DOGE), the meme star of much of 2021, down around 1.5%."
652,"It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the need for candidates specializing in cryptocurrency and blockchain has become more apparent than ever before. This could be attributed to the fact that major companies are announcing job positions for candidates who are knowledgeable in alternative payments and emerging technologies.For example, global software giant Apple has recently announced plans to recruit a new business development manager with alternative payment experience. Other leading companies, such as PayPal, Venmo and Tesla, have also been seeking out talent with blockchain and cryptocurrency expertise.Several colleges and universities are offering specialized courses to help students better understand the blockchain ecosystem. For example, director of X-Labs and Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator Jocelyn Weber told Cointelegraph that there is an increasing demand for talent in this field, noting that the University of California, Berkeley is seeking to support the workforce of the future. As such, UC Berkeley will likely continue to expand course offerings in blockchain technology:Weber explained that UC Berkeley’s Building with Blockchain for Web 3.0 course allowed students to learn the entrepreneurial and technical skills needed to launch their own blockchain startup and pitch it to judges on a demo day. Parity Technologies — the company behind Polkadot — helped design the course curriculum and has even advised students hoping to launch their own startup.According to Weber, courses that include initiatives such as startup building are one of the ways UC Berkeley strives to bring the latest technologies and developments into its coursework. “This provides our students with the tools they need to enter the workforce with the most relevant knowledge,” she said.In addition to UC Berkeley, the University of Wyoming is also becoming a blockchain hotspot for education. Steven Lupien, director of the Center for Blockchain and Digital Innovation at the University of Wyoming, told Cointelegraph that UW has introduced a blockchain minor into its curriculum:Lupien is aware of the impact that digital assets are having on businesses. He noted that it’s the responsibility of educational leaders to prepare students to become productive members of the work community. “It’s important for them to understand this technology and its applied use cases and how it will impact their futures,” Lupien said.It’s also noteworthy to point out that courses focused on financial literacy around cryptocurrency are being offered to students as well. Most recently, Electric Coin Company — the company behind the cryptocurrency Zcash (ZEC) — partnered with the Bronx Community College on a pilot program called “Crypto in Context,” which specializes in understanding cryptocurrency in the real world.Andre Serrano, strategic partnerships at Electric Coin Company, told Cointelegraph that some of the most successful products in the industry are built and used by people who have already benefited from the current financial system. However, Serrano mentioned that “Crypto in Context” was created on the premise that others can learn from and build alongside the communities who have been most impacted by the failures of today’s status quo:Serrano shared that “Crypto in Context” was open to all students and faculty at Bronx Community College, noting that 25 students have registered for the free virtual course. He also remarked that 70% of the program participants were female, coming from a range of academic backgrounds. This is notable, especially as the number of female crypto investors continues to grow.In addition, Serrano mentioned that 80% of the students enrolled in the course downloaded a digital currency wallet. “Over the course of six weeks, students earned a total of 2.3 ZEC for completing tasks and optional assignments,” he said.While blockchain and cryptocurrency courses are important for industry growth and adoption, it may be too soon to understand how these learnings will impact students looking for jobs in the field. For instance, candidates applying for positions at Apple or PayPal may come from traditional finance backgrounds yet have little knowledge of crypto simply because it’s so new.Although this may be the case today, some industry innovators are hopeful that cryptocurrency and blockchain courses will help bring in better talent moving forward. Nilesh Khaitan, crypto lead at Venmo, told Cointelegraph that a lack of awareness and overall knowledge about crypto is the number one problem when it comes to the adoption of digital assets:Khaitan further pointed out that there are a number of non-engineering role job opportunities in the crypto space, such as business development, community marketing and more. “Having a non-tech curriculum is equally important to drive the knowledge of crypto without diving into the deep technical aspects of it,” he commented.Moreover, blockchain and cryptocurrency courses can be beneficial for those already familiar with the space. Guy Malone, a certified Bitcoin professional, told Cointelegraph that he recently completed the University of Nicosia’s Introduction to Digital Currencies course. According to Malone, although he understood the importance of Bitcoin (BTC), he wanted to take a deeper dive into crypto by taking courses:Although useful, it may take some time for all major universities and colleges to start offering blockchain and cryptocurrency courses. For example, Lupien noted that limited resources are a challenge for universities looking to expand their curriculum. “As a nascent technology, there are few faculty that have both the academic credentials as well as the experience to effectively teach this technology — but that is changing rapidly,” Lupien said.Moreover, students might question the relevance of these courses due to the fact that crypto and blockchain aren’t entirely mainstream. Piergiacomo Palmisani, vice president of the Blockchain Acceleration Foundation — a nonprofit organization helping universities incorporate blockchain curriculum — told Cointelegraph that for students, the challenge is to get them interested enough to choose a career in blockchain over a safe and well-paid job in tech, finance or any other field. “I believe that, as more success stories come out of the crypto industry, students will be more attracted to it,” he said.As for the universities and colleges already offering blockchain and crypto courses, advancements seem to be underway. Weber shared that while UC Berkeley doesn’t have plans to offer students a degree in blockchain technology currently, there is a possibility moving forward: “I would never rule it out as a future possibility, especially as a minor offering.”"
653,"Francis Suarez, the crypto-friendly mayor of the city of Miami, may have further cemented his status as a cryptocurrency proponent.Appearing on the CNBC Squawk Box program, Suarez revealed that he owns both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).""I own #bitcoin and I own #ethereum,"" says @FrancisSuarez. ""I haven't bought the dip yet but I'm planning to. I've just been too busy."" pic.twitter.com/xdKpghIRR5According to Suarez, he bought BTC and ETH immediately after the United States Senate passed the $1.9-trillion stimulus bill for further COVID-19 relief back in early March.For Suarez, the passage of the bill made inflation an inevitability, stating, “I knew at that point that inflation was inevitable and that there had to be some sort of a hedge.”Massive government spending to spur economic recovery continues to stoke inflation and monetary debasement fears further lending credence to Bitcoin’s viability as a hedge asset.At the time of stimulus bill passage, Bitcoin rocketed past $54,000 on the road to reaching its current all-time high above $64,000. BTC along with the crypto market did experience significant losses in May, with token prices sliding almost 50% across the board.Suarez said he was unable to take advantage of the current dip, adding:Miami is also fast becoming a major crypto hub in the United States, with venture capital firm Borderless Capital announcing a $25-million fund for startups based in the city.From nightclubs to tax payments, crypto adoption seems to be growing at a significant pace across the city, with the mayor even calling for progressive cryptocurrency laws back in February.Miami’s footprint in the cryptocurrency landscape appears set for another boost as the city plays host to the Bitcoin 2021 conference. Congresspeople, CEOs, celebrities and cryptographers are among the over 50,000 crypto faithful expected to grace the event."
654,"Update: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that capital inflows into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust declined due to a lack of Wall Street interest. However, Seres Lu, vice president of Grayscale, updated Cointelegraph via email that the capital inflow stopped because the firm closed some of its trusts for administrative purposes. The article has been updated accordingly. There is a reason why Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) emerged as a benchmark to measure institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC).The digital currency investment product was among the only ones that offered hedge funds, endowments, pension funds and family offices a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without needing them to own the digital asset themselves.Therefore, a rising capital inflow into GBTC — such as the one reported last year, wherein Wall Street investors deposited about $18.2 billion in the fund — served as a metric to gauge growing institutional interest in the crypto sector. Conversely, a declining capital inflow reflected institutional withdrawal or profit-taking, like the one happening since the first quarter of 2021.On-chain analytics service Skew reported Thursday that GBTC stopped attracting fresh investments after February 2021.The GBTC premium was upward of 30% at the beginning of this year. But the latest Skew chart pinpoints it at -11.40%. GBTC’s premium to its NAV was –40.20% at its sessional low, its worst level in history.Seres Lu, vice president of Grayscale Investments, updated Cointelegraph that the firm closed its various trusts for new investments. He said:Meanwhile, GBTC premium logged mild recoveries in early April after Grayscale announced its intentions to convert its trust structure to an exchange-traded fund. The New York firm’s decision came in the wake of growing competition from then-newly launched ETFs in Canada, primarily as they offered better expense ratios than Grayscale’s.For instance, Purpose, the world’s first physically settled Bitcoin ETF, surfaced with an expense ratio of 1%. Evolve and CI Galaxy, other Canadian Bitcoin ETFs, offered 0.75% and 0.40%, respectively. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s expense ratio was a heightened 2%.Business rivalries with Canadian Bitcoin ETFs might have also choked capital inflows into GBTC. Purpose, for instance, raked in $1 billion in capital per month after its launch in February, reflecting that demand for Bitcoin investment products remained higher despite a plunge in GBTC’s inflows.The period also saw Bitcoin’s spot rate riding higher on the Elon Musk factor. Following Tesla’s revelation that it was holding $1.5 billion worth of BTC on its balance sheets, the cost to purchase one Bitcoin rose from as low as $38,057 on Feb. 8 to as high as $64,899 on April 14, with speculators believing that more corporates would replace a portion of their cash holdings with the flagship cryptocurrency.But GBTC premium stayed negative during the course of Bitcoin’s February–April price rally. Its minus 40.20% bottom appeared when BTC/USD started shedding its gains owing to profit-taking, China’s crypto ban and Tesla’s Bitcoin dump rumors.Daniel Martins, founder of independent research firm DM Martins Research, highlighted the decline as a sign of waning Wall Street interest in Bitcoin-related investments, especially after the cryptocurrency became a clear victim of Musk’s anti-Bitcoin tweets mid-May, losing more than half its valuation at one point later.Martins further noted that Grayscale reported 500% higher annualized returns than Nasdaq, but its correction was also worse than the 2008’s recession — 82% vs. Nasdaq’s 17%. That made Grayscale’s Bitcoin investment product an “ultra-leveraged bet,” accompanied by an inferior risk-adjusted performance. The analyst added:Martins’ statements highlighted possibilities that GBTC premium could face further downside moves as investors hunt for more stable alternatives against Bitcoin’s ongoing price correction.Moreover, its rivalry from other digital currency investment alternatives, including cryptocurrency custodian services that offer institutional investors to own real crypto assets at a cheaper fee, further risks limited capital inflow.ETF.com’s analyst Sumit Roy wrote that the Grayscale fund’s potential transition into an ETF ends its 2%-fee days, as it would need to compete with an army of other ETFs, led by firms such as Bitwise, Vanguard, Fidelity, Cboe and others. He added:But whether the United States markets will have access to a Bitcoin ETF in 2021 remains a mystery itself. Financial Times reported earlier this week that most ETF applications gather dust as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler reiterated worries about investor protection in crypto markets.“I expect that [delay] to happen with all of our filings, to be honest,” said Laura Morrison, global head of listings at Cboe."
655,"Tinkoff, a major private bank in Russia, is struggling to offer cryptocurrency trading to its clients due to the central bank’s tough stance on digital assets.Tinkoff CEO Oliver Hughes said that the digital bank is willing to offer crypto trading services but is restrained by the Bank of Russia’s policies, CNBC reported. The executive announced the news at the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum on Thursday, stating:Hughes said that the bank has seen growing demand from its customers to invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), noting that there are “qualified investors who know what they’re doing.” The CEO noted that there are still certain concerns over the use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and high volatility risks.“Hopefully, over time, this will evolve, and we’ll be able to achieve the aims of the central bank, making sure there’s no money laundering issues, making sure we’re protecting investors, but also offer products in a responsible way,” Hughes said.Tinkoff is one of the most popular banks in Russia, ranked the third top bank by demand after state-backed Sberbank and VTB as of September 2020, according to a study by Deloitte. The bank is known for its service “Tinkoff Investments,” which allows private investors to invest in products such as stocks, bonds and currencies.In February, a spokesperson for Tinkoff Investments told Cointelegraph that Tinkoff was not planning to launch cryptocurrency trading because the “legal status of crypto in Russia was not determined yet.” “In legal terms, crypto is not money, not property, not information and not a means of payment,” the representative said.Russia officially adopted its major cryptocurrency law, “On Digital Financial Assets,” in January this year. Last month, local regulators initiated a partial lift on the Russian ban of crypto payments as the DFA prohibits the use of crypto as a payment method."
656,"Anatoly Aksakov, a member of Russia’s State Duma and a key spokesman for the country’s cryptocurrency legislation process, claimed that he has never owned any Bitcoin (BTC).Aksakov said that he doesn’t hold any Bitcoin and likely won't, as the government has prohibited officials from purchasing crypto, local news agency TASS reported on Thursday.The official went on to say that he was willing to buy some Bitcoin as an investment before the ban came into force last year. However, he thought that the price was too high at the time:In the interview, Aksakov also argued that Bitcoin should not be available to unqualified investors due to its extreme volatility. He also touched upon the development of Russia’s crypto tax regime, noting that crypto tax reports are currently made on a voluntary basis, as a draft bill that would make reporting mandatory has only passed its first reading in parliament.Aksakov is a major financial official in Russia who serves as chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Markets as well as a member of the Bank of Russia’s National Banking Council. He has emerged as a major Bitcoin critic, predicting last year that BTC had no future. Aksakov’s remarks come shortly after another regulatory initiative suggested to partially lift the country’s ban on crypto payments in late May. The country officially enforced the ban in January as part of its major cryptocurrency law, “On Digital Financial Assets.”"
657,"Bitcoin (BTC) edged closer to $40,000 on Thursday as bulls gathered increasing signals that the bottom is in.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD retaining levels it reclaimed a day before, including the critical $37,500.Now, eyes were on the coming days for confirmation of a breakout or rejection — volatility was already forecast to enter by the weekend.For popular trader Crypto Ed, the market might need another bearish test in the short term before coming back with a vengeance. In the meantime, it may be a case of grinning and bearing familiar moves.“I think we’re close to a reversal and a correction during the day before up again,” he told Twitter followers on Thursday.He added that he assumed that BTC/USD is going to correct rather than continue upward.Meanwhile, two new metrics that specifically try to catch Bitcoin price bottoms went live on monitoring resource Glassnode this week in a timely release for traders.Created by David Puell, well known for his famous Puell Multiple indicator, delta cap and balanced price both provided cues that Bitcoin may already be in recovery.“Watch out for confluence on these in the next bear,” Puell added.As Cointelegraph reported, opinions continue to focus on this year seeing a double top pattern on Bitcoin similar to 2013.In both previous bull markets, major retracements from local highs were standard on the way to ultimate peaks; and as such, there is nothing unusual about current behavior. That was the opinion of stock-to-flow creator PlanB this week in conversation with podcast host Preston Pysh."
658,"A recent court ruling said that video hosting giant YouTube is not responsible for cryptocurrency-related scams posted on its platform.Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak failed to support his lawsuit against YouTube over an advert using his image to promote a fake Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway, Bloomberg reports.Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Sunil Kulkarnia said in a tentative ruling Wednesday that YouTube and its parent firm Google are protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — a federal law shielding internet platforms from responsibility for content posted by users.Wozniak sued YouTube in July last year over a typical bogus crypto giveaway that stated that anyone who sends cryptocurrency to a certain address will receive more cryptocurrency in return. The Apple co-founder argued that YouTube not only failed to remove the fraudulent ads but “materially contributed” to the scam by selling targeted ads driving traffic to the videos and falsely verifying the YouTube channels that carried the videos.“If YouTube had acted quickly to stop this to a reasonable extent, we would not be here now. What human would see posts like these and not ban them as criminals immediately?” he said. In the suit, Wozniak reportedly noted that similar crypto scams on YouTube also capitalized on other tech celebrities like Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.However, Judge Kulkarnia said that those factors were not enough to challenge the immunity provided by Section 230. The judge gave Wozniak 30 days to try to revise his complaint.Wozniak is not the first entrepreneur to lose his battle against bogus YouTube ads. Last July, YouTube lawyers filed a dismissal bid in a similar case brought by major crypto firm Ripple Labs, arguing that the platform was not liable for any content — including scams — provided by third parties.The latest court ruling comes the same day Google overturned its 2018 policy banning crypto exchanges from using its advertising services."
659,"Bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto is set to be depicted in a life-size bronze statue in Budapest, the capital city of Hungary.According to local news outlet Hungary Today, sculptors, Réka Gergely and Tamás Gilly are designing the statue, and have unveiled initial plans depicting a figure with a featureless face wearing a Bitcoin hoodie.The hood is over the figure's head, and the face will be made from a reflective surface so that viewers can see themselves mirrored back when they look at the statue — emphasizing the idea that “we are all Satoshi.”The project was initiated by crypto enthusiast András Györfi. Speaking with Hungary Today, he emphasized the benefits that Bitcoin and blockchain tech offer to the world:The project has been financed by four organizations, Mr. Coin, Crypto Academy, Blockchain Hungary Association, and Blockchain Budapest.The statue is set to be erected in Graphisoft Park in Budapest’s 3rd district, which already has a statue depicting Apple founder Steve Jobs in his signature look of jeans, a turtleneck, and sneakers. It was commissioned as a tribute to Jobs from Graphisoft, a Hungarian software firm that Jobs’ invested in as a start-up in the mid-1980s.This is not the first public monument to be created in celebration of crypto culture — back in 2018 the Slovenian city of Kraj unveiled a Bitcoin monument in the center of a roundabout near the city’s courthouse.The monument consists of a horizontal seven-meter-wide steel ring with the Bitcoin logo in the center. The project was financed by Luxembourg-based crypto exchange Bitstamp and blockchain software firm 3fsHungary appears to be warming up to crypto across the board, after the government revealed plans on May 11 to cut taxes on crypto trading from 30.5%, down to 15% as part of an economic recovery program post-pandemic."
660,"The cryptocurrency faithful got a reprieve from recent market struggles thanks to a rally in decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens and Dogecoin (DOGE) on June 2. A bit of a breakout in the price of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) may have also lifted sentiment, but at the moment, the top-ranked digital assets are still meeting pushback at key overhead resistance levels. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin rallied 7.3% from a low of $35,645 on June 1 to an intraday high at $38,250 on June 2, and Ether saw a similar-sized gain of 7.7% to briefly regain the $2,800 support level.While the uptick in prices has many calling for a continuation of the 2021 bull market, some analysts have highlighted a possible bearish pennant formation on the Bitcoin chart, which could result in a price breakdown to as low as $16,000.Bitcoin’s volatile price action over the past month has led many to speculate on whether the top is in for BTC or the current correction is just a mid-cycle breather that will prepare the asset for continuation once the rally resumes. Deeper insight into the matter was provided in a recent Delphi Digital report that discussed the MVRV ratio, an on-chain metric that measures Bitcoin’s market value (MV) against its realized value (RV) as an indicator that can help traders determine market tops and bottoms.The chart above shows that the MVRV ratio became overextended in early 2011, late 2013 and early 2018, “all of which represented cycle tops,” as highlighted by Delphi Digital. The researchers also suggested that “May 2021’s reading could very well indicate the top for this cycle.”While it is possible that the top may be in for the current cycle, Delphi Digital also noted that there is the potential for the market to “see an outcome that resembles 2013’s 'double bubble' where BTC made an ATH [all-time high], price fell hard, and then recovered well past the ATH in the same year.”The report further highlighted the fact that the threshold for determining Bitcoin’s bottom has increased over time, which could change the landscape of bull markets in the years ahead.According to Delphi Digital:As a note of caution, the report did point out that while “There’s a lot of conflicting data and sentiment” in the market currently, there is likely to be “an episode of mean reversion in coming weeks as price deviated far from its 50 day moving average.”Altcoins notched double-digit gains during June 2’s price action, led by a 53% gain in the price of Kyber Network's KNC token, which is now back above $2.50. KAVA also secured a 37% rally and currently trades near $4.70.Dogecoin, Kusama's KSM token and Curve DAO's CRV token also helped lead the altcoin charge, with price rallies around 25%, while OKB put on a 33% gain and trades near $17.70.The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.709 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 41.5%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

661,"On June 4, a total of 15,530 Bitcoin (BTC) options are set to expire, which represents $575 million in open interest. At the moment, bulls are still heavily impacted by May's 37% BTC price correction, and this has led most call (buy) options to be underwater.Despite the crash, Bitcoin's active supply reached a five-month low, as 45% of the coins have not been moved over the past two years. This indicator shows that investors who purchased up until the 2019 bull run are unwilling to sell at the current prices.Miners are also avoiding sales below $40,000, as their outflows recently reached a seven-month low relative to the historical average.In the meantime, technical analysts pointed to the 50-week exponential moving average as a strong support level close to $34,000. Still, the price chart has been forming a pattern of sideways trading that is culminating in a narrowing wedge and breakout — known as ""compression"" — and indicating higher volatility toward the end of the week.What is clear is that the market is a mixed bag right now, and everyone is grasping at various signals as an attempt to pinpoint the direction of the next trending move.While bears could have easily dominated Friday's expiry, it seems they became overconfident by focusing primarily on sub-$32,000 put (sell) options.The initial picture favors bears, as the call-to-put ratio stands at 0.84, although this indicator values every option the same. However, the right to acquire Bitcoin at $46,000 in less than 42 hours is currently worthless, so this call option is trading below $20 each.A similar effect is in place for the neutral-to-bearish put options at $28,000 and lower. Holders have no benefit in rolling it over for the upcoming weeks, as these contracts also became worthless. Therefore, to better assess how traders are positioned for Friday's options expiry, one needs to concentrate on the $32,000–$42,000 range.The neutral-to-bull call options up to $42,000 amount to 3,080 Bitcoin contracts, representing $114 million in open interest. On the other hand, put (sell) options down to $32,000 encompass 4,680 Bitcoin contracts, currently worth $173 million.As expected, the $60 million difference favoring bears is not enough to cause any disturbance. This situation was caused by excessively bearish bets that did not pay off, potentially leading to the first balanced options expiry in three weeks.The 25% delta skew provides a reliable, instant ""fear and greed"" analysis. This indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options side by side and will turn positive when the neutral-to-bearish put options premium is higher than similar-risk call options. This situation is usually considered a ""fear"" scenario, although it's frequent after solid rallies.On the other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of upside protection and points toward bullishness.Since May 17, the indicator has flipped to the ""fear"" range on multiple occasions and peaked at 20%, signaling a lack of interest to offer protective puts.There is no doubt that bulls are frightened, but historically, those are the best opportunities to buy the dip.At least for the June 4 options expiry, bears no longer dominate the trade.

662,"Weary cryptocurrency traders awoke to the sight of green in the markets on May 2, as bulls managed to bid the price of Bitcoin (BTC) above the crucial “line in the sand” resistance at $37,500, while Ether (ETH) briefly traded at $2,800.The rising price of both BTC and ETH has been accompanied by double-digit gains in multiple altcoins, leading some to speculate that the market is currently experiencing an oversold bounce following the recent downturn.The leader of the pack for this most recent rally is once again Dogecoin (DOGE), which rallied 28% to an intraday high at $0.4446 following the June 1 announcement that the token would be listed on Coinbase Pro and renewed Twitter promotion from Elon Musk.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect the bullish turn for DOGE on May 31, prior to the recent price rise and ahead of the Coinbase Pro announcement.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for DOGE began to register green on May 31 and reached a high of 74 on June 1, just 14 hours before the system registered the NewsQuake™ announcement of DOGE being listed on Coinbase Pro, which was followed by a 45% rally.Cointelegraph Markets Pro data for Kyber Network’s KNC token shows that market conditions for the project have been favorable for some time.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for KNC shifted into the green zone on May 31 and stayed elevated for the next two days before reaching a high of 74 on June 1 when its price began a 75% rally.Another DeFi-focused project that was identified by Cointelegraph Markets Pro ahead of its recent price move is Kava, which has gained 36% in the past 24 hours and currently trades at $4.68.As seen in the chart above, conditions for KAVA have been bullish for some time, as evidenced by the sustained green VORTECS™ Score over the past week. The VORTECS™ Score for KAVA reached a high of 75 on May 31, roughly 48 hours before starting a 45% price rally.The May 19 correction wiped out $1.2 trillion in value across the crypto market, and while shockwaves from the historic correction are still reverberating throughout the market, a handful of DeFi tokens and altcoins are beginning to show signs of bullish momentum. This suggests that cautious traders are slowly easing their way back into the market in hopes that the second leg of the 2021 bull market could be underway.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

663,"Across Poland, an NFT developer’s SIM cards are turning mobile phones into a key that opens up the smart cities of tomorrow.Blockchain developer SmartKey’s Live Objects technology is using non-fungible tokens and the Internet of Things to create a smart technology network that can manage bike sharing systems, read electric meters, and even unlock doors for emergency services workers.Working with the major European mobile service provider Orange in 80 cities across Poland, Live Objects is building a Blockchain Internet of Things (BIoT) to become the infrastructure provider of choice for smart cities of the future.Far from being another key fob like the ones that turn on car engines, Live Objects lives directly on the SIM card in every mobile device, which means any Orange device connected to the SmartKey blockchain network — which is publicly available — is able generate and distribute standardized smart NFTs usable in any Orange device worldwide.“To enable Blockchain of Things devices to operate within the smart city of the future, we created a universal communication standard to connect devices over short distances,” says Szymon Fiedorowicz, CEO and co-founder of SmartKey. “This cooperation with Orange, the leader of urban IoT services in Poland, will help our solution become a connective tissue for smart cities and cement our role in the smart city of the future.”The technology, Fiedorowicz adds, will “open up a world of new possibilities of using the Internet of Things.”NFTs are at the heart of SmartKey’s Ethereum-based technology, providing a unique token — a virtual key — that in combination with Orange network’s security standards prevent unauthorized acts as a proof of ownership for smart city IoT functions. Thanks to blockchain technology, that virtual key is programmable, interoperable and transferable, but not cloneable or reprogrammable. So, an NFT could provide service workers like a plumber — or a plumbing firm — access to an apartment for a single day.Orange’s SmartKey-enabled mobiles will be able to handle more complex device control tasks. A car share program could use Live Object NFTs to not only let renters turn on the car but control access to it based on anything from the time of day to whether the users’ account is paid up to date. It could also automatically close out the rental when it is returned to a garage and even add a charge if the gas tank wasn’t refilled.The flexibility of the SmartKey NFTs make the technology suitable for a wide range of urban and commercial services, ranging from parking lots and public transportation to the loading and refueling of trucks, and even the fledgling distributed energy market.Smart devices are not a new idea anymore — there are two million of them connected by Orange machine-to-machine cards in Poland alone, says Sebastian Grabowski, director of IoT and advanced technologies at Orange.“However, even a wide range of such devices does not create a network in itself, just as a collection of houses does not create a city,” Grabowski explains. “We also need an infrastructure that connects IoT technology with the end user, and this is what blockchain provides.”This combination, he adds, “is a real revolution not only in the world of technology, but also in the global economy.”Disclaimer.

664,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) active supply — coins that have moved in the past two years or earlier — dropped to a five-month low of 44.5% on June 2, according to data from Glassnode. This indicates that investors who had purchased Bitcoin more than two years ago are not keen to sell after the 40% drop.Even miners, who sold during the May correction have since reversed their decision. The outflows from miner addresses are at the lowest level in seven months, which suggests that miners are holding on to their Bitcoin.Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes that Bitcoin’s correction could extend below $30,000. Brandt said that every 50% fall in Bitcoin’s history has stretched to 70%. He also highlighted that according to past precedence, Bitcoin is unlikely to hit a new all-time high within seven months of a 50% correction.However, PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow-based Bitcoin price models, believes a further sharp fall below $30,000 is unlikely. He also remains positive on the prospects of Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high this year.At the moment, analysts are divided in their opinion on Bitcoin’s short-term price action. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the path of least resistance.Bitcoin continues to trade inside a symmetrical triangle pattern as the bulls and the bears battle it out to establish their supremacy. Although the symmetrical triangle generally acts as a continuation pattern, it is difficult to predict with certainty until the price breaks out of the triangle.The downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in the negative territory suggest that bears have the upper hand. If the BTC/USDT pair breaks below the triangle, the bearish momentum could pick up. There is a minor support at $28,000 but if that also cracks, the pair could retest the $20,000 level.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the triangle. If that happens, it will suggest that bulls have overpowered the bears. The pair could then attempt a rally to the 50-day simple moving average ($49,201).This level may again act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls propel the price above it, the pair will signal that the downtrend could be over.Ether (ETH) turned down from the 20-day exponential moving average ($2,762) on June 1 but the positive sign is that the bulls did not give up much ground. This suggests that the buyers did not hurry to close their positions.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has risen near the midpoint, indicating that the selling pressure has reduced.If buyers drive and sustain the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could start a relief rally that may reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,362.72 and then the 78.6% retracement level at $3,806.91.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the triangle, the pair may consolidate inside the triangle for a few more days. A breakdown and close below the triangle will indicate advantage to the bears.Binance Coin (BNB) has risen above the 20-day EMA ($399) but it could face stiff resistance at $423.83. If the price turns down from this overhead resistance, the bulls will try to arrest the decline at the trendline.If they succeed, it will suggest the bulls are attempting to form a higher low. This will increase the possibility of a break above $423.83. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($505). A breakout of this resistance will suggest the downtrend may be over.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and plummets below the trendline, it will suggest the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. The pair could then retest the critical support at $211.70.Cardano (ADA) broke above the downtrend line on June 1 and the bulls are trying to extend the relief rally above $2 today. The 20-day EMA ($1.64) has started to turn up and the RSI is trading above 54, suggesting that the bulls have the upper hand.If buyers succeed in pushing the price above $2, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to the all-time high at $2.47.On the other hand, if the price turns down from $2, the bears will try to pull the price back below the downtrend line. If that happens, it will suggest that buying dries up at higher levels. The pair could then drop to the 50-day SMA ($1.52).A breakdown and close below the 50-day SMA could attract further selling and the pair may drop to $1.33 and later to $1.Dogecoin (DOGE) broke above the downtrend line on May 31 and cleared the 20-day EMA ($0.37) hurdle today. The RSI has jumped into the positive territory and the 20-day EMA has started to turn up, suggesting the bulls are making a comeback.If buyers propel the price above $0.47, the DOGE/USDT pair could pick up further momentum and rise to $0.59.Conversely, if the price turns down from $0.47, the pair could correct to the 20-day EMA. If this support holds, it will suggest the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then make one more attempt to push the price above $0.47.However, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $0.28 and then to $0.21.The bulls tried to push XRP above the 20-day EMA ($1.07) on June 1 but met with stiff resistance from the bears. However, the buyers did not give up much ground, indicating strength.The bulls will again try to thrust and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the XRP/USDT pair could start its relief rally to the 50-day SMA ($1.30) and then to the downtrend line.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the pair could again drop to the $0.88 to $0.80 support zone. A break below this zone could result in a retest of the May 23 low at $0.65.Polkadot (DOT) is inching towards the overhead resistance at $26.50. The price had turned down from this resistance on May 28, hence the bears are again likely to defend this level aggressively.If the DOT/USDT pair turns down from $26.50 but bounces off the trendline, it will suggest that bulls are accumulating on dips.That could result in the formation of a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $26.50. The pattern target of this setup is $35.91.Alternatively, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, the pair could drop to the support at $15. A strong rebound off this support will suggest a few days of range-bound action between $15 and $26.50.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($28.41) on June 1 but the positive sign is that the bulls did not allow the price to drift down. The buyers are again trying to push the price above the 20-day EMA today.The repeated retest of a resistance level tends to weaken it. The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has risen above 48, indicating the selling pressure has reduced.If buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA and $30, the UNI/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($33.67). A breakout of this resistance could signal an end of the downtrend.Conversely, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plunges below $25.94, the bears will attempt to pull the pair down to $21.50. A breakdown and close below this support will suggest that the bears have reasserted their supremacy.Internet Computer (ICP) remains weak as the bulls have not been able to push the price back above $120 in the past five days. This suggests a lack of aggressive buying even at the current levels.If the bears sink and sustain the price below the $103.71 support, the ICP/USDT pair could resume its downtrend and challenge the May 19 low at $86. If this support cracks, the pair may drop to $60.On the contrary, if bulls propel and sustain the price above $120, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. That may clear the path for an up-move to $168.If the price turns down from this resistance, a few days of range-bound action is likely. The pair could pick up bullish momentum on a breakout and close above $168.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rose above $685.36 on May 31. The bears tried to pull the price back below the level on June 1 but they could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests buyers are trying to form a higher low.The relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($801). If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the BCH/USDT pair below the $685 to $600 support zone. If they succeed, the pair could retest the May 23 low at $468.13.Conversely, if bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the momentum could pick up and the pair may rally to the 50-day SMA ($958). This level may again act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls can thrust the price above it, the rally may extend to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,198.53.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

665,"Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded by more than 25% after bottoming out at $30,000 during the May 19 crash. But the cryptocurrency continues to tread ahead under the possibility of facing another period of strong sell-offs owing to a classic technical indicator pattern.Dubbed a “bearish pennant,” the pattern forms when an asset consolidates after a strong move downward and forms a small symmetrical triangle-like price range. It breaks below the range support and continues moving lower. Traders usually estimate the size of the negative breakout move by measuring the height of the earlier move.Bitcoin is currently trading inside a similar bearish pennant structure, fluctuating sideways as it forms a sequence of lower highs and higher lows. Meanwhile, its consolidation structure precedes a massive move downhill to around $20,000. Therefore, if the BTC/USD exchange rate breaks below the pennant structure and is accompanied by rising trade volumes, its likelihood of crashing by almost $20,000 is high.The bearish outlook also borrows cues from Bitcoin's recent bounce. It is worthy to take notice that the cost to purchase 1 BTC fell from almost $65,000 to $30,000 on May 19 — or by over 50% — followed by a considerable 30% bounce.Meanwhile, market analytics service Income Machine is warning of a ""dead cat bounce"" scenario emerging in the Bitcoin market, noting that upcoming rallies in BTC/USD could face limitations by further selling pressure near the May 26 highs (the $39,000–$41,000 area). It recommended traders exit their bullish positions near $40,000.What's more, Income Machine also noted that a failure to hold $30,000 as support would risk crashing Bitcoin prices to $16,200 — a level that coincides with the bearish pennant target. The analytics firm selected $16,200 because of its historical relevance as support during the November–December 2020 session.""Conversely, an upside break of the May 26 highs would cause us to reverse our analysis and adopt a more bullish outlook for BTC-USD,"" added Income Machine analysts.Pankaj Balani, chief executive and co-founder of crypto derivatives exchange Delta, also anticipated an extended bearish breakdown should Bitcoin’s price close below $34,000. Nevertheless, the former UBS official limited his downside target to $28,000, 2021's lowest level. He told Cointelegraph:Balani also noted that the current price action signifies demand in the $30,000–$35,000 range. Therefore, an upward swing from the said area could end up breaking the bearish pennant — which Balani referred to as a symmetrical triangle — to the upside.""BTC is forming a classic symmetric triangle and any breakout/breakdown will lead to a significant price move,"" he said, adding:"
666,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit $38,000 on June 2 as a long-awaited bout of volatility saw a critical bull level return.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD finally beating resistance at $37,500 on June 2, going on to hit local highs of $38,090.Questions were even being asked as to whether $30,000 would stay as support, with a potential further price dip set to take BTC to $20,000 — or worse.With the latest gains, however, the mood noticeably lifted.""Important update: past week I showed the bearish pennant and what are the possible scenarios... We just made a new high, meaning BTC is doing 5 legs up in this current move and opening the gates for more upside,"" popular trader Crypto Ed tweeted in his latest update.Crypto Ed was one of a number of traders calling for a bullish continuation for Bitcoin rather than a breakdown should $37,500 resistance be firmly quashed.That level represents a ""line in the sand"" for bulls, Cointelegraph reported, and flipping it to support would open up the path to higher crux levels at $40,000 and $42,000.Fellow trader Rekt Capital was cautious, arguing that the recovery needed ""sustained"" bullish activity to avoid defeat.He highlighted a so-called ""death cross"" pattern looming on the weekly chart, which signals downside in the form of two moving averages — the 50-week and the 200-week — crossing over one another.""A BTC Death Cross may or may not happen in the coming weeks. But that doesn't mean BTC can't rebound from current levels before then,"" he told Twitter followers.The move was significant for hodlers, who had watched as momentum failed to take Bitcoin higher than the lower end of its broad trading range with $30,000 as support.At the time of writing, BTC/USD traded at around $37,800, up 3.5% in the past 24 hours."
667,"Major global cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has launched a mobile crypto trading application in a new move to boost industry adoption in the United States.The company announced Wednesday that its new app is now available for most of the United States as well as other countries around the world for both iOS and Android users.The app allows users to trade more than 50 cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), via smartphones. The move follows a rollout of the Kraken mobile app in Europe this January.“This consumer app is our first major foray into supporting wider consumer adoption in a much more simplified, easy-to-use interface,” Kraken chief product officer Jeremy Welch noted.The new app launch comes amid Kraken trading volumes growing more than sixfold year-to-date as of May, Welch said. “The last five months have been pretty unreal at Kraken. We’ve seen a surge in new clients and in all-time highs,” he added.Launched in 2013, Kraken says that it has 7 million customers so far, making it one of the world’s largest crypto trading venues, competing with companies like Binance, Huobi and Coinbase. The exchange is ranked the fourth-largest cryptocurrency trading platform by daily trading volumes at the time of writing, according to data from CoinMarketCap.Kraken’s newly rolled-out app will not be supported all across the U.S., as the exchange does not offer services to residents of Washington and New York due to the “cost of maintaining regulatory compliance.” The company is registered as a money services business with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and says it complies “with legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions” of operation.The new availability comes less than two months after Kraken’s major rival exchange, Coinbase, went public on Nasdaq in April. Subsequently, major investment trust RIT Capital Partners acquired a stake in Kraken, with RIT executive James Glass noting that the crypto exchange is reportedly set to go public through a direct listing in 2022. Bloomberg reported in February that Kraken was in talks for new funding that could double its valuation to $10 billion."
668,"After an exceptional start to the year, the crypto market entered a bearish period in mid-May, causing some to reevaluate their stance on some of the fundamentals surrounding the crypto industry.The prolonged fall of Bitcoin (BTC) — by more than 50% — and the subsequent dip in mining difficulty by 16%, which are suspected to have been partially caused by news of China’s intention to take tough measures against crypto mining and trading, as well as Tesla’s decision to stop accepting Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles, have turned out to be a turning point that brought criticism of crypto to a new level.Against this background, some commentators and crypto enthusiasts have started talking about the possible end of the mining era. Or is it just a new beginning and a way for the industry to reinvent itself and make use of new solutions to appease the ever-expanding number of stakeholders?The first bell actually rang back in February this year, when buyers of GPU cards, whether they are miners or gamers, had begun talking about a severe shortage of available cards, which led to exorbitant price increases.For example, in the United States, some models of cards have risen in price by 120%. It should be noted, however, that the lack of components that make up the video cards have played an important role in such a price hike. What’s more, the slowdown in global supply chains on the back of COVID-19 restrictions has only exacerbated the already dire situation.Given the spread of hysteria surrounding the short supply of GPU cards, miners were looking for alternative ways of mining cryptocurrencies as new cryptocurrencies, such as Chia (XCH), appeared. Mining this cryptocurrency requires the use of a solid-state drive (SSD), which is used for storing user data on a personal computer and is several times cheaper than GPU cards.Chia uses free space on the device’s storage, and the more free gigabytes there are, the faster this cryptocurrency will be mined. In addition, Bram Cohen, creator of Chia Network, argued that his cryptocurrency is environmentally friendly compared to others because hard drives consume significantly less power than GPU cards, which means less harm to the environment. Of course, critics were quick to point out a key shortcoming of such a strategy, arguing that the lifespan of this equipment gets reduced to just 80–160 days, which means it must be constantly disposed of for something new.Despite an alternative to the GPU cards, the emergence of Chia has also inevitably led to a shortage of storage devices and an increase in their prices. In China, back in April, consumers began to buy hard disc drives with a capacity of 4–18 terabytes, while SSDs were also in hot demand. In Hong Kong, the excitement instantly provoked a rise in prices for these components; depending on the model, the cost increased by $25–$75.In the wake of price increases, GPU card manufacturers began to actively fend off crypto miners back in February. Spearheading the assault, Nvidia tried to prevent mining by releasing a special driver 470.05 for its RTX 3060 cards, which are widely used for mining Ether (ETH). However, the block did not work in most cases, as miners bypassed it using cheap plugs for HDMI ports that mimic the operation of a monitor.The unsuccessful attempt to limit the performance of GPU cards forced Nvidia to try a hardware block. At the end of May, the company announced a line of GPU cards called GeForce RTX 30 Lite Hash Rate. The GeForce RTX 30 LHR series includes video cards of the 3060, 3060 Ti, 3070 and 3080 series.Protection against mining on these cards is implemented at the hardware level: When Ether is mined, the performance drops by half, and the overall mining efficiency decreases by more than 50%. The start of sales was scheduled for late May to early June, but the company has not yet released this product.Nvidia’s partners have also joined the initiative by releasing GeForce RTX 30 LHR cards under their own brands, and Zotac was among the first. These cards are distinguished with a new marking so that buyers can differentiate the cards when buying one. Anti-mining cards have letters “GE” or “G” in the name, for example, Zotac RTX 3060-12GD6 Destroyer GE Pro.Moreover, at the end of May, PC manufacturer Asus registered the v2 series GPU card with the Eurasian Economic Commission. Most likely, this is how the company labels the LHR models, which have hardware and software protection against Ether mining.It is noteworthy that AMD, the only big competitor to Nvidia in the GPU cards market, has not yet reacted in any way to the attempts of its competitors to return the prices of gaming cards to their previous values. The company has announced no plans to release special anti-mining modifications of its accelerators. Meanwhile, the company said that it would not limit the computing power for mining cryptocurrency so that users can determine what to use the computing power of the GPU for.Having deprived crypto miners of using gaming cards, Nvidia simultaneously offered miners an alternative in the form of a series of CMP HX accelerators. These products are focused specifically on mining, which is expressed in the presence of a special crypto mining processor (CMP) and the complete absence of external interfaces. In other words, it’s simply impossible to connect a monitor to them — thus, it can’t be used for gaming.Asus CMP 40HX will be able to provide mining efficiency of up to 43.77 megahashes per second, while the official number announced by Nvidia stands at 36 MH/s. The 21% higher hash rate is due to memory and power consumption optimization of the video card.It was assumed that a specialized mining card CMP 40HX would go on sale before the end of the first quarter of this year. Like all other models of specialized video cards of the CMP HX series, they will be distributed by NVIDIA partners. Asus was the first to announce possible prices for such cards: CMP 40HX could cost $699 and the younger model, CMP 30HX, whose mining efficiency is 26 MH/s, around $599.AMD is also preparing a new GPU that will be designed for cryptocurrency mining. The cards will be based on Navi 10 and Navi 12 chips, which will be capable of mining Ether. AMD has stated that the new GPU would be released without VCN and Display Core Next DCN technologies, which will prevent them from streaming video to the display, once again, rendering them useless for gamers.Known manufacturers of other mining equipment are not sitting on the sidelines either. Sabrent announced at the end of May the sale of PlotRipper SSDs for Chia Coin miners. The main advantage of the new SSDs is their larger capacity, which will be used gradually as the drives wear out. The PlotRipper and PlotRipper Pro models contain 4TB and 8TB NAND chips, respectively.The desire of manufacturers to separate their mining cards from gaming ones is understandable, especially when the company is experiencing problems with resources for the production and tarnishes its image in the process.But in any production, the main thing is demand, which generates income. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, Nvidia made $155 million in revenue from the sales of GPUs designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining. In the second quarter of the fiscal year, it expects to generate $400 million.Related: Top crypto mining hardware to expect in 2021AMD also released its first-quarter report showing impressive revenue growth, recording a 93% rise to $3.45 billion over the same period last year. The management explained this dynamic by the surge in demand for consumer Ryzen processors and Radeon graphics cards. The average selling price has been rising in both the CPU and graphics segment. In fact, the revenue from the sales of client processors and their average price have reached record levels.Thus, if companies continue to make such profits, in which cryptocurrency mining plays an important role, then it is likely that chip manufacturers would be willing to cater to all avenues of customers with specialized products. It may actually be that mining is not only alive and well but, in the face of a sharp drop in crypto prices, may actually come out stronger as the result."
669,"United Kingdom based multinational banking and financial services company Standard Chartered (StanChart) is launching a cryptocurrency exchange, reports say.According to Reuters on June 2, StanChart has partnered with Hong Kong exchange owner BC Technology Group to launch a platform for the U.K. and European institutional market.The bank has long touted interest in the cryptocurrency sphere, and news of the launch follows various efforts to enter the crypto trading arena.The project will be handled by SC Ventures, the innovation arm of the bank, with no deadline for activities to begin yet named.""We have a strong conviction that digital assets are here to stay and will be adopted by the institutional market as a highly relevant asset class,"" Alex Manson, head of SC Ventures, told Reuters.StanChart thus becomes the latest mainstream financial player to pledge an interest in crypto trading. Its timing is conspicuous, coming after Bitcoin (BTC) shed 50% of its USD value, taking the majority of altcoins with it. Earlier, fellow banking giant HSBC publicly announced that it had no interest in entering the space, even as competitors seek to woo institutional clients with their own in-house offerings. Domestic banks in the United States, meanwhile, are expected to open up Bitcoin trading en masse by the end of the year. As Cointelegraph reported, meanwhile, pundits believe that it is ultimately a question of ""if,"" not ""when"" when it comes to legacy finance involvement.Raphael Polansky, managing director at Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures GmbH, told Cointelegraph last week that crypto custody will also see an continued stream of interest from traditional banks. Here, however, there may be more reluctance to put skin in the game.“We foresee a lot of strategic moves in the market where traditional banks will invest in crypto custodians instead of building up their own solutions,"" he said.For its part, StanChart launched a crypto custody venture, Zodia, at the end of 2020.""Zodia’s mission is to be a ‘force for good’ by lifting industry standards for digital assets in a sustainable, safe and responsible way,"" Manson said in a press release at the time. "
670,"Meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) gained more than 40% early on Wednesday morning, following its listing on Coinbase Pro and yet another flurry of tweets from self-appointed DOGE spokesperson Elon Musk.Coinbase announced the listing of Dogecoin on its pro trader platform, Coinbase Pro, on Tuesday, sparking a swift revival in the coin’s fortunes. DOGE’s price sank 59% over the course of the previous month, following the wider market crash in early March.On Tuesday, the coin’s price jumped from $0.3137 up to $0.4398 in the hours following the Coinbase announcement, resulting in 40% growth overnight.Coinbase is now accepting inbound deposits in anticipation of Dogecoin trading starting in earnest on Thursday, assuming enough liquidity is present. Trading will commence across five trading pairs: DOGE/USD, DOGE/BTC, DOGE/EUR, DOGE/GBP and DOGE/USDT.Tesla’s Musk may have lent further exposure to DOGE on Tuesday when he posted yet another Dogecoin meme.

671,"Global investment firm Guggenheim Investments has filed with the United States Securities and Exchange for a new fund that may seek exposure to Bitcoin (BTC).According to a Tuesday filing, the new Guggenheim Active Allocation Fund will be a diversified, closed-end management investment fund that may seek investment exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin through cash-settled derivatives instruments. Such instruments include exchange-traded futures, investment tools offering exposure to BTC as well as other cryptocurrencies through direct investments or indirect exposure such as derivatives contracts, the filing notes.The company stated that the fund’s exposure to crypto can result in substantial losses to the fund, citing a number of risks associated with the industry:According to the document, Guggenheim’s chief investment officer Scott Minerd will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the fund’s portfolio alongside assistant CIO Anne Bookwalter Walsh, managing director Steve Brown, and director Adam Bloch.Last year, Guggenheim placed another SEC filing, stating that its Guggenheim Macro Opportunities Fund may seek investment exposure to Bitcoin indirectly through investing up to 10% of its net asset value in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Minerd is known for his somewhat mixed stance on crypto and Bitcoin as the executive referred to the crypto market as “Tulipmania” after Bitcoin sank to nearly $30,000 on May 19. Despite comparing the crypto industry to a financial bubble, Minerd is still bullish on Bitcoin in the long term, predicting earlier this year that BTC can potentially hit $600,000."
672,"The CEO of Nasdaq-listed Canaan Inc, a China-based firm that specializes in Bitcoin (BTC) mining equipment, argued that China’s Bitcoin mining ban should make allowances for green-energy users during a conference call on Tuesday.Zhang Nangeng said that an indiscriminate ban on Bitcoin mining failed to take into account the potential economic benefits that could arise from embracing green-energy mining. Zhang stated that mining could present a solution to the oversupply of electricity in certain regions of the country, where resultant low energy prices already attract miners.“For-profit miners prefer regions with low electricity prices that indicate oversupply, and likely energy waste. Bitcoin miners also help create jobs in impoverished regions and contribute to fiscal coffers,” said Zhang.Canaan’s stock price increased 24% on Tuesday, adding to 42% growth for the week. The surge in Canaan’s share price came amid the release of the firm’s financial results for the first quarter of the year, which show spectacular growth since this time in 2020.The company’s revenue grew 490% year-on-year, primarily from the sale of its ASIC mining equipment. The company also recorded a net income of $22.4 million after recording a net loss of $5.9 million the year before.“Our financial performance improved significantly in the quarter, driven by the Bitcoin price rally, higher customer demand for quality mining machines, and our ability to ramp up mining machine production and deliveries,” wrote Nangeng in the quarterly report.The surge in the firm’s share price represents a swift turnaround after it sunk 41% over the course of the previous month amid the Bitcoin price drop. The firm’s business outlook predicted an increase in sales but stopped short of providing further financial guidance due to the volatility in the value of Bitcoin, which has a knock-on effect on mining demand.“The Company recognizes that the trends in Bitcoin prices are currently hard to predict and cannot provide financial guidance due to Bitcoin's price volatility in late May of this year,” the report stated."
673,"Jakarta-based crypto exchange Tokocrypto is considering a public market debut over the next two or three years, Nikkei reported on Wednesday.“I’m saying two years because we need to be profitable for at least more than two years before listing. We are already profitable now. Our key focus at Tokocrypto is to grow the business further, expand our operations to more parts of Indonesia and make crypto mainstream in the country,” Tokocrypto CEO Pang Xue Kai said.“Valuation-wise, it is premature to talk about as an IPO is still two to three years down the road, but a close reference would be Coinbase of the U.S. Currently, we are monitoring the market, scaling the business, building the team and products,” he added.Founded in 2018, Tokocrypto is regulated under Indonesia’s Ministry of Trade by the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency, also known as Bappebti.Tokocrypto has ties with the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, with the Indonesian firm receiving an undisclosed investment from Binance one year ago. Tokocrypto also launched a sale of its Tokocrypto (TKO) tokens on Binance earlier this year. Last year, the company also rolled out an upgraded crypto exchange powered by Binance Cloud.Indonesia has been emerging as a major hotspot for cryptocurrency activity recently despite the government banning crypto-based payments in 2017. Last week, a major local crypto trading platform, Pintu, raised $6 million from investors including Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase."
674,"Bitcoin (BTC) is less active than at any time this year, new data shows, as traders stubbornly refuse to sell.One metric from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode reveals that the Bitcoin supply is becoming less and less available despite lower prices.On Wednesday, Bitcoin’s active supply hit a five-month low of 44.5%.The number measures coins that have moved in the past two years or earlier — and the last time it measured that low, BTC/USD traded at around $22,000.The figure shows just how unattractive the idea of selling Bitcoin at current prices is to investors who purchased up until the 2019 bull run. As Cointelegraph reported, 2017 buyers already represent a strong cohort of “hodlers of last resort.”This goes some way to shoring up morale over future price action as various indicators including sentiment measure the Crypto Fear & Greed Index show a $36,000 Bitcoin appears undervalued.Nonetheless, the May sell-off ushered in a surge of newly liquid coins, something that managed to buck a two-year accumulation trend.“The magnitude of accumulation over the past two years is remarkable, however, the scale of the sell-pressure in May is also notable,” Glassnode wrote in a digest last week.Just as reluctant to sell, meanwhile, are miners. Relative to historical average, the outflows from miner addresses is now at a seven-month low.May’s action likewise triggered an uptick in sales, but this has since reversed — and is now at its lowest since November 2020, when Bitcoin traded around its all-time highs from 2017.Only retail traders are waiting in the wings for a potential switch-up as the balance of BTC on exchanges continues to climb after its mid-April bottom. This also coincides with the comedown from current all-time highs of nearly $65,000."
675,"Institutional demand for Ethereum continues to surge, with Ether products now representing more than one quarter of the assets under management (AUM) of crypto investment products.According to CoinShares’ June 1 Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly report, the past week saw significant institutional inflows of $74 million as investors sought to capitalize on the fall out from the recent crash in which many crypto assets lost more than 50% of their value.More than 63% of institutional inflows were injected into Ether products, or $46.8 million of the total. Ether products now represent 27% of the combined AUM for crypto investment products — the highest share yet.Significant inflows were also made to products offering exposure to multiple crypto assets ($11.1 million) as well as funds targeting Cardano ($5.2 million), XRP ($4.5 million), and Polkadot ($3.8 million).Outflows from Bitcoin products have slowed, with roughly $4 million in capital exiting the markets — down from last week’s $110.9 million in outflows. Over the past three weeks, $246 million has exited BTC investment products.Despite Bitcoin’s 30-day inflows of $47.9 million currently equating to roughly one-third of Ether’s $147.7 million, Bitcoin still dominates year-to-date inflows with nearly $4.4 billion compared to Ether’s $973 million.However, Ether’s recent momentum has given rise to renewed speculation as to whether Ethereum is gearing up to flip Bitcoin, with Ethereum currently beating out crypto’s honeybadger by transaction count, volume, and fees, and trade volume.According to CoinGecko, Ether is currently the second-most traded crypto asset with $38.8 billion in daily volume, ranking behind only Tether’s $103 billion. Roughly $32.9 worth of BTC changed hands over the past 24 hours."
676,"According to a survey, financial advisers are recommending investments in Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto assets to their clients more than ever before.A report by the Financial Planning Association released on Tuesday has taken a look at the changing attitudes toward crypto assets. The “2021 Trends in Investing Survey” revealed that more financial advisers than ever are recommending their clients have some crypto in their portfolios.The survey was conducted in March and received 529 online responses from professional financial advisers who offer clients investment advice and recommendations.It stated that 14% of financial advisers have already added crypto assets to their clients’ portfolios or are recommending it to them. Even more are planning to do so over the next year.The survey revealed that the figure is up significantly from the previous year, when less than 1% of advisers were recommending exposure to cryptocurrencies.Furthermore, 49% of finance professionals indicated that, in the last six months, clients have asked them about investing in cryptocurrencies, a figure that has almost trebled from just 17% in 2020.Just below half — 48% of financial advisers — claimed to occasionally read news stories on cryptocurrencies and are somewhat comfortable conversing about them, with one-third of advisrs actively educating themselves on digital assets.Clients appear to be less concerned with market volatility this year compared to last, the survey found. More than half — 52% — of financial advisers stated that their clients inquired about market volatility over the past six months, compared to 76% for the previous year.Investors may be drawn to crypto assets as a hedge against inflation, which has been exacerbated during the pandemic and ongoing fiscal stimulus packages. Inflation in the United States is hovering around a 13-year high.In early May, Cointelegraph reported that financial advisers have been leading an institutional push toward crypto-asset adoption.Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told Cointelegraph that “curiosity and demand from clients are driving financial adviser interest in crypto.” His observations were derived from a survey commissioned by the investment firm showing that more than half of the surveyed advisers are receiving questions from their clients about cryptocurrencies."
677,"Cryptocurrency investment manager ETC Group is expanding its Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded product (ETP) offering in the United Kingdom after harnessing Swiss market rules to bypass more stringent British regulations. The ETC Group Physical Bitcoin ETP, which trades under the ticker symbol BTCE, will begin trading on Aquis Exchange in London and Paris on June 7, the company announced Tuesday. Once launched, BTCE will become the first cryptocurrency ETP to trade in the United Kingdom.Bradley Duke, CEO of ETC Group, said the product is already being used by investors as an “effective hedge against inflation.” He explained:Alasdair Haynes, CEO of Aquis Exchange, described cryptocurrency as a “bona fide asset class” that gives investors more options for achieving a balanced portfolio. “Aquis has a history of innovation and is responding to client demand for these assets in an agile way allowing traders to access them in a liquid, regulated environment,” he said.Since launching its Bitcoin ETP in Germany in June 2020, ETC Group has traded $5.4 billion worth of cryptocurrencies, underscoring the continued growth of digital-asset investing among institutions.The arrival of so-called smart money investors has catapulted Bitcoin and other digital currencies into the limelight. However, their involvement in the market has added another layer of uncertainty to Bitcoin’s post-halving price targets. As Cointelegraph recently reported, much of the selling going on in BTC markets recently has come at the hands of new entrants.Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, fund issuers are lining up to convince the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to finally approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Six high-profile funds are currently under review by the U.S. securities regulator, with the first decision scheduled for later this month."
678,"Bitcoin (BTC) is nearing the end of a consolidation period, which traders are betting will spark a fresh bullish breakout.In a tweet on Tuesday, popular trader Crypto Ed became the latest voice in the expanding bullish movement calling time on lower BTC price levels.After consolidating in a broad range since hitting $30,000, BTC/USD is printing higher lows and lower highs on lower timeframes.This narrowing wedge on the chart has a logical endpoint where volatility becomes practically zero — and historically, this results in a major move up or down.“Expecting that bounce any moment now,” Crypto Ed summarized.He added that a failure to break out could have the opposite effect, a nod to those already warning over a possible fresh bearish dip toward $20,000.A look at the hourly chart, meanwhile, dictates a make-or-break moment for Bitcoin on Wednesday, at which point market trajectory in the near term should be decided.“Expect volatility by week’s end,” fellow trader Lark Davis added.The pattern of sideways trading following a major price move that culminates in a narrowing wedge and breakout — known as “compression” — is a classic chart phenomenon for Bitcoin. The process characterized much of 2020 in particular before the bull market truly kicked in to take BTC/USD past its 2017 all-time highs.For Rekt Capital, meanwhile, an essential long-term chart feature is of interest following the $30,000 dip.Bitcoin’s 50-week exponential moving average (WEMA) is back as support despite overall lower levels, and historically, this has been a key bull flag.“In a sustained bull market, you can have a crash period which is very deep, but as long as this crash period maintains itself above this indicator of bullish momentum, the 50 WEMA, we can have that bullish momentum preserved and the price rally can actually continue afterwards,” he explained in a YouTube update on Monday.As such, $30,000 may simply have been a “really hefty discount” rather than a bearish watershed for Bitcoin."
679,"Following the worst May for Bitcoin’s (BTC) price in the past 10 years, the largest cryptocurrency is likely to continue falling in the short term, according to JPMorgan analysts.Weakened institutional demand is likely to drag the Bitcoin price below $30,000, JPMorgan strategist and Bitcoin expert Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in the latest research note to clients.Based on Bitcoin’s volatility ratios to gold, the JPMorgan analyst forecasted that Bitcoin will continue to trade between $24,000 and $36,000 in the mid-term. “The fair value for bitcoin based on a volatility ratio of Bitcoin to gold of around x4 would be 1/4th of $145k or $36k. The fair value for Bitcoin based on the current volatility ratio of Bitcoin to gold of around x6 would be 1/6th of $145k or $24k. We thus see a fair value range of $24k to $36k over the medium term,” the note reads.Panigirtzoglou said that JPMorgan still sees a $145,000 price mark as a long-term “theoretical target” for BTC’s price, “assuming a convergence of Bitcoin volatility to that of gold and an equalization of bitcoin allocations to that of gold in investor portfolios.”“$145k is the price of Bitcoin that would equalize it with the private sector holdings of gold for investment purposes of around $2.7tr at the moment. Needless to say, full convergence or equalization of volatilities or allocations is unlikely in the foreseeable future,” the strategist wrote, adding:Panigirtzoglou noted that institutional investors appear reluctant to buy the dip in the aftermath of a major crypto crash on May 19. “We note that the mere rise in volatility, especially relative to gold, is an impediment to further institutional adoption as it reduces the attractiveness of digital gold vs. traditional gold in institutional portfolios,” the strategist stated. JPMorgan previously suggested that large institutional investors were dumping BTC in favor of gold as Bitcoin touched five-month lows near $30,000.On Monday, Peter Brandt, a veteran financial analyst and trader, questioned whether Bitcoin’s price is likely to bounce in the near future. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $36,638, down around 1% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. The cryptocurrency has lost around 37% over the past 30 days but is still up 286% over the past year."
680,"Starling, a United Kingdom-based online bank, is preparing to resume payments to cryptocurrency exchanges after suspending crypto exchange deposits last week.A spokesperson for Starling told Cointelegraph on Tuesday that the bank is set to restart payments to crypto exchanges on June 23 after temporarily suspending the feature as a measure to protect its customers.Starling blocked payments to some cryptocurrency exchanges last week, citing “high levels of suspected financial crime with payments to some cryptocurrency exchanges.” The bank said that it will reverse the measure after adopting “additional checks specifically for payments to crypto exchanges.”The spokesperson stressed that the action was “not an issue for Starling, but for all banks,” referring to official parliamentary comments regarding the legal status of crypto exchanges in the United Kingdom. John Glen, a member of the U.K. Parliament for Salisbury and the economic secretary to the Treasury, said last Friday that only five companies were authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority to operate a crypto business in the country.According to data from the FCA official website, these companies includee two Gemini-affiliated firms, Gemini Europe Services and Gemini Europe, Diginex’s Digivault, crypto-friendly bank Ziglu, and Archax exchange.“Of the firms assessed to date over 90% have withdrawn their application following FCA intervention. There are 167 crypto asset businesses with outstanding applications,” Glen stated.The latest regulatory remarks came after some British banks, such as National Westminster Bank, reportedly warned its customers about crypto scams and fraud. Some users reported that NatWest sent a related warning to clients last Thursday.According to a report from The Telegraph on Saturday, other U.K. banks such as Barclays and Monzo have also blocked users from transferring money to some cryptocurrency platforms. A spokesperson for Barclays told Cointelegraph that the firm ""has not blocked customers from interacting with cryptocurrency platforms."" Monzo did not respond to the request for comment."
681,"Bitcoin (BTC) may have just had its worst monthly candle in 10 years, but it could still surge to new all-time highs this year, said popular analyst PlanB.In a tweet on Tuesday, the creator of the stock-to-flow-based BTC price models said that Bitcoin is behaving like during its 2013 bull run.After its drop to $30,000 and several retests of that level, concerns are starting to appear over a bigger drop taking BTC/USD toward $20,000 and lower.This would mean that for the first time, Bitcoin crosses the all-time high from a previous bull market, in this case from 2017.For PlanB, however, such an event is unlikely. Moreover, recent price action is far from unheard of — in fact, it could just mean that the market is rehashing its 2013 — rather than 2017 — performance.Uploading the latest incarnation of his stock-to-flow cross-asset (S2FX) model, he highlighted similarities between 2021 and Bitcoin’s behavior from years long past.“New dot: May close $37,341.. -35% .. we knew bitcoin would not go up in a straight line and several -35% drops are possible (and indeed likely) in a bull market,” he wrote in accompanying comments.S2FX places Bitcoin in multiple phases, in which it goes from a fringe phenomenon to a full-blown asset class. Its ambitious forecasts call for an average BTC price of $288,000 during the current halving cycle, which runs between 2020 and 2024.The pullback sparked questions over the model’s longevity, which PlanB has always stressed is not guaranteed.Nonetheless, with its demands still met by the market, the 2013 narrative remains a strong contender for explaining Bitcoin’s wild ride this year.As Cointelegraph reported, accumulation practices among long-term holders may also result in a “double top” scenario playing out in 2021 — just like in 2013.For veteran trader Peter Brandt, who is arguing for such a scenario this week, a rush to new all-time highs may come only after a further dramatic pullback. This in itself, however, would also be in line with historical precedent. "
682,"Cryptocurrencies’ persistent growth and ever more mainstream adoption are keeping international monetary authorities on their toes. In fresh comments this week, Stefan Ingves, the governor of Riksbank — Sweden’s central bank — said that digital assets’ rising popularity raises the stakes for regulators, central bankers and lawmakers worldwide:Devising regulatory frameworks for an asset that was initially designed to circumvent the very architecture and rules of traditional finance is no easy task. In the United States, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles raised his concerns that current regulatory provisions for crypto are inadequate, indicating that the Fed is in the process of looking into how best to tackle the issue. Quarles’ remarks were made amid a week of wild volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin (BTC) temporarily shedding a steep $15,000 in value in one fell swoop.The European Union has, meanwhile, pledged to “put in place a comprehensive framework enabling the uptake of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and crypto-assets in the financial sector” by 2024 — one that will, equally, tackle the risks involved in these technologies’ mainstream uptake. In Sweden, Åsa Lindhagen, the minister for financial markets, has said that the government is already engaged in strengthening regulatory standards for cryptocurrency exchanges. Various crypto regulatory approaches remain, she said, a “work in progress at the international level.” Ingves has himself remarked that cryptocurrency regulations “will probably come at different times in different areas.” Yet when it comes to the “very important issue” of money laundering, Lindhagen pointed to the need for cross-border coordination between regulators worldwide.As regulators mull how to approach the phenomenon of decentralized crypto assets, the Swedish central bank is meanwhile making headway with its development of a central bank digital currency, the e-krona. Its proof-of-concept uses Corda, a distributed ledger technology solution from R3. Ingves has previously indicated the currency could be operational within five years."
683,"As cryptocurrency markets grew in the first quarter of 2021, South Korean banks saw record volumes of deposits and withdrawals to local crypto exchanges.South Korean commercial banks processed 64.2 trillion won ($57.9 billion) of transactions on real-name bank accounts linked to crypto exchanges in Q1 2021, according to data from Financial Supervisory Service acquired by Democratic Party member Kim Byung-wook.The Q1 results comprise data from lenders like Shinhan Bank, online bank K Bank and Korean NH NongHyup Bank, as well as four major local crypto exchanges including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit, local business publication The Maeil Business Newspaper reports Tuesday.According to the data, crypto flows on verified bank accounts in South Korea surged over 40% year-over-year from 37 trillion won ($33.4 billion) in Q1 2020.South Korean banks have also recorded a major increase in fees paid by crypto exchanges, with K Bank receiving nearly 5 billion won ($4.5 million) in crypto commissions from Upbit exchange in Q1. This is almost a tenfold increase from 560 million won ($504,000) in Q4 2020, the report notes.NH Nonghyup Bank reportedly received 1.3 billion won ($1.2 million) and 330 million won ($297,000) from Bithumb and Coinone, respectively, in Q1 2021, while Shinhan Bank received 145 million won ($131,000) from Korbit, the data showed.Kim said that the “growing speculative fever in crypto markets fueled by market liquidity” led to the marked increase in the number of real-name bank accounts for crypto trading and crypto exchange-derived fees.“The financial authorities and major commercial banks should roll up their sleeves to protect crypto investors from possible crypto scams and external hacking attacks targeting local coin operators,” the official said.As previously reported, South Korean financial regulators require local digital asset service providers to acquire verifiable accounts in their real names from banks."
684,"Bitcoin (BTC) faces the prospects of falling further even after its price made a strong recovery after crashing from $65,000 to $30,000 in May 2021.So, it reflects in the latest statements from Peter Brandt, chief executive of global trading firm Factor LLC, who questioned, if not asserted, the longevity of the ongoing relief rally in the Bitcoin market, especially after a 50%-plus price crash.The veteran commodity trader challenged “BTC price historians” to identify a single instance in the last decade that saw Bitcoin logging a new record high seven months after crashing more than 50%. He also asked to refer to one case when a 50% decline in Bitcoin’s price did not lead up to at least a 70% correction.Challenge to $BTC price historians
In past 10 years (since May 2011) please identify a single (even one) instance:
1. When a 50%-plus correction did not lead to at least a 70% correction
2. When a 50%+ correction made a new ATH within 7 monthsOne of the Twitterati responded with two instances: the March 2020 rebound, wherein Bitcoin’s price recovered to its all-time high above $20,000 eight — if not seven — months after crashing to $3,850 in March from its long-term cyclical high of $13,880 in June 2019; and the 2013 bull run that saw the cryptocurrency rising by more than 2,450% eight months after bottoming out near $45 in an 80% overnight crash.Brand said, “nope to both,” apprehensively because Bitcoin’s prices took an additional month to reclaim their record highs in both cases. Nevertheless, the veteran’s questions remained cryptic enough due to its selective timeframe and as to what they were attempting to prove about the crypto market bias in the first place.huh? why? your 2020 reasoning...maybe....but 2013 was legit a 50%+ drop and rage to ATH in November that year. How can you invalidate that price move?On-chain analyst Willy Woo guessed that Brandt was trying to forecast a further price crash in the Bitcoin markets, based on the cryptocurrency’s historical responses to a 50%-plus price correction event.Woo attempted to pour cold water on Brandt’s fractal-oriented bearish market outlook by referring to “fundamentals.”“All drops of that scale with long recoveries was from a starting point where the price was overextended above fundamental valuation,” responded Woo.Woo himself did not explain what he meant by the term “fundamentals.” His active followers on Twitter took up the charge to clarify that the analyst referred to the “network effect” caused as investments sitting in gold and cash-oriented portfolios find a place in anti-inflationary holdings.Bitcoin rose from its March 2020 bottom to a new record high near $65,000 majorly because investors saw its scarcity as a defense against higher inflation.In retrospect, interest rate suppressions, a $120-billion bond purchasing program, and the United States government’s trillions of dollars worth of stimulus packages — aimed at curbing the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy — led investors to risk-on assets, such as Bitcoin and stocks.On May 12, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that the country’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) had risen to 4.2% year-over-year, logging its fastest climb since 2008. That tends to increase Bitcoin’s appeal among individuals and organizations looking for hedging against inflation in the long run, especially as higher consumer prices punish savers by forcing the U.S. dollar valuations lower.“This is the number one reason why I am bullish on something like Bitcoin,” said Anthony Pompliano, investor at Pomp Investments, in January 2021.Meanwhile, some analysts anticipate Bitcoin to continue declining, much in line with what Brandt hinted. One of them is Richard Durant, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, who called Bitcoin a “sentimental asset” that cannot rise without positive price catalysts, adding that “it is unclear at this stage what they could be.”Analysts at BiotechValley Insights wrote that Bitcoin’s rise against inflation fears does not make the flagship cryptocurrency a hedge. They referred to the May 19 price crash that appeared a week after the U.S. labor bureau reported a 4.2% CPI reading.“Bitcoin is more correlated to high-risk momentum growth stocks like TSLA than to safe-haven assets such as gold or bonds,” they noted.Meanwhile, Brandt, who correctly predicted the 2018 Bitcoin price crash, appeared more technically focused on the next market outlook. In March 2021, he had anticipated the BTC/USD exchange rate to hit $200,000 in either the third or the fourth quarter this year.Meanwhile, Brandt was also the one to decide that he should keep his money in equities instead of cryptocurrencies just as Bitcoin’s prices were approaching a breakout move above $12,000 in September 2020. The cryptocurrency closed the year at around $29,000.In March 2020, Brandt anticipated BTC to fall to $1,000. But the cryptocurrency reversed its bearish course upon testing upper $3,800 levels as support."
685,"The transaction fees of Bitcoin and Ethereum have slumped to six-month lows as the markets cool after the recent crypto downturn.According to BitInfoCharts, the average price of performing a transaction using Bitcoin has fallen from an early-April all-time high of $62.77 to around $7.20 — an 88% drop over just six weeks. The falling Bitcoin transaction fees appear to have been driven by a decline in overall market activity, with daily volumes evaporating from more than $67 billion on May 10 to $30 billion as of this writing, according to CoinGecko. The meteoric 2021 crypto bull run has seen the average transaction fees associated with using Bitcoin or the Ethereum mainnet frequently skyrocket to unprecedented levels in recent months.In February 2021, Bitcoin’s fees nearly tripled in two weeks following a Feb. 8 announcement that Tesla added $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin to its balance sheet.The news sparked a surge in crypto speculation, with the price breaking its former high of $40,000 before topping out at $54,410. Data from CoinGecko shows that 24-hour volume for Bitcoin (BTC) increased by nearly double from $57 billion on Feb. 7 — the day before Tesla’s announcement — to $101 billion on Feb. 23.The average price of Bitcoin fees again surged to a record high of $62.77 on April 21 after the price of BTC spiked to tag a local top of $64,804 on April 14. Bitcoin’s fees peaked on April 21, sparked by an increase in market activity as the markets began showing weakness as traders raced each other to cash out near the highs.Data from YCharts also shows that average Ethereum fees have dropped from May 20’s record high of $72.21 to just $4.80 — a 93% reduction in less than two weeks. Increasing adoption of Ethereum-powered decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens saw average fees increase from $3.50 at the beginning of the year to new highs of nearly $40 by the end of February.While developers sought to discipline the fee markets through April’s Berlin hard fork, a speculative frenzy surrounding Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other ERC-20 dog tokens drove further congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, again pushing fees to record highs last month. Ethereum’s transaction fees last established a new all-time high of $71.21 on May 19, with Cointelegraph reporting that a rush of traders racing to exit leveraged positions on-chain amid plummeting crypto prices was responsible for the hike. Complex smart contract transactions incurred fees of more than 10 times the average at the peak of the market turmoil, with CoinShares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors claiming to have paid more than $1,000 for a single transaction."
686,"The Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami has been touted as the largest Bitcoin event in crypto history, with organizers expecting a huge turnout.The event, running for three days from June 3 at the Mana Convention Center in Miami’s Wynwood neighborhood, will play host to a number of industry executives and personalities.Crypto luminaries scheduled for attendance include former congressman Ron Paul, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, pro-crypto Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, Square co-founder Jack Dorsey and cryptographer Nick Szabo, among others.The organizers are expecting more than 50,000 attendees, according to a Fox Business report.Miami has emerged as a major tech hub in recent years, with the Wynwood neighborhood, in particular, evolving into a hub for technology and innovation. The crypto conference was previously held in Los Angeles, but organizers decided to move it due to venue availability issues. On the official website, event organizers stated:A “whale pass” entry ticket is being offered with starting bids at 3 Bitcoin (BTC). The pass allows entry to Bitcoin 2021, five celebrity-suite tickets to the upcoming Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Logan Paul boxing match, three vintage bottles of 1996 Dom Pérignon, a meet-and-greet with pro skateboarder Tony Hawk, and access to VIP concierge services.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez is among Bitcoin 2021’s speakers. Suarez has gained fame within the crypto community for his pro-Bitcoin stance and incentive schemes intended to bolster digital asset adoption across the city.In February, Suarez stated that Miami city employees would be able to get their salaries paid in Bitcoin instead of United States dollars if they wanted to. At the time, he also revealed that he was considering financing his reelection campaign in BTC.In April, Jackson, Tennessee followed Miami's lead, with Mayor Scott Conger announcing the city was actively exploring offering its employees to be paid in cryptocurrency, and consider mining Bitcoin that would be added to the city’s balance sheet."
687,"Bitcoin started the week off with an abrupt bullish breakout to $37,500, a level some analysts have identified as a crucial “line in the sand,” but the rally was short-lived, as BTC met selling near the lower arm of the bearish pennant that can be seen on multiple timeframes. While many traders are concerned that the 2021 bull market is now over and considering whether gains should be locked in, on-chain data shows that long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders have been accumulating in preparation for a potential 2013-style double-pump that has the potential to elevate BTC to a fresh all-time high.Ether (ETH), on the other hand, rallied 8% to $2,677 as chatter about a possible “flippening” between Bitcoin and Ethereum continues to be a topic of discussion. Most recently, Bloomberg speculated that Ether could one day surpass Bitcoin as the world’s cryptocurrency of choice.Further insights into what is feeding the uncertainty in the markets can be found in the most recent “Week On-Chain” report from Glassnode, which looked at the activity of short-term holders (STH), who are newer market entrants holding coins younger than 155 days, and long-term holders (LTH) who hold coins older than 155 days.According to the Average Spent Output Lifespan (ASOL) metric, which provides insight into the average age of all UTXOs spent that day, LTHs primarily held through the recent dip as evidenced by the ASOL falling dramatically “back to levels below the accumulation range seen between $50,000 and $60,000.”Further proof that it has been STHs who are behind the sell-off can be found by comparing the amount of on-chain Bitcoin transfer volume that is in profit (LTHs) to the at a loss (STHs).According to data from Glassnode, LTHs were seen taking profits early in the 2021 rally from $10,000 to $42,000 before their spending “reached a fairly stable baseline,” with last week’s sell-off “having little effect on their spending patterns” indicating “that LTHs are generally unwilling to liquidate coins at reduced prices.”This compares to the behavior of STHs who “increased their spending by over 5x during this sell-off with the maximum spending occurring near the current local low of the market.”Evidence of this can also be found in a review of the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for STHs, who continue to realize losses by spending coins that were accumulated at higher prices at the current lower prices, indicating capitulation.According to Glassnode:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

688,"Bitcoin (BTC) is fast approaching its worst monthly performance in a decade, but some investors are using this as an opportunity to buy ultra-bullish long-term derivatives. There are currently over $900 million in call (buy) options aiming at $100,000 and higher, but what exactly are those investors seeking?Options instruments can be used for multiple strategies, which include hedging (protection) and also aiding those betting on specific outcomes. For example, a trader could be expecting a period of lower volatility in the short term but, at the same time, some significant price oscillation toward the end of 2021.Most novice traders fail to grasp that an investor might sell an ultra-bullish call (buy) option for September to improve gains on a short-term strategy, therefore not expecting to carry it until the expiry date.The chart above shows the net result of selling a Bitcoin $40,000 July 30 put. If the price remains above that threshold, the investor scores 0.189 BTC gain. Meanwhile, any outcome below $33,700 will yield a negative result. For example, at $30,000, the net loss is 0.144 BTC.The same trade will occur in the example shown below, but the investor will also sell 40 contracts of the $140,000 call option for Sept. 24. The investor is letting go of gains from a potential price increase in exchange for higher net profit at present levels.Take notice of how the same $40,000 outcome now results in a 0.464 BTC gain, and any price level above $26,850 yields a positive result. However, due to ultra-bullish calls, the trade will also net negative outcomes if Bitcoin trades above $68,170 on July 30.Therefore, analyzing those ultra-bullish options separately doesn't always provide a clear picture of investors' intentions.There are currently 24,625 Bitcoin call option contracts at $100,000 or higher, equivalent to $910 million in open interest.Sure, it sounds like a lot, but the current market value of these ultra-bullish options is $15.4 million. For example, a Dec. 31 call option with a $120,000 strike is worth $1,500.As a comparison, a $30,000 protective put option for July 30 is worth $2,700. Therefore, instead of focusing exclusively on open interest, one should factor in the actual cost for each option.While these flashy $300,000 Bitcoin call options make headlines, they do not necessarily reflect true investors' expectations.For Bitcoin holders, it makes sense to sell call options of $100,000 and higher and pocket the premium. Worst case scenario, one will be making a sale in December at $100,000, which does not sound like a bad investment at all.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
689,"Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase following its May 19 crash from $42,600 to $30,000 on Coinbase. The flagship cryptocurrency recovered its losses quickly and reclaimed $40,000, but it failed to log a clear bullish breakout above this resistance level, and at the time of writing, the price remains pinned below $40,000.The latest price action in the Bitcoin (BTC) market has been, at best, choppy, with traders showing no clear indication of their short-term bias. Some analysts have predicted that if the BTC/USD price does not break above $40,000, it may very well fall to as low as $20,000 in the coming days.Interestingly, a handful of on-chain indicators tell a different story. One of the most interesting themes holding Bitcoin's bullish bias intact is witnessing long-term holders and accumulation addresses stacking more BTC during the recent price dip.Furthermore, a metric known as the ""Bitcoin Entity-Adjusted SOPR"" (spent output profit ratio) shows that the market is no longer selling Bitcoin at a loss on aggregate.Meanwhile, on-chain data shows that exchanges saw a decline in their reserves, a signal that traders have been withdrawing their digital assets to cold wallets or depositing them into decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity pools for more lucrative returns.While the short-term perspective may be tilted toward bears, the following three on-chain indicators hint that Bitcoin's price could be in the process of bottoming out.The correction in Bitcoin's price resulted in three kinds of reactions in the spot market. The first involved panic-selling by short-term traders who sold Bitcoin to minimize their losses, probably because they bought the cryptocurrency near its top. The second reaction involved HODLERs who decided to hold on to their exiting Bitcoin supply. They showed a long-term conviction in Bitcoin's bullish bias against supportive macroeconomic fundamentals — such as ultra-low interest rates, poor yields on government bonds, inflation fears and a declining U.S. dollar — that made hedging assets like Bitcoin look attractive to HODL.The best way to build wealth with #Bitcoin is to be boring. 2 fast, quick, simple, steps:

1. Buy
2. HODL

It's really that simple.The third reaction was a mix of HODLers and accumulators, with traders utilizing the Bitcoin price dip to buy more of the cryptocurrency at a ""discount.""Various on-chain indicators show a huge contrast between the Bitcoin reserves held by short-term holders and long-term holders during the price crash.For example, the ""Bitcoin: Spent Output Age Bands"" chart below saw a greater amount of selling last week coming from coins that were between one day and one week old. These coins kept moving in and out of the market, accurately reflecting the state of higher price volatility in the market last week.Meanwhile, coins that remained unspent for one to three months and three to six months also changed addresses in the wake of the recent price crash.Another Glassnode metric dubbed ""Bitcoin: Total Supply Held By Long-Term Holders"" shows that long-term holders — entities that hold Bitcoin for more than six months — became the largest beneficiaries of the tokens sold by the short-term holders.In a weekly note to clients, Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital and founder of Pomp Investments, said:This divergence pointed to long-term stability in Bitcoin's price as more and more serious holders took positions against the ongoing macroeconomic crisis.The net Bitcoin reserves held by cryptocurrency exchanges have also declined in the past seven days, showing that fewer and fewer traders now want to sell their Bitcoin holdings.The metric points to a typical trading behavior. Traders only deposit Bitcoin to their exchange wallets when they want to either sell it for fiat or trade it for other digital assets. As a result, the BTC reserves on trading platforms rise.Conversely, a higher degree of BTC withdrawals reflects traders' decision to hold the cryptocurrency. It means that Bitcoin will not face immediate sell-off pressure in the spot market, which is what the latest Glassnode readings show.The total number of accumulation addresses and the balance within these wallets are rising. An accumulation address is the one that has received at least two BTC transactions but has never moved the assets out of the address.In the last seven days, the number of these accumulation addresses has climbed, adding 7,430 new wallets to the list.Another metric dubbed ""Bitcoin: Supply Held by Entities with Balance 0.01 – 0.1"" shows that new users entered the Bitcoin network during the price dip. Additionally, the supply held by addresses that have between 0.001 BTC and 1 BTC in them increased in tandem, showing steady growth in retail interest."
690,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) massive drop in May 2021 is among its worst monthly performances, according to data from Bybt. The decline has divided the crypto community, with long-term investors considering the fall as a buying opportunity while short-term traders are dumping their positions out of fear.Glassnode data suggests that long-term HODLers and miners are using the current weakness to accumulate Bitcoin. This transfer of Bitcoin from weaker hands to stronger hands is a positive sign because long-term investors are unlikely to panic and dump their holdings on every bear market correction.In April, the U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index soared by 3.1% compared to a year ago, the biggest increase over 12 months since July 1992. This indicates that inflation is knocking on the doors. Several institutional investors may use the current correction to add Bitcoin to their portfolios as it is an uncorrelated asset and many consider it as a good hedge against inflation.Therefore, a sharp plunge below $30,000 looks unlikely. However, that does not mean a new bull market will start in a hurry. The price is likely to remain volatile and range-bound before the start of a sustained uptrend.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support and resistance levels.Bitcoin is in a downtrend. The downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in negative territory suggest the bears have the upper hand. However, the bulls have other plans as they are trying to start a relief rally.The BTC/USDT pair has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern. If the bulls push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the pair could start a move to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $44,750 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($50,161). Such a move will suggest that the downtrend could be over.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the resistance line of the triangle, the pair could extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days. A breakdown and close below the support line of the triangle will indicate the resumption of the downtrend.The bears could then pull the price down to $30,000 and if this level cracks, the selling may intensify and the pair could drop to $28,000 and then $20,000.Ether (ETH) has rebounded sharply off the support line of the symmetrical triangle as traders attempt to put a higher low. The price could now challenge the resistance line of the triangle where the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance.If the bulls push the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the 61.8% retracement level at $3,362.72. Such a move will suggest strong buying at lower levels. A break above $3,362.72 may signal an end of the downtrend.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($2,756) and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest the sellers have a minor advantage.If the price turns down from the resistance line of the triangle, the bears will try to sink the price below the support line of the triangle. If they succeed, the pair may retest the May 23 panic low at $1,728.74.Binance Coin (BNB) slipped below the $306.61 support on May 29 but the bears could not sustain the selling pressure at lower levels. The altcoin quickly bounced back above $306.61 on May 30, suggesting accumulation on dips.The bulls will now try to push the price to the 20-day EMA ($400), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies.The bears will then try to pull the price down to $211.70. On the contrary, if the bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA and the $428 resistance, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($512).Cardano (ADA) dipped below the 50-day SMA ($1.51) on May 29 but the bears could not capitalize on the breakdown. The altcoin bounced back above the 50-day SMA on May 30, indicating buying at lower levels.The flat 20-day EMA ($1.61) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This balance will tilt in favor of the buyers if they can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line. The ADA/USDT pair could then rally to $1.94 and if this level is crossed, the next stop could be a retest of the all-time high at $2.47.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will once again try to break the $1.33 support. If they succeed, the pair could drop to $1.24 and then $1.The bears pulled XRP below the $0.88 support on May 29 but they could not sustain the lower levels. The altcoin bounced back above $0.88 on May 30, indicating strong buying by the bulls.If the buyers can propel the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.08), it will suggest that a short-term bottom has been made at $0.65. The XRP/USDT pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA ($1.32) and later to the downtrend line.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the bears will try to pull the price back below $0.80. If they manage to do that, the pair may challenge the $0.65 support.The volatility in Dogecoin (DOGE) has reduced due to lack of aggressive buying or selling by traders. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating the bears have the upper hand.If the price turns down from the 20day EMA ($0.36), the bears will try to pull the price below the critical support at $0.21. If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern. The pair could then correct to $0.10 and then $0.05.Conversely, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to the overhead resistance at $0.47. A breakout of this resistance could result in a rally to $0.59.Polkadot (DOT) is trying to rebound off the support at $17.50. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not waiting for a dip to $15 to buy. The altcoin could rise to the $26.50 level, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 40 suggest the bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from $26.50, the DOT/USDT pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.The next bullish move could start if the buyers push the price above $26.50. That could result in a rally to $31.28 and then to the 50-day SMA ($33). Alternatively, the next leg of the downtrend could start if the bears sink the price below $15.Uniswap (UNI) is in a downtrend but the bulls are trying to form a higher low at $21.50. The price rebounded off this support on May 30 and the bulls will now try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($28.27) and the overhead resistance at $30.If they succeed, it will suggest the downtrend could be over in the short term. The UNI/USDT pair may then rally to the 50-day SMA ($33.94). This level may act as stiff resistance but if the bulls can clear the hurdle, the pair could rise to $38.15.The downsloping 20-day EMA suggests the bears have the upper hand but the RSI above 44 suggests the bulls are making a comeback.This positive view will nullify if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below $21.50. Such a move could result in a decline to the May 23 low at $13.04.Internet Computer (ICP) broke below the $120 to $168 range on May 28 but the bears have not been able to pull the price below the immediate support at $103.71. The price is stuck between $103.71 and $120 for the past three days.This tight-range trading indicates indecision among the bulls and the bears. If the uncertainty resolves to the downside, the ICP/USDT pair could challenge the May 19 low at $86.01. A break below this support could pull the price down to $60.On the other hand, if the bulls push and sustain the price above $120, it will suggest a lack of sellers at lower levels. The pair could then gradually move up to $168. A breakout and close above $168 could start a relief rally that may reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $243.08.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is attempting to rise above $685.36. If bulls sustain the price above this overhead resistance, the altcoin could rise to the 20-day EMA ($821), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on every minor rally. If the bears sink the price below $600, the BCH/USDT pair could fall to $468.13.On the contrary, if the bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that demand exceeds supply. That could start a rally to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $919.60 and then to the 50% retracement level at $1,059.07.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

691,"India’s central bank has issued an official notice regarding the fact that local banks are reportedly cautioning customers against using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).Published Monday, the notice points out that the Reserve Bank of India is aware of media reports that certain banks have cautioned their customers against crypto by referring to the RBI’s quashed, three-year-old circular.“Such references to the above circular by banks/ regulated entities are not in order as this circular was set aside by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on March 4, 2020 in the matter of Writ Petition,” the notice reads, emphasizing that the circular is no longer valid and cannot be cited.However, banks and other regulated financial institutions can still carry out customer due diligence processes related to Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer standards under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act of 2002, the RBI noted.The RBI’s statement comes in response to media reports claiming that some of India’s largest banks, like HDFC Bank and the State Bank of India, have cautioned their customers against dealing in digital currencies. Some users claimed that HDFC Bank cited the RBI’s 2018 order banning crypto trading in India. The ban was officially overturned in March 2020 by the Supreme Court of India.What Is This @HDFC_Bank @HDFCBank_Cares @pushpendrakum @CryptooAdy @pankjtanwar @CryptoPointHi @cryptokanoon @CryptooIndia pic.twitter.com/rAK9guLGs7The news adds to the prevailing uncertainty regarding the legal status of crypto in India. Earlier this year, anonymous sources claimed that the government was planning a blanket ban on crypto."
692,"Bitcoin (BTC) is at risk of a “flippening” from Ether (ETH), mainstream media claims as some familiar FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt —returns to the spotlight.As BTC/USD continues to flag below $40,000, an old argument has resurfaced — but major investors are fighting back.In an article on May 31, Bloomberg cited multiple sources claiming that in the future, Ether will overtake Bitcoin as the world’s cryptocurrency of choice.The largest altcoin “will likely exceed Bitcoin at some point in the future, as Ethereum will be superior when it comes to innovation and developer interest,” Tegan Kline, co-founder of Blockchain firm Edge & Node, told the publication.Another executive added that Ethereum has a “better growth story.”The argument is far from new and has appeared regularly throughout Ethereum’s existence. The Ethereum network’s recent major upgrade has kept its profile afloat, and ETH has outperformed Bitcoin over the past year and formed the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) phenomenon.ETH/BTC, long on a losing streak, reached its highest exchange rate in three years earlier this month.ETH has also managed to preserve more of its price gains than Bitcoin in recent days. As Cointelegraph reported, a key moving average remains intact for ETH/USD, while BTC/USD has failed to recapture ""lines in the sand.""For all its impressive performance, however, claiming that Ethereum will replace Bitcoin at the top is nonsensical, many argue — and not only staunch Bitcoin supporters.In an interview with The Hustle last week, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller became the latest non-technical figure to cast aside doubts about Bitcoin’s staying power.“I think — because it’s a brand, it’s been around for 14 years, because of the finite supply — it [Bitcoin] has sort of won the store-of-value game,” he said.For Druckenmiller, Ethereum is to Bitcoin what MySpace is to Google.“I’m a little more skeptical of whether it can hold its position. It reminds me a little of MySpace before Facebook,” he continued.Others have long pointed out that technically, Bitcoin and Ethereum have little in common. Bitcoin’s finite supply and years of resistance to attacks place it in a different league than any other cryptocurrency, and comparing another one to it is an apples-to-oranges comparison.“I generally think all the other digital currencies don’t really compete with Bitcoin and are in no way similar to Bitcoin,” Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, famously told the Unchained Podcast in August 2017."
693,"Singapore-based Bybit, the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchange by trading volume, has allegedly been running unregistered crypto services in Japan, according to an official warning.The Japan Financial Services Agency issued a formal warning letter to Bybit stating that the firm is not registered to operate crypto services in the country.The warning comes in response to Bybit’s marketing campaign that reportedly targeted Japanese investors, according to Norbert Gehrke, founder and representative director of tech hub Tokyo FinTech.“Such public reprimand for running an unregistered business has not occurred for a while, so one is to assume that the FSA has witnessed aggressive marketing by Bybit to Japanese investors that goes beyond the common transgressions of presenting their website in Japanese and not blocking Japanese IP addresses,” Gehrke wrote in a blog post.Gehrke claimed that Bybit’s Japanese website makes no mention that local investors are not allowed to access the platform and does not block local IPs from accessing it. He noted that other exchanges, like Panama-based crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, have blocked Japan-based IP addresses.According to a notice on Deribit’s Japanese Telegram channel, Deribit restricted Japanese users from accessing its platform on May 1, 2020. Bybit told Cointelegraph, “We take our legal obligations very seriously and engage with regulators and law enforcement in a collaborative fashion. We are aligned with the FSA in the goal of protecting our customers. We will continue to work with our legal advisors to assess the situation and identify the optimal approach to protect customers’ best interests.”In March, Bybit suspended services for customers in the United Kingdom following a blanket ban by the Financial Conduct Authority of retail crypto derivatives trading."
694,"A recent run-down in Bitcoin’s (BTC) price from about $65,000 to as low as $30,000 did not force long-term holders into selling, Glassnode data shows.The on-chain analytics platform revealed a spike in Bitcoin reserves held in wallets with lower unspent output just as BTC/USD’s bids were crashing.Meanwhile, the data also shows a Bitcoin collecting spree among miners — the entities that produce and supply newly minted cryptocurrencies for retail markets. As a result, the active BTC supply started declining in recent sessions.Short-term Bitcoin holders — the entities that hold the flagship cryptocurrency for less than a week after accumulating it — were the biggest sellers during the BTC/USD rate decline. Glassnode data suggested that newer market entrants panic-sold BTC during the May downturn, a month during which BTC lost 38% from its all-time high price.Bitcoin price volatility, meanwhile, continues to exploit short-term traders with double-digit percentage up/down moves. The 24-hour Bitcoin Volatility Index on TradingView settled around 19.70 on May 20 after bottoming out at 1.90 on April 2 — that marked a 936% climb during the period, wherein BTC/USD rose to hit an all-time high near $65,000 and corrected lower to reach $30,000.Elevated price fluctuations served as a signal that investors remained fearful or uncertain about Bitcoin’s next market bias. The intraday candles in the chart above showed persistent higher volatility — the one on Sunday closed 34% lower than the previous session. But overall, the trend appeared on its way to the downside.Glassnode anticipated that long-term holders realize their profits or losses at some point in time (PnL). The analytics portal cited a proprietary metric that checks on long-term holders’ exhausting levels — the point at which their ability to hold BTC breaks, and which prompts them to realize their profits or losses in the market.“The current degree of net unrealized PnL held by LTHs tests the 0.75 level, which has been the make or break level between past bull and bear cycles,” wrote Glassnode analysts.The only factor that separates the current Bitcoin holding scenario from the previous ones is the United States’ trillion-dollar deficits. The world’s largest economy has returned to its highest debt-to-GDP ratio since World War II. And on Friday, President Joe Biden announced another $6-trillion spending plan for 2022.In total, the plan would raise government spending to $8.2 trillion per year by 2031. It would mean annual fiscal deficits of over $1.3 trillion and $1.8 trillion in 2022.One of the biggest fears in the market is that increased government spending would lead to a dramatic rise in inflation.Demand for Bitcoin has surged among institutional investors for its anti-inflation narrative. Supporters note that there can only be 21 million BTC tokens in supply, making it an ideal store of value against an infinitely printable U.S. dollar.Corporates including Tesla, Square, MicroStrategy and Ruffer Investments have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as an alternative to cash. Billionaire investors, including Stan Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones and Mike Novogratz have also allocated a considerable portion of their investment portfolio to Bitcoin.Fundamentals continue to provide Bitcoin a bullish backstop.“Bitcoin was made for this moment,” noted Dan Held, director of growth marketing at Kraken. “We’re in the biggest money printing operation ever in human history, and Bitcoin is the only way out.”"
695,"Ireland’s central bank director general for financial conduct is the latest official to point out issues of Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency industry following a major market sell-off.The growing popularity of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is “of great concern,” the Central Bank of Ireland’s Derville Rowland warned recently.“Crypto assets are quite a speculative, unregulated investment,” and investors should be “really aware they could lose the whole of that investment.” Rowland stated after crypto markets shed nearly $1 trillion in a matter of days in one of the biggest historic crypto sell-offs.Rowland’s perspective on crypto is set to contribute to the global regulation of the space, as the official will take over as chairwoman of the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) investment management standing committee in July. Earlier this year, the financial authority outlined the same concerns around crypto, stating that these types of assets are not regulated and pose significant risks for investors due to its highly-volatile nature.As one of the top executives of Ireland’s central bank, Rowland is known for her stringent stance on financial violations, as well as her involvement in major enforcement investigations. In March, the central bank fined Ireland’s largest stock broker Davy for breaching market rules, eventually pushing the firm to put itself up for sale.Aside from pointing the finger at crypto, Rowland also reportedly outlined the problem of “gamification” of stock investing, referring to coordinated trading via social media platforms, including Reddit-driven GameStop short squeeze. The official said that the ESMA and Ireland’s central bank have held discussions on the issue. While there’s not yet a timeline for any new rules, regulations need to be “technology neutral, so that you’re not getting better protections in older paper-based processes than you are in more online processes,” Rowland said.A number of central bank officials have rang the alarm on crypto investment recently. In early May — prior to a downturn on crypto markets — the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned that cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value, and that people should only buy them if they’re prepared to lose their money. Last week, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda slammed Bitcoin, arguing that most of the trading was speculative."
696,"Bitcoin (BTC) is starting a new week bearish or as a firm “buy” depending on the source — what happens next?After a week of uninspiring price performance, the largest cryptocurrency is still stuck in the lower $30,000 range.With inflation worrying traditional markets and summer months traditionally good for bulls, there may yet be cause for optimism. In Bitcoin, anything can happen, however, and surprises swing both ways.Cointelegraph Markets takes a look at five factors to consider when charting where BTC/USD might head next.It’s a quiet day for stocks and commodities thanks to holidays in the United States, United Kingdom and elsewhere in the West.That said, Asian markets are mostly stable anyway, as traders gear up for the beginning of the traditionally slower summer period.Zooming out, however, and the picture gets decidedly less steady. The reason, sources are telling mainstream media, is inflation.Long a concern amid the international rebound from the coronavirus, fuelled by huge central bank liquidity creation, the long-term impact of engineered “recoveries” worldwide is looming large on the horizon.Some telltale signs are already here, such as spiraling manufacturing costs, which may not be fully reflected.“Policymakers have committed to accepting a higher level of inflation, higher volatility in inflation and as that happens, you will see inflation moving structurally higher,” Mixo Das, an equity strategist at JPMorgan Asia, told Bloomberg.Inflation is by its very nature the antithesis of a Bitcoin standard, given the cryptocurrency’s fixed supply and diminishing issuance curve, which cannot be manipulated.As such, demand from institutions and those with large exposure to cash should continue to expand in line with inflation, which is being increasingly tolerated by central banks at higher levels.In a debate about Bitcoin’s energy usage earlier this month, Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, suggested that around 10% of global wealth is already eradicated by inflation every year.It’s a somewhat gloomy picture for Bitcoin hodlers on Monday as the weekend failed to produce signs of a bullish price rebound.At the time of writing, BTC/USD is under $36,000, having slowly drifted downward since hitting local highs of $41,000 last week.Those highs came soon after another retest of $30,000 support that saw Bitcoin bounce at $31,000, reestablishing the familiar trading corridor it has moved in since the capitulation event earlier in May.Depending on whom you ask, this setup is either a golden accumulation opportunity or a nightmare — and the split seems to match with market experience.According to fresh data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, at current levels, old hands are adding to their BTC stack, while recent buyers continue to sell to them.This classic “weak-hands-to-strong” direction is nothing new, but its pace is increasing.Miners, too, are back to buying, reversing a brief cascade of selling, which accompanied the first dip to $30,000.“This chart is INSANE!” popular Twitter account Lark Davis responded, highlighting the sense of excitement among longtime market participants.Bitcoin’s weekly relative strength index (RSI), a key metric for divining overbought and oversold territory, is also circling lows, which have only been beaten by the March 2020 crash and the $3,100 capitulation in December 2018.In terms of bull or bear, there are “lines in the sand” for traders, which Bitcoin still needs to preserve to retain its bull market crown.In its latest market update, trading suite DecenTrader highlighted the 200-day moving average (DMA) and 20-week moving average (WMA) as significant levels to watch.The 200 DMA currently sits at just above $40,000 — the place at which BTC/USD saw rejection last week — while the 20 WMA is higher at near $49,000.“Should Bitcoin find sufficient demand in the low 30s, the 20 WMA would be expected to act as resistance,” DecenTrader summarized.The idea that Bitcoin could descend to its 2017 high of $20,000 is unpopular for many, including PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow-based (S2F) price models.While acknowledging that his models were still being “tested” by price swings, the idea of a fresh capitulation down to $20,000 is not something he considers likely.“Of course I disagree, S2F and on-chain point to much higher prices ($100-288K). Time will tell,” he said during Twitter discourses last week.He added that Bitcoin’s “realized price” — a calculation of BTC/USD based on the price at which each coin last moved — is now $23,000. During the 2013 and 2017 bull runs, realized price shot up by an order of magnitude — and this year is yet to copy them.“At $23K we have some way to go IMO,” he commented alongside a chart showing realized price against the 200 WMA.For some counterpoint, an example of the hidden bullishness, which may serve to characterize near-term price action, lies in exchange funding rates.Currently healthily negative, these suggest that it’s very much a case of shorts paying longs under current circumstances.“Open interest has failed to recover with leverage participants being largely wiped out in the sell off and not re-entering. Funding has also remained low / negative which further echo’s the market,” DecenTrader added.As Cointelegraph reported, the capitulation of leveraged bets during the $30,000 sell-off has effectively reset market composition as traders avoid taking risks.This should allow more organic price growth fuelled by genuine demand from those more likely to hodl BTC for the long term rather than as a short-term speculative bet.Is this the worst May ever? In terms of monthly returns for Bitcoiners, it definitely looks like it.On the last day of May 2021, the mood is likely anything but positive, as monthly losses for hodlers total almost 40%.By comparison, May tends to be a lucrative month for BTC/USD — in 2017 and 2019, for instance, the pair gained more than 50% in May.2018 was an outlier with 19% losses, but even these pale in comparison to this year. May 2021 is currently on track to be the worst month since 2013 in terms of both Q1 and Q2 performance.And yet, doom and gloom are far from everywhere. Beyond Bitcoin, altcoin markets are showing signs of life, led by a continued rebound for XRP, up 13% on the day.As traders note, volumes for the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH), in particular, are promising, and contrast bear market behavior, which tends to see little trading activity.“We shouldn’t bother too much about a weaker BTC as it might follow the stronger alt/usd pairs or continue its chop/sideways while alts go up,” trader Cypto Ed concluded."
697,"Traders are using various strategies to determine whether Bitcoin’s price has bottomed, but on-chain activity and derivatives data hint that the situation remains precarious.Has Bitcoin’s price bottomed yet? According to Twitter user Noshitcoins, derivatives and on-chain data signal that further downside could be in store.Traders have been trying to time the much-anticipated trend reversal ever since Bitcoin (BTC) initiated its 48% correction to $30,000 on May 12. The move culminated with $12 billion worth of futures long positions being liquidated, and to date, trader confidence remains somewhat dampened.The community started looking everywhere for trend reversal signs, including technical patterns, United States CPI inflation data and Bitcoin exchange deposits. For example, some analysts have stated that a higher high, followed by a move above $40,000, would be enough.However, two days later, Bitcoin managed to break the $40,000 level, although the move didn’t last for more than six hours. Meanwhile, other traders inferred that a retest of the $30,000 bottom is needed before a bounce.Although there could be empirical evidence or even logic backing those statements, market prices don’t always react to external news or previous chart formations. Unlike stocks, Bitcoin investors can’t rely on commonly used valuation multiples or even comparables.Sure, a digital store of value is one use case, but at the same time, it is uncensorable and easily transferable. Furthermore, some users value Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer fiat convertibility outside of Know Your Customer-regulated exchanges. Another factor to consider is the investors who are increasing their Bitcoin portfolio due to the lack of correlation with traditional financial assets.This panacea of diverse and sometimes conflicting narratives creates barriers for modeling the market’s potential, adoption status and even measuring the effectiveness of recent developments.Some will cheer for Tesla and large companies building up Bitcoin reserves, while others couldn’t care less about who’s holding BTC and instead focus on the challenges of scalability and fungibility.Call options allow the buyer to acquire Bitcoin at a fixed price when the contract expires. Put options, on the other hand, provide insurance for buyers and protect against price drops.Whenever market makers and professional traders lean bullish, they will demand a higher premium on call (buy) options. This trend will cause a negative 25% delta skew indicator. On the other hand, if downside protection is more costly, the skew indicator will become positive.A 25% delta skew oscillating between a negative 10% and a positive 10% is usually deemed neutral. This balanced situation held until May 16, as Bitcoin lost the critical $47,000 support, which had held for 76 days.As the markets deteriorated, so did the 25% delta skew indicator, and the cost of protective options spiked. Therefore, until the metric establishes a more neutral pattern nearer to the 5% level, it seems premature to call the market bottom.Traders also monitor the number of BTC that has been active lately. This indicator can’t be deemed bullish or bearish by itself, as it does not provide information on how old the involved addresses are.The 500% price rally from Oct. 1, 2020, and the $64,900 peak on April 14, 2021, caused a major increase in the supply moved in the months before the rally. When this metric presents a sharp decrease, it indicates that investors are no longer interested in participating at the current price level.There are currently 2.2 million BTC active over the past 30 days, and this is significantly higher than levels seen before October 2020.As things currently stand, traders should not be so that Bitcoin has bottomed, at least until the market no longer has relevant activity surrounding the sub-$40,000 level.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

698,"Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to sustain any price level during the current pullback, indicating a lack of demand at higher levels. Does this mean that the bull trend is over and the institutional investors are abandoning the crypto markets?No! It is the other way around. Glassnode’s weekly newsletter pointed out that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) premium is rising, suggesting that institutional investors are accumulating at lower levels.GBTC is not alone, another popular vehicle for institutional investors, the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has also witnessed strong capital inflows. According to analysts at Glassnode, this shows “early signs of renewed institutional interest.""Another metric that may be signaling a possible bottom in Bitcoin is its dominance chart, which looks similar to the early part of 2017. If Bitcoin’s dominance follows a similar trajectory to 2017, it will indicate that Bitcoin is still some distance away from its peak and altcoin season still has room to run.Now that the monthly options and futures expiry has passed, investors are likely wondering if Bitcoin could start a sharp recovery next week and which altcoins will rally if that happens. Let's look at 5 cryptocurrencies that could start trending moves this week.Bitcoin’s brief breakout could not clear the hurdle at the 200-day simple moving average ($41,014) on May 26 and 27, indicating the bears are defending this level aggressively. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($41,327) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the oversold zone suggest the bears are in control.If the BTC/USDT pair breaks the $33,000 support, the next stop could be the $30,000 to $28,000 support zone. If this zone also gives way, the pair may witness panic selling and a drop to $20,000 is possible.The longer the price stays below the 200-day SMA, the more difficult it will become for the bulls to start the next leg of the uptrend.However, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above the 200-day SMA, it will suggest strong buying at lower levels. That could clear the path for a possible rally to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $48,231.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle, which generally acts as a continuation pattern. If bears sink the price below the triangle, the pair could drop to $30,000 and then to the pattern target at $20,316.On the other hand, the setup may act as a reversal pattern if bulls push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the triangle. Such a move will suggest the downtrend is over and the pair could rally to the target objective at $51,951.Polygon (MATIC) has bounced off the 20-day EMA ($1.58) today, indicating that bulls are buying on dips to this support. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.However, the MATIC/USDT pair has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. If bulls push the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the pair could rise to $2.70 and then start its journey to the pattern target at $4.20.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the resistance line of the triangle, the pair could extend its stay inside the triangle. A break and close below the triangle will signal weakness and could result in a drop to $0.80.The 4-hour chart shows the relief rally is facing resistance at the downtrend line. If the bears sink the price below the $1.51 support, the pair will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern that could result in a drop to $0.68.Conversely, if buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, the bullish momentum could pick up and the pair could challenge the $2.43 resistance. A break above this level could result in a rally to $2.70.EOS attempted a recovery, which fizzled out at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $7.89 on May 27. However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the $5.60 support. This indicates that traders are not waiting for a deeper fall to buy.If bulls can push and close the price above the 20-day EMA ($6.95), it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could open the doors for a rally to the 50% retracement level at $9.23 and then to the 61.8% retracement level at $10.57.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears stall the next pullback attempt at the 20-day EMA or at $7.89. Such a move will increase the possibility of a break below $5.60. If that happens, the EOS/USDT pair could drop to the 200-day SMA ($4.52) and then to $3.57.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are defending the $5.60 support, indicating that the selling pressure has reduced. The flat 20-EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If bulls push the price above $6.81, the pair could rally to the 200-SMA and then to $8.69. A breakout and close above this resistance will signal that bulls are back in the game. Alternatively, if the bears sink the price below the $5.60 to $5 support zone, the pair could drop to $3.57.Repeated attempts by the bears to sink Monero (XMR) below the 200-day SMA ($222) have failed in the past few days. This suggests that bulls are accumulating at the current levels.The buyers attempted to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($294) on May 29 but the long wick on the candlestick shows strong selling at higher levels. However, the bulls are again likely to attempt to clear the hurdle at the 20-day EMA.If they succeed, the XMR/USDT pair could start a relief rally that may reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $368.45. This level may act as a stiff resistance because traders who had bought at higher levels may close their positions.This positive view will nullify if the price turns down and plummets below the 200-day SMA. In such a case, the pair may drop to $175 and then to $124.69.The 4-hour chart shows a symmetrical triangle formation, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. The flattish 20-EMA and the RSI near the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.This advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls if they can push and sustain the price above the triangle. The price could then rally to the 200-SMA, which may act as a stiff resistance.On the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the triangle, the pair could drop to $175 and then to $124.69.AAVE is attempting to rebound off the strong support at $280. This level has not been broken on a closing basis since Jan. 26, hence the bulls are likely to defend it aggressively. The 200-day SMA ($290) just above the level is an added advantage.However, the downsloping 20-day EMA ($398) and the RSI below 43 suggest the short-term trend favors the bears. The sellers will try to stall any relief rally at the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the AAVE/USDT pair may again correct to $280.A break and close below this support could start a downtrend and the decline could extend to $160. Conversely, if the bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to $489, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls bought the dip to $280. The 20-EMA is flattening out, indicating the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the pair could rally to $418. A breakout and close above this resistance could result in a rally to $480.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the 20-EMA or the downtrend line and plummets below $280. If that happens, the bears will try to pull the price below the May 23 low at $208.09 and start the downtrend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.
